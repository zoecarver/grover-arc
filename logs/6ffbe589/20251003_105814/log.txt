=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 10:58:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 11:08:33] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def is_empty(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row contains no non-zero elements."""
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            return False
    return True

def row_non_zeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    """Count the number of non-zero elements in a row."""
    count = 0
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def find_row_bounds(row: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the minimum and maximum column indices with non-zero elements in a row."""
    m = len(row)
    min_c = m
    max_c = -1
    for j in range(m):
        if row[j] != 0:
            if j < min_c:
                min_c = j
            if j > max_c:
                max_c = j
    return min_c, max_c

def get_all_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Compute row bounds for all rows in the grid."""
    return [find_row_bounds(row) for row in g]
```
These functions are helpful for basic analysis (emptiness, counts, bounds) and can be building blocks for better main block detection.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def find_main_block(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the start and end indices of the longest sequence of significant non-empty rows."""
    # This is broken: uses a fixed >2 threshold and longest streak, which includes/excludes wrong rows (e.g., sparse border rows in ex1/2, flips row order in ex3).
    # It fails to handle frame-like structures or non-contiguous significance.

def compute_main_bounds(row_bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start: int, end: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Compute the overall min and max column bounds for the main block."""
    # Partially helpful but over-relies on the flawed start/end, leading to shifted columns.

def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start: int, end: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Crop the grid to the main block and column bounds."""
    # Basic slicing works, but input bounds are often wrong, causing content loss or inclusion of empties.

def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Pad the cropped grid to a square by adding zero rows and columns centered."""
    # Generally correct for centering, but can produce oversized/off-center results if crop is wrong (e.g., 13x13 with uneven pads).
```
The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

[2025-10-03 11:08:33] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)

def get_span(row: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    first = None
    for i in range(n):
        if row[i] != 0:
            first = i
            break
    if first is None:
        return 0
    last = None
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if row[i] != 0:
            last = i
            break
    return last - first + 1 if last is not None else 0

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:22:23] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract or crop a subgrid from a larger input grid (likely square, with dimensions around 10-13 based on examples) that captures the "core" or primary patterned object(s) formed by non-zero numbers, while excluding border padding, empty rows/columns, or extraneous elements. The output should be a rectangular or square subgrid that matches the expected structure exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of the numbers (which seem to represent colors, labels, or connected components like blobs/shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid contains non-zero numbers (e.g., 3,8,6 in train1; 5,3,4 in train2; 4,1,2 in train3) arranged in patterns that likely form distinct "objects" or shapes, surrounded by zeros acting as background or padding; the task is to isolate the bounding box of the main object(s), but not just any dense area—subtleties include handling irregular shapes, multiple components, and ensuring the crop aligns precisely with the expected layout (e.g., including specific zero placements within the object).
 * Outputs must match the expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected is 13 rows x 13 columns, but generated is 12x12; train2 expected 10x10, generated 10x10 but content wrong; train3 expected 10x10 with rotated/shifted elements, generated 9x9?); mismatches in size indicate failure to detect the correct span or padding.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have "borders" or frames (e.g., 3's outlining in train1, 5's in train2/train3), internal zeros that are part of the shape (not to be cropped out), and asymmetric placements (e.g., objects not centered, with uneven padding); vertical and horizontal cropping must consider the minimal bounding box that includes all relevant non-zeros without trimming internal structure.
 * Connected components or spans: Non-zeros form blobs (e.g., 8's as one shape, 6's as another in train1), and the crop should encompass the largest or primary blob(s); however, it's not just max span—expected outputs shift or select specific alignments (e.g., train1 expected starts columns later, includes extra row/column with sparse 3's).
 * Padding and zeros: Expected outputs retain some outer zeros if they are part of the frame (e.g., train1 expected has leading/trailing zeros in rows), but exclude large empty borders; generated outputs often over-crop or misalign, removing necessary zeros or adding incorrect padding.
 * Multiple objects: Grids may have hierarchical or adjacent shapes (e.g., train1 has 3-frame around 8/6 innards; train2 has 5-frame with internal 3/4; train3 has 4-frame with internal 1/2), requiring the crop to include the enclosing frame without fragmenting internals.
 * Vertical selection: Not all rows with max horizontal span are equal; expected selects a contiguous block but shifted (e.g., train1 generated starts at row 1, expected includes row 0 and 12 with sparse elements).
 * Horizontal alignment: Left edge is not always the global min column; it must align to the frame's start (e.g., train1 generated left=1 based on min_first, but expected left=3 with more leading zeros).
 * Density vs. structure: Summing non-zero counts for vertical selection works partially but fails when multiple candidate blocks have similar sums; expected prioritizes structural integrity over max density.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero rows/columns in output only if they frame the object (e.g., train3 expected has patterned borders); test input has scattered 5/3/4 patterns, likely needing a crop that captures a central cross-like or framed shape.
 * Overall: The puzzle emphasizes exact reproduction of the "visible" core image, possibly from a larger canvas with margins; failures often stem from incorrect bounding box calculation, ignoring frame elements, or wrong vertical/horizontal slicing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes some potentially useful primitives for analysis, but they are flawed in application.

```python
from typing import List

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is helpful for measuring row density, useful for vertical block selection, but insufficient alone as it ignores column-wise or structural alignment.)

```python
def get_span(row: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    first = None
    for i in range(n):
        if row[i] != 0:
            first = i
            break
    if first is None:
        return 0
    last = None
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if row[i] != 0:
            last = i
            break
    return last - first + 1 if last is not None else 0
```
(This computes the width of the non-zero segment in a row, helpful for identifying max pattern size horizontally, but misses multi-segment rows or frame detection; could be extended for column spans.)

No other types or tools are provided; future attempts might benefit from functions to find bounding boxes (min/max row/col with non-zeros), detect connected components (e.g., flood fill for blobs), or compute minimal enclosing rectangle for specific values (e.g., trace 3-frames).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt provided, which attempts a cropping strategy based on max horizontal spans and vertical density sums, but all training examples fail due to dimensional mismatches (e.g., train1 generated 12x12 vs. expected 13x13) and content errors (e.g., wrong left alignment, missing sparse frame rows).
 * Worked partially: Horizontal span detection identifies a reasonable size (e.g., captures width of main patterns), and vertical density sum selects a dense block (e.g., train1 generated includes core 8/6 rows 2-10, which overlap expected).
 * Did not work: Over-relies on max span rows for left alignment (e.g., train1 min_first=1 from row1's 3, but expected left=3 to include more padding and align frame); vertical selection picks wrong start (e.g., train1 best_start=1, skipping row0's sparse 3's and excluding row12); adds incorrect padding in rows (e.g., train1 generated pads short rows with zeros on right, but expected has exact 13 cols without padding); ignores overall grid symmetry or frame tracing.
 * Train1: Generated shifts left edge too far left (starts at col1 with 0,0,3 vs. expected col3 with 0,0,0,3), includes wrong row block (rows1-12, missing top/bottom sparse rows, extra dense row10 that's not in expected block), and trims to 12 cols (loses right 3's); differences include misplaced 8's/6's (e.g., generated row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs. expected row2: [0,3,0,8,0,8,...])—unknown why exact positions mismatch, possibly due to wrong left/right calc.
 * Train2: Generated has correct 10x10 size but wrong content (e.g., row3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—generated fills internal zeros incorrectly, shifts 3's/4's leftward); includes row1 as [0,0,0,3,...] but expected has it as empty-ish [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]; vertical block starts too early, capturing wrong frame alignment.
 * Train3: Generated appears 9x9 (rows listed as 9, but code aims for size=9?), with shifted borders (e.g., row0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] vs. expected row9: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—seems rotated or flipped incorrectly); internal 1/2 placements wrong (e.g., row4: [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4] vs. expected row4: [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—generated adds extra leading 4's, loses padding); function get_span likely picks wrong max_s (9 vs. expected 10, trimming borders).
 * The core program(g) function is broken for dimension handling (assumes square crop of max_s, pads incorrectly, selects suboptimal vertical block); count_nonzeros and get_span are helpful but not sufficient—need better bounding box or frame detection; avoid overusing density sums without structural checks, as it leads to dense-but-misaligned crops.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears malformed/incomplete for the puzzle: it has 13 rows but varying lengths (some 13 elems, but structure is ragged); includes large empty rows (e.g., row2 all zeros, row10 all zeros), which likely shouldn't be in a core crop unless framing, but here they disrupt the pattern; the visible parts show a scattered 5/3/4 arrangement (e.g., row4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] seems like a horizontal bar, row6: [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] with a 4 insert), but it's vertically spread with empties, suggesting wrong vertical block selection (probably picked a non-contiguous or padded block including borders).
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Assuming test input has a central framed object with 5's as outer, 3's/4's inner (based on scattered non-zeros around center), expected should be a tight ~9-11x13 crop centering the cross/bar patterns without full empty rows (e.g., exclude top/bottom empties, align left to first 5/3 col ~4, right to last ~12); generated includes too many leading/trailing zeros per row and wrong row selection (e.g., starts with sparse row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0], but likely expected skips to denser block starting row4); it fails to capture a cohesive shape, outputting a "smeared" version with isolated elements—does not make sense as a core extraction, missing subtle frame alignment (e.g., 5's not properly bordering 3/4's).

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

 * Train2: Generated has correct 10x10 size but wrong content (e.g., row3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—generated fills internal zeros incorrectly, shifts 3's/4's leftward); includes row1 as [0,0,0,3,...] but expected has it as empty-ish [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]; vertical block starts too early, capturing wrong frame alignment.
 * Train3: Generated appears 9x9 (rows listed as 9, but code aims for size=9?), with shifted borders (e.g., row0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] vs. expected row9: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—seems rotated or flipped incorrectly); internal 1/2 placements wrong (e.g., row4: [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4] vs. expected row4: [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—generated adds extra leading 4's, loses padding); function get_span likely picks wrong max_s (9 vs. expected 10, trimming borders).

 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Assuming test input has a central framed object with 5's as outer, 3's/4's inner (based on scattered non-zeros around center), expected should be a tight ~9-11x13 crop centering the cross/bar patterns without full empty rows (e.g., exclude top/bottom empties, align left to first 5/3 col ~4, right to last ~12); generated includes too many leading/trailing zeros per row and wrong row selection (e.g., starts with sparse row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0], but likely expected skips to denser block starting row4); it fails to capture a cohesive shape, outputting a "smeared" version with isolated elements—does not make sense as a core extraction, missing subtle frame alignment (e.g., 5's not properly bordering 3/4's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def is_empty(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row contains no non-zero elements."""
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            return False
    return True

def row_non_zeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    """Count the number of non-zero elements in a row."""
    count = 0
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def find_row_bounds(row: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the minimum and maximum column indices with non-zero elements in a row."""
    m = len(row)
    min_c = m
    max_c = -1
    for j in range(m):
        if row[j] != 0:
            if j < min_c:
                min_c = j
            if j > max_c:
                max_c = j
    return min_c, max_c

def get_all_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Compute row bounds for all rows in the grid."""
    return [find_row_bounds(row) for row in g]
```
These functions are helpful for basic analysis (emptiness, counts, bounds) and can be building blocks for better main block detection.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def find_main_block(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the start and end indices of the longest sequence of significant non-empty rows."""
    # This is broken: uses a fixed >2 threshold and longest streak, which includes/excludes wrong rows (e.g., sparse border rows in ex1/2, flips row order in ex3).
    # It fails to handle frame-like structures or non-contiguous significance.

def compute_main_bounds(row_bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start: int, end: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Compute the overall min and max column bounds for the main block."""
    # Partially helpful but over-relies on the flawed start/end, leading to shifted columns.

def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start: int, end: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Crop the grid to the main block and column bounds."""
    # Basic slicing works, but input bounds are often wrong, causing content loss or inclusion of empties.

def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Pad the cropped grid to a square by adding zero rows and columns centered."""
    # Generally correct for centering, but can produce oversized/off-center results if crop is wrong (e.g., 13x13 with uneven pads).
```
The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 11:31:36] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely binary or simple numeric grids representing shapes or objects), where the goal is to identify and extract the "main" contiguous block or object (defined by non-zero cells), crop it to its minimal bounding box, and then pad it symmetrically to form a square grid of appropriate size, preserving the object's structure for further puzzle-solving or recognition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of rows of integers (likely 0s for empty space and non-zero values like 1s for filled cells in an object or shape).
 * Identify the "main block" by finding the row with the highest density of non-zero cells, then extend contiguously up and down to include all adjacent non-zero rows, assuming the object is a single connected vertical block without gaps.
 * After selecting rows, compute the tightest column bounds across those rows by finding the global min/first non-zero column and max/last non-zero column, ignoring fully zero rows or columns.
 * Crop to the bounding box (subgrid of selected rows and columns), then pad with zeros to make it square: first pad columns to match the max of height/width, centering the content; then pad rows similarly if needed.
 * Edge cases include empty grids (return a single [[0]] or similar minimal square), grids where the object doesn't span all columns/rows, or where non-zero counts are zero (handle gracefully without errors).
 * Subtlety: Padding must be centered (equal or floor/ceil split on both sides) to maintain visual symmetry, and the final size should be the max of the cropped height/width, not hardcoded.
 * Assume the grid is rectangular (all rows same length), but the object may not fill the entire grid—avoid including sparse or disconnected parts.
 * Non-zero cells might vary in value (e.g., different numbers for shading), but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding and cropping.
 * Potential for multiple objects: The code assumes one main block via max density row, but puzzles might require selecting the largest/densest without merging disconnected components.

These functions handle row density calculation, block selection, per-row bounds, cropping, and centered padding effectively, and can be reused or minimally fixed for future attempts.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Compute global min first and max last over selected rows."""
    min_c = len(bounds[0][0]) if bounds else 0  # Use a large number  # BROKEN: bounds[0][0] is int, len(int) errors
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
This function is broken due to attempting len() on an int (should initialize min_c to a large value like len(g[0]) instead of len(bounds[0][0])), causing runtime errors on all inputs; it cannot be used as-is and needs fixing to compute column bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the core logic of finding a dense contiguous row block via non-zero counts and extending boundaries, which aligns with extracting a main object.
 * Row and column bound calculation (via get_row_bounds) works in principle for tight cropping, and padding functions ensure centered square output, which seems essential for visual puzzles.
 * However, the entire program fails to execute due to a bug in compute_col_bounds (len() on int), producing errors instead of grids for all cases—nothing "works" in terms of runnable output.
 * Block selection assumes vertical contiguity without gaps, which may miss horizontal-only or disconnected objects, but it's a reasonable start if the puzzle focuses on single blobs.
 * Cropping and padding are applied in the right order (columns first, then rows), but untested due to the crash.
 * No extraction of multiple objects or handling of varying non-zero values beyond binary count; assumes one main block, which might overlook puzzles with noise or multiple components.
 * The main function handles empty grids minimally, but the error prevents verification.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of cropping/padding to square but zero progress on execution, as all attempts (this one) crash identically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or produce a valid grid—it indicates a runtime failure rather than an incorrect but runnable result.
 * No actual grid is generated, so it cannot match any expected cropped/padded square for the test input; the error occurs early in compute_col_bounds, preventing any output.
 * This differs from expectations (a padded square grid representing the main object) because the code crashes instead of processing the grid; likely the test input has a valid non-empty grid, but the bug blocks all progress.
 * Without seeing the test grid, the error suggests the code isn't robust to standard inputs (e.g., non-empty bounds tuples), and future fixes must ensure no type mismatches to handle the test case properly.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 11:31:36] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract or crop a subgrid from a larger input grid (likely square, with dimensions around 10-13 based on examples) that captures the "core" or primary patterned object(s) formed by non-zero numbers, while excluding border padding, empty rows/columns, or extraneous elements. The output should be a rectangular or square subgrid that matches the expected structure exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of the numbers (which seem to represent colors, labels, or connected components like blobs/shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid contains non-zero numbers (e.g., 3,8,6 in train1; 5,3,4 in train2; 4,1,2 in train3) arranged in patterns that likely form distinct "objects" or shapes, surrounded by zeros acting as background or padding; the task is to isolate the bounding box of the main object(s), but not just any dense area—subtleties include handling irregular shapes, multiple components, and ensuring the crop aligns precisely with the expected layout (e.g., including specific zero placements within the object).
 * Outputs must match the expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected is 13 rows x 13 columns, but generated is 12x12; train2 expected 10x10, generated 10x10 but content wrong; train3 expected 10x10 with rotated/shifted elements, generated 9x9?); mismatches in size indicate failure to detect the correct span or padding.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have "borders" or frames (e.g., 3's outlining in train1, 5's in train2/train3), internal zeros that are part of the shape (not to be cropped out), and asymmetric placements (e.g., objects not centered, with uneven padding); vertical and horizontal cropping must consider the minimal bounding box that includes all relevant non-zeros without trimming internal structure.
 * Connected components or spans: Non-zeros form blobs (e.g., 8's as one shape, 6's as another in train1), and the crop should encompass the largest or primary blob(s); however, it's not just max span—expected outputs shift or select specific alignments (e.g., train1 expected starts columns later, includes extra row/column with sparse 3's).
 * Padding and zeros: Expected outputs retain some outer zeros if they are part of the frame (e.g., train1 expected has leading/trailing zeros in rows), but exclude large empty borders; generated outputs often over-crop or misalign, removing necessary zeros or adding incorrect padding.
 * Multiple objects: Grids may have hierarchical or adjacent shapes (e.g., train1 has 3-frame around 8/6 innards; train2 has 5-frame with internal 3/4; train3 has 4-frame with internal 1/2), requiring the crop to include the enclosing frame without fragmenting internals.
 * Vertical selection: Not all rows with max horizontal span are equal; expected selects a contiguous block but shifted (e.g., train1 generated starts at row 1, expected includes row 0 and 12 with sparse elements).
 * Horizontal alignment: Left edge is not always the global min column; it must align to the frame's start (e.g., train1 generated left=1 based on min_first, but expected left=3 with more leading zeros).
 * Density vs. structure: Summing non-zero counts for vertical selection works partially but fails when multiple candidate blocks have similar sums; expected prioritizes structural integrity over max density.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero rows/columns in output only if they frame the object (e.g., train3 expected has patterned borders); test input has scattered 5/3/4 patterns, likely needing a crop that captures a central cross-like or framed shape.
 * Overall: The puzzle emphasizes exact reproduction of the "visible" core image, possibly from a larger canvas with margins; failures often stem from incorrect bounding box calculation, ignoring frame elements, or wrong vertical/horizontal slicing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes some potentially useful primitives for analysis, but they are flawed in application.

```python
from typing import List

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is helpful for measuring row density, useful for vertical block selection, but insufficient alone as it ignores column-wise or structural alignment.)

```python
def get_span(row: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    first = None
    for i in range(n):
        if row[i] != 0:
            first = i
            break
    if first is None:
        return 0
    last = None
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if row[i] != 0:
            last = i
            break
    return last - first + 1 if last is not None else 0
```
(This computes the width of the non-zero segment in a row, helpful for identifying max pattern size horizontally, but misses multi-segment rows or frame detection; could be extended for column spans.)

No other types or tools are provided; future attempts might benefit from functions to find bounding boxes (min/max row/col with non-zeros), detect connected components (e.g., flood fill for blobs), or compute minimal enclosing rectangle for specific values (e.g., trace 3-frames).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt provided, which attempts a cropping strategy based on max horizontal spans and vertical density sums, but all training examples fail due to dimensional mismatches (e.g., train1 generated 12x12 vs. expected 13x13) and content errors (e.g., wrong left alignment, missing sparse frame rows).
 * Worked partially: Horizontal span detection identifies a reasonable size (e.g., captures width of main patterns), and vertical density sum selects a dense block (e.g., train1 generated includes core 8/6 rows 2-10, which overlap expected).
 * Did not work: Over-relies on max span rows for left alignment (e.g., train1 min_first=1 from row1's 3, but expected left=3 to include more padding and align frame); vertical selection picks wrong start (e.g., train1 best_start=1, skipping row0's sparse 3's and excluding row12); adds incorrect padding in rows (e.g., train1 generated pads short rows with zeros on right, but expected has exact 13 cols without padding); ignores overall grid symmetry or frame tracing.
 * Train1: Generated shifts left edge too far left (starts at col1 with 0,0,3 vs. expected col3 with 0,0,0,3), includes wrong row block (rows1-12, missing top/bottom sparse rows, extra dense row10 that's not in expected block), and trims to 12 cols (loses right 3's); differences include misplaced 8's/6's (e.g., generated row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs. expected row2: [0,3,0,8,0,8,...])—unknown why exact positions mismatch, possibly due to wrong left/right calc.
 * Train2: Generated has correct 10x10 size but wrong content (e.g., row3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—generated fills internal zeros incorrectly, shifts 3's/4's leftward); includes row1 as [0,0,0,3,...] but expected has it as empty-ish [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]; vertical block starts too early, capturing wrong frame alignment.
 * Train3: Generated appears 9x9 (rows listed as 9, but code aims for size=9?), with shifted borders (e.g., row0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] vs. expected row9: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—seems rotated or flipped incorrectly); internal 1/2 placements wrong (e.g., row4: [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4] vs. expected row4: [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—generated adds extra leading 4's, loses padding); function get_span likely picks wrong max_s (9 vs. expected 10, trimming borders).
 * The core program(g) function is broken for dimension handling (assumes square crop of max_s, pads incorrectly, selects suboptimal vertical block); count_nonzeros and get_span are helpful but not sufficient—need better bounding box or frame detection; avoid overusing density sums without structural checks, as it leads to dense-but-misaligned crops.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears malformed/incomplete for the puzzle: it has 13 rows but varying lengths (some 13 elems, but structure is ragged); includes large empty rows (e.g., row2 all zeros, row10 all zeros), which likely shouldn't be in a core crop unless framing, but here they disrupt the pattern; the visible parts show a scattered 5/3/4 arrangement (e.g., row4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] seems like a horizontal bar, row6: [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] with a 4 insert), but it's vertically spread with empties, suggesting wrong vertical block selection (probably picked a non-contiguous or padded block including borders).
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Assuming test input has a central framed object with 5's as outer, 3's/4's inner (based on scattered non-zeros around center), expected should be a tight ~9-11x13 crop centering the cross/bar patterns without full empty rows (e.g., exclude top/bottom empties, align left to first 5/3 col ~4, right to last ~12); generated includes too many leading/trailing zeros per row and wrong row selection (e.g., starts with sparse row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0], but likely expected skips to denser block starting row4); it fails to capture a cohesive shape, outputting a "smeared" version with isolated elements—does not make sense as a core extraction, missing subtle frame alignment (e.g., 5's not properly bordering 3/4's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely binary or simple numeric grids representing shapes or objects), where the goal is to identify and extract the "main" contiguous block or object (defined by non-zero cells), crop it to its minimal bounding box, and then pad it symmetrically to form a square grid of appropriate size, preserving the object's structure for further puzzle-solving or recognition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of rows of integers (likely 0s for empty space and non-zero values like 1s for filled cells in an object or shape).
 * Identify the "main block" by finding the row with the highest density of non-zero cells, then extend contiguously up and down to include all adjacent non-zero rows, assuming the object is a single connected vertical block without gaps.
 * After selecting rows, compute the tightest column bounds across those rows by finding the global min/first non-zero column and max/last non-zero column, ignoring fully zero rows or columns.
 * Crop to the bounding box (subgrid of selected rows and columns), then pad with zeros to make it square: first pad columns to match the max of height/width, centering the content; then pad rows similarly if needed.
 * Edge cases include empty grids (return a single [[0]] or similar minimal square), grids where the object doesn't span all columns/rows, or where non-zero counts are zero (handle gracefully without errors).
 * Subtlety: Padding must be centered (equal or floor/ceil split on both sides) to maintain visual symmetry, and the final size should be the max of the cropped height/width, not hardcoded.
 * Assume the grid is rectangular (all rows same length), but the object may not fill the entire grid—avoid including sparse or disconnected parts.
 * Non-zero cells might vary in value (e.g., different numbers for shading), but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding and cropping.
 * Potential for multiple objects: The code assumes one main block via max density row, but puzzles might require selecting the largest/densest without merging disconnected components.

These functions handle row density calculation, block selection, per-row bounds, cropping, and centered padding effectively, and can be reused or minimally fixed for future attempts.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Compute global min first and max last over selected rows."""
    min_c = len(bounds[0][0]) if bounds else 0  # Use a large number  # BROKEN: bounds[0][0] is int, len(int) errors

            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
This function is broken due to attempting len() on an int (should initialize min_c to a large value like len(g[0]) instead of len(bounds[0][0])), causing runtime errors on all inputs; it cannot be used as-is and needs fixing to compute column bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the core logic of finding a dense contiguous row block via non-zero counts and extending boundaries, which aligns with extracting a main object.
 * Row and column bound calculation (via get_row_bounds) works in principle for tight cropping, and padding functions ensure centered square output, which seems essential for visual puzzles.
 * However, the entire program fails to execute due to a bug in compute_col_bounds (len() on int), producing errors instead of grids for all cases—nothing "works" in terms of runnable output.
 * Block selection assumes vertical contiguity without gaps, which may miss horizontal-only or disconnected objects, but it's a reasonable start if the puzzle focuses on single blobs.
 * Cropping and padding are applied in the right order (columns first, then rows), but untested due to the crash.
 * No extraction of multiple objects or handling of varying non-zero values beyond binary count; assumes one main block, which might overlook puzzles with noise or multiple components.
 * The main function handles empty grids minimally, but the error prevents verification.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of cropping/padding to square but zero progress on execution, as all attempts (this one) crash identically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or produce a valid grid—it indicates a runtime failure rather than an incorrect but runnable result.
 * No actual grid is generated, so it cannot match any expected cropped/padded square for the test input; the error occurs early in compute_col_bounds, preventing any output.
 * This differs from expectations (a padded square grid representing the main object) because the code crashes instead of processing the grid; likely the test input has a valid non-empty grid, but the bug blocks all progress.
 * Without seeing the test grid, the error suggests the code isn't robust to standard inputs (e.g., non-empty bounds tuples), and future fixes must ensure no type mismatches to handle the test case properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

These functions are helpful for basic analysis (emptiness, counts, bounds) and can be building blocks for better main block detection.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def find_main_block(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the start and end indices of the longest sequence of significant non-empty rows."""
    # This is broken: uses a fixed >2 threshold and longest streak, which includes/excludes wrong rows (e.g., sparse border rows in ex1/2, flips row order in ex3).
    # It fails to handle frame-like structures or non-contiguous significance.

def compute_main_bounds(row_bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start: int, end: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Compute the overall min and max column bounds for the main block."""
    # Partially helpful but over-relies on the flawed start/end, leading to shifted columns.

    """Crop the grid to the main block and column bounds."""

def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Pad the cropped grid to a square by adding zero rows and columns centered."""
    # Generally correct for centering, but can produce oversized/off-center results if crop is wrong (e.g., 13x13 with uneven pads).
```
The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:41:53] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with different "colors" or values like 3,6,8) to extract the central or main non-zero content, crop it to a tight bounding box, and pad it symmetrically to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main block" should be identified as the longest consecutive sequence of rows with any non-zero elements, but care must be taken to exclude leading/trailing fully zero rows without including isolated zero rows within the block if they are structurally important (e.g., in example 1, internal zero positions are preserved but the block start/end must align precisely with the expected cropped area).
 * Column bounds must be computed only over the main row block, finding the minimal and maximal non-zero columns across those rows, but without expanding beyond the actual content—subtly, if a row in the block has no non-zeros (but is included in the block due to adjacency), its bounds should not affect min/max (current compute_col_bounds skips if l==-1, which is good, but may still misalign if block includes empty rows incorrectly).
 * Padding to square must be symmetric (centering the content) using zeros, first padding columns to match height, then rows to match the new width, but the target size is max(h,w) after cropping—issue is that if cropping misses parts, padding adds extra zeros in wrong places (e.g., in example 1, generated adds unintended non-zeros or shifts content left/right).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes with borders of zeros; the output should be square but retain the exact relative positions of non-zeros from the cropped area (e.g., example 2 shows misalignment in rows 3-4 where generated has [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] but expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], indicating column crop is too narrow or shifted).
 * Subtle element: Non-zeros represent "pixels" of different types (e.g., 3 might be borders, 6/8 fills), and the puzzle likely requires exact reproduction without altering values or introducing new ones—easy to miss that bounding box must be inclusive of all edge non-zeros but exclusive of outer empty space.
 * In example 3, the pattern alternates rows/columns, and generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips the starting row order, suggesting possible row reversal or reordering not handled (or wrong block detection includes extra).
 * General: Handle empty or all-zero grids by returning [[0]]; assume rectangular input; outputs are lists of lists, printed as rows.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), consider that main block detection uses row non-zero counts correctly but may over-include if zero rows are adjacent (e.g., example 1 generated includes row 0 with partial non-zeros? Wait, generated row 0 [0,0,3,0,3,...] suggests crop started too early or wrong min_c).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(x != 0 for x in row)
```
(This is useful for identifying dense rows.)

```python
def get_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing row densities to find blocks.)

```python
def find_main_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_len = 0
    best_start = 0
    curr_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            len_block = i - curr_start
            if len_block > max_len:
                max_len = len_block
                best_start = curr_start
            curr_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_len - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This identifies the longest run of non-empty rows, which is core but subtly fails if multiple blocks exist or if zeros inside should be included—worked partially for block length but wrong start in examples.)

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row min/max non-zero columns; essential for tight cropping, but only applied to main block rows.)

```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, num_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = num_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l != -1:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
(Combines row bounds for overall column crop; helpful but may yield empty if all rows in block are zero, leading to [[0]] fallback.)

```python
def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row_slice = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row_slice)
    return cropped
```
(Core cropping function; works for slicing but inherits errors from bounds.)

```python
def pad_dimension(lst: List[List[int]], target_size: int, is_rows: bool) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not lst:
        return [[0]]
    current_size = len(lst) if is_rows else len(lst[0])
    if current_size >= target_size:
        return lst
    pad_size = target_size - current_size
    left_or_top = pad_size // 2
    right_or_bottom = pad_size - left_or_top
    if is_rows:
        empty = [0] * len(lst[0])
        for _ in range(left_or_top):
            lst.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(right_or_bottom):
            lst.append(empty[:])
    else:
        for r in range(len(lst)):
            lst[r] = [0] * left_or_top + lst[r] + [0] * right_or_bottom
    return lst
```
(Handles symmetric zero-padding for dimensions; useful and correct in isolation, but applied after faulty crop leads to misaligned content.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    size = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, False)  # pad columns
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, True)   # pad rows
    return cropped
```
(Overall squaring logic; helpful but order matters—padding columns first then rows ensures square, but if w > h initially, row padding adds to height correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the concept of finding a main non-zero block via row counts and cropping to bounding box, which works for isolating content in dense grids but fails on precise start/end (e.g., Train 1 generated starts crop too early, including extraneous left-shifted 3's in row 0 and mismatches like row 2 [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—shifted right by 1 and wrong values at ends; unknown why exact mismatch but likely min_c off by 1).
 * Train 2: Cropping works for row block but column bounds too narrow, omitting right-side elements (generated row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—missing two 3's on right, extra 3 on left); padding adds zeros incorrectly around incomplete crop.
 * Train 3: Block detection includes wrong rows, leading to row order flip or extra borders (generated row 0 [4,0,4,...] vs expected row 0 [0,4,0,...]—seems like it cropped starting from an offset row and didn't reverse or adjust for alternating pattern).
 * find_main_block is helpful but broken for cases with internal zero rows that should be included (it skips on any zero count row, potentially splitting blocks—e.g., if a structural zero row has count=0 but is part of the object, it's excluded).
 * get_row_bounds and compute_col_bounds are essential and mostly correct but fail when block has varying widths, leading to over-tight crops.
 * pad_dimension and pad_to_square are not broken and helpful for final output, but unhelpful if upstream crop is wrong (don't modify, but ensure crop inputs are accurate).
 * Overall, no extraction of "objects" like connected components was attempted, which might be needed if multiple disjoint parts exist (not in this code, but could be relevant for subtleties like ignoring outliers); current approach assumes single main block.
 * Train 1 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., generated row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—extra 3 and wrong positions, likely from faulty end_r or max_c).
 * No function for connected component analysis or object extraction, which might be unhelpful here since the puzzle seems bounding-box based, not segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped a central 5x13-ish pattern (rows ~3-9 with 3's,5's,4's) but padded excessively to 13x13 with large zero borders, shifting the content downward and not centering it properly (e.g., non-zeros start at row 3, but expected likely tighter crop to rows 4-8, columns ~3-10, padded to ~7x7 square embedded in zeros without the wide empty top/bottom). 
 * It includes symmetric 5's on left/right but mismatches internal structure (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] suggests incomplete column crop, missing connections like the 4 in row 6); this doesn't make sense as a clean extraction—likely wrong min_c/max_c (too wide on sides, too narrow vertically) and over-pads without preserving the "object" shape (e.g., the cross-like 3's and inner 4 seem distorted). 
 * To handle test case, account for multiple horizontal bars (top/bottom 5's, middle 3's) by ensuring block includes all connected non-zeros vertically, even if sparse; current code probably picks a partial block, leading to missing top/bottom elements.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 11:41:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract or crop a subgrid from a larger input grid (likely square, with dimensions around 10-13 based on examples) that captures the "core" or primary patterned object(s) formed by non-zero numbers, while excluding border padding, empty rows/columns, or extraneous elements. The output should be a rectangular or square subgrid that matches the expected structure exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of the numbers (which seem to represent colors, labels, or connected components like blobs/shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid contains non-zero numbers (e.g., 3,8,6 in train1; 5,3,4 in train2; 4,1,2 in train3) arranged in patterns that likely form distinct "objects" or shapes, surrounded by zeros acting as background or padding; the task is to isolate the bounding box of the main object(s), but not just any dense area—subtleties include handling irregular shapes, multiple components, and ensuring the crop aligns precisely with the expected layout (e.g., including specific zero placements within the object).
 * Outputs must match the expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected is 13 rows x 13 columns, but generated is 12x12; train2 expected 10x10, generated 10x10 but content wrong; train3 expected 10x10 with rotated/shifted elements, generated 9x9?); mismatches in size indicate failure to detect the correct span or padding.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have "borders" or frames (e.g., 3's outlining in train1, 5's in train2/train3), internal zeros that are part of the shape (not to be cropped out), and asymmetric placements (e.g., objects not centered, with uneven padding); vertical and horizontal cropping must consider the minimal bounding box that includes all relevant non-zeros without trimming internal structure.
 * Connected components or spans: Non-zeros form blobs (e.g., 8's as one shape, 6's as another in train1), and the crop should encompass the largest or primary blob(s); however, it's not just max span—expected outputs shift or select specific alignments (e.g., train1 expected starts columns later, includes extra row/column with sparse 3's).
 * Padding and zeros: Expected outputs retain some outer zeros if they are part of the frame (e.g., train1 expected has leading/trailing zeros in rows), but exclude large empty borders; generated outputs often over-crop or misalign, removing necessary zeros or adding incorrect padding.
 * Multiple objects: Grids may have hierarchical or adjacent shapes (e.g., train1 has 3-frame around 8/6 innards; train2 has 5-frame with internal 3/4; train3 has 4-frame with internal 1/2), requiring the crop to include the enclosing frame without fragmenting internals.
 * Vertical selection: Not all rows with max horizontal span are equal; expected selects a contiguous block but shifted (e.g., train1 generated starts at row 1, expected includes row 0 and 12 with sparse elements).
 * Horizontal alignment: Left edge is not always the global min column; it must align to the frame's start (e.g., train1 generated left=1 based on min_first, but expected left=3 with more leading zeros).
 * Density vs. structure: Summing non-zero counts for vertical selection works partially but fails when multiple candidate blocks have similar sums; expected prioritizes structural integrity over max density.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero rows/columns in output only if they frame the object (e.g., train3 expected has patterned borders); test input has scattered 5/3/4 patterns, likely needing a crop that captures a central cross-like or framed shape.
 * Overall: The puzzle emphasizes exact reproduction of the "visible" core image, possibly from a larger canvas with margins; failures often stem from incorrect bounding box calculation, ignoring frame elements, or wrong vertical/horizontal slicing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes some potentially useful primitives for analysis, but they are flawed in application.

```python
from typing import List

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is helpful for measuring row density, useful for vertical block selection, but insufficient alone as it ignores column-wise or structural alignment.)

```python
def get_span(row: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    first = None
    for i in range(n):
        if row[i] != 0:
            first = i
            break
    if first is None:
        return 0
    last = None
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if row[i] != 0:
            last = i
            break
    return last - first + 1 if last is not None else 0
```
(This computes the width of the non-zero segment in a row, helpful for identifying max pattern size horizontally, but misses multi-segment rows or frame detection; could be extended for column spans.)

No other types or tools are provided; future attempts might benefit from functions to find bounding boxes (min/max row/col with non-zeros), detect connected components (e.g., flood fill for blobs), or compute minimal enclosing rectangle for specific values (e.g., trace 3-frames).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt provided, which attempts a cropping strategy based on max horizontal spans and vertical density sums, but all training examples fail due to dimensional mismatches (e.g., train1 generated 12x12 vs. expected 13x13) and content errors (e.g., wrong left alignment, missing sparse frame rows).
 * Worked partially: Horizontal span detection identifies a reasonable size (e.g., captures width of main patterns), and vertical density sum selects a dense block (e.g., train1 generated includes core 8/6 rows 2-10, which overlap expected).
 * Did not work: Over-relies on max span rows for left alignment (e.g., train1 min_first=1 from row1's 3, but expected left=3 to include more padding and align frame); vertical selection picks wrong start (e.g., train1 best_start=1, skipping row0's sparse 3's and excluding row12); adds incorrect padding in rows (e.g., train1 generated pads short rows with zeros on right, but expected has exact 13 cols without padding); ignores overall grid symmetry or frame tracing.
 * Train1: Generated shifts left edge too far left (starts at col1 with 0,0,3 vs. expected col3 with 0,0,0,3), includes wrong row block (rows1-12, missing top/bottom sparse rows, extra dense row10 that's not in expected block), and trims to 12 cols (loses right 3's); differences include misplaced 8's/6's (e.g., generated row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs. expected row2: [0,3,0,8,0,8,...])—unknown why exact positions mismatch, possibly due to wrong left/right calc.
 * Train2: Generated has correct 10x10 size but wrong content (e.g., row3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—generated fills internal zeros incorrectly, shifts 3's/4's leftward); includes row1 as [0,0,0,3,...] but expected has it as empty-ish [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]; vertical block starts too early, capturing wrong frame alignment.
 * Train3: Generated appears 9x9 (rows listed as 9, but code aims for size=9?), with shifted borders (e.g., row0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] vs. expected row9: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—seems rotated or flipped incorrectly); internal 1/2 placements wrong (e.g., row4: [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4] vs. expected row4: [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—generated adds extra leading 4's, loses padding); function get_span likely picks wrong max_s (9 vs. expected 10, trimming borders).
 * The core program(g) function is broken for dimension handling (assumes square crop of max_s, pads incorrectly, selects suboptimal vertical block); count_nonzeros and get_span are helpful but not sufficient—need better bounding box or frame detection; avoid overusing density sums without structural checks, as it leads to dense-but-misaligned crops.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears malformed/incomplete for the puzzle: it has 13 rows but varying lengths (some 13 elems, but structure is ragged); includes large empty rows (e.g., row2 all zeros, row10 all zeros), which likely shouldn't be in a core crop unless framing, but here they disrupt the pattern; the visible parts show a scattered 5/3/4 arrangement (e.g., row4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] seems like a horizontal bar, row6: [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] with a 4 insert), but it's vertically spread with empties, suggesting wrong vertical block selection (probably picked a non-contiguous or padded block including borders).
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Assuming test input has a central framed object with 5's as outer, 3's/4's inner (based on scattered non-zeros around center), expected should be a tight ~9-11x13 crop centering the cross/bar patterns without full empty rows (e.g., exclude top/bottom empties, align left to first 5/3 col ~4, right to last ~12); generated includes too many leading/trailing zeros per row and wrong row selection (e.g., starts with sparse row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0], but likely expected skips to denser block starting row4); it fails to capture a cohesive shape, outputting a "smeared" version with isolated elements—does not make sense as a core extraction, missing subtle frame alignment (e.g., 5's not properly bordering 3/4's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely binary or simple numeric grids representing shapes or objects), where the goal is to identify and extract the "main" contiguous block or object (defined by non-zero cells), crop it to its minimal bounding box, and then pad it symmetrically to form a square grid of appropriate size, preserving the object's structure for further puzzle-solving or recognition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of rows of integers (likely 0s for empty space and non-zero values like 1s for filled cells in an object or shape).
 * Identify the "main block" by finding the row with the highest density of non-zero cells, then extend contiguously up and down to include all adjacent non-zero rows, assuming the object is a single connected vertical block without gaps.
 * After selecting rows, compute the tightest column bounds across those rows by finding the global min/first non-zero column and max/last non-zero column, ignoring fully zero rows or columns.
 * Crop to the bounding box (subgrid of selected rows and columns), then pad with zeros to make it square: first pad columns to match the max of height/width, centering the content; then pad rows similarly if needed.
 * Edge cases include empty grids (return a single [[0]] or similar minimal square), grids where the object doesn't span all columns/rows, or where non-zero counts are zero (handle gracefully without errors).
 * Subtlety: Padding must be centered (equal or floor/ceil split on both sides) to maintain visual symmetry, and the final size should be the max of the cropped height/width, not hardcoded.
 * Assume the grid is rectangular (all rows same length), but the object may not fill the entire grid—avoid including sparse or disconnected parts.
 * Non-zero cells might vary in value (e.g., different numbers for shading), but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding and cropping.
 * Potential for multiple objects: The code assumes one main block via max density row, but puzzles might require selecting the largest/densest without merging disconnected components.

These functions handle row density calculation, block selection, per-row bounds, cropping, and centered padding effectively, and can be reused or minimally fixed for future attempts.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Compute global min first and max last over selected rows."""

            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
This function is broken due to attempting len() on an int (should initialize min_c to a large value like len(g[0]) instead of len(bounds[0][0])), causing runtime errors on all inputs; it cannot be used as-is and needs fixing to compute column bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the core logic of finding a dense contiguous row block via non-zero counts and extending boundaries, which aligns with extracting a main object.
 * Row and column bound calculation (via get_row_bounds) works in principle for tight cropping, and padding functions ensure centered square output, which seems essential for visual puzzles.
 * However, the entire program fails to execute due to a bug in compute_col_bounds (len() on int), producing errors instead of grids for all cases—nothing "works" in terms of runnable output.
 * Block selection assumes vertical contiguity without gaps, which may miss horizontal-only or disconnected objects, but it's a reasonable start if the puzzle focuses on single blobs.
 * Cropping and padding are applied in the right order (columns first, then rows), but untested due to the crash.
 * No extraction of multiple objects or handling of varying non-zero values beyond binary count; assumes one main block, which might overlook puzzles with noise or multiple components.
 * The main function handles empty grids minimally, but the error prevents verification.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of cropping/padding to square but zero progress on execution, as all attempts (this one) crash identically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or produce a valid grid—it indicates a runtime failure rather than an incorrect but runnable result.
 * No actual grid is generated, so it cannot match any expected cropped/padded square for the test input; the error occurs early in compute_col_bounds, preventing any output.
 * This differs from expectations (a padded square grid representing the main object) because the code crashes instead of processing the grid; likely the test input has a valid non-empty grid, but the bug blocks all progress.
 * Without seeing the test grid, the error suggests the code isn't robust to standard inputs (e.g., non-empty bounds tuples), and future fixes must ensure no type mismatches to handle the test case properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

    """Find the start and end indices of the longest sequence of significant non-empty rows."""

    """Pad the cropped grid to a square by adding zero rows and columns centered."""
    # Generally correct for centering, but can produce oversized/off-center results if crop is wrong (e.g., 13x13 with uneven pads).
```
The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with different "colors" or values like 3,6,8) to extract the central or main non-zero content, crop it to a tight bounding box, and pad it symmetrically to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main block" should be identified as the longest consecutive sequence of rows with any non-zero elements, but care must be taken to exclude leading/trailing fully zero rows without including isolated zero rows within the block if they are structurally important (e.g., in example 1, internal zero positions are preserved but the block start/end must align precisely with the expected cropped area).
 * Column bounds must be computed only over the main row block, finding the minimal and maximal non-zero columns across those rows, but without expanding beyond the actual content—subtly, if a row in the block has no non-zeros (but is included in the block due to adjacency), its bounds should not affect min/max (current compute_col_bounds skips if l==-1, which is good, but may still misalign if block includes empty rows incorrectly).
 * Padding to square must be symmetric (centering the content) using zeros, first padding columns to match height, then rows to match the new width, but the target size is max(h,w) after cropping—issue is that if cropping misses parts, padding adds extra zeros in wrong places (e.g., in example 1, generated adds unintended non-zeros or shifts content left/right).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes with borders of zeros; the output should be square but retain the exact relative positions of non-zeros from the cropped area (e.g., example 2 shows misalignment in rows 3-4 where generated has [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] but expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], indicating column crop is too narrow or shifted).
 * Subtle element: Non-zeros represent "pixels" of different types (e.g., 3 might be borders, 6/8 fills), and the puzzle likely requires exact reproduction without altering values or introducing new ones—easy to miss that bounding box must be inclusive of all edge non-zeros but exclusive of outer empty space.
 * In example 3, the pattern alternates rows/columns, and generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips the starting row order, suggesting possible row reversal or reordering not handled (or wrong block detection includes extra).
 * General: Handle empty or all-zero grids by returning [[0]]; assume rectangular input; outputs are lists of lists, printed as rows.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), consider that main block detection uses row non-zero counts correctly but may over-include if zero rows are adjacent (e.g., example 1 generated includes row 0 with partial non-zeros? Wait, generated row 0 [0,0,3,0,3,...] suggests crop started too early or wrong min_c).

        for r in range(len(lst)):
            lst[r] = [0] * left_or_top + lst[r] + [0] * right_or_bottom
    return lst
```
(Handles symmetric zero-padding for dimensions; useful and correct in isolation, but applied after faulty crop leads to misaligned content.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    size = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, False)  # pad columns
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, True)   # pad rows
    return cropped
```
(Overall squaring logic; helpful but order matters—padding columns first then rows ensures square, but if w > h initially, row padding adds to height correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the concept of finding a main non-zero block via row counts and cropping to bounding box, which works for isolating content in dense grids but fails on precise start/end (e.g., Train 1 generated starts crop too early, including extraneous left-shifted 3's in row 0 and mismatches like row 2 [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—shifted right by 1 and wrong values at ends; unknown why exact mismatch but likely min_c off by 1).
 * Train 2: Cropping works for row block but column bounds too narrow, omitting right-side elements (generated row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—missing two 3's on right, extra 3 on left); padding adds zeros incorrectly around incomplete crop.
 * Train 3: Block detection includes wrong rows, leading to row order flip or extra borders (generated row 0 [4,0,4,...] vs expected row 0 [0,4,0,...]—seems like it cropped starting from an offset row and didn't reverse or adjust for alternating pattern).
 * find_main_block is helpful but broken for cases with internal zero rows that should be included (it skips on any zero count row, potentially splitting blocks—e.g., if a structural zero row has count=0 but is part of the object, it's excluded).
 * get_row_bounds and compute_col_bounds are essential and mostly correct but fail when block has varying widths, leading to over-tight crops.
 * pad_dimension and pad_to_square are not broken and helpful for final output, but unhelpful if upstream crop is wrong (don't modify, but ensure crop inputs are accurate).
 * Overall, no extraction of "objects" like connected components was attempted, which might be needed if multiple disjoint parts exist (not in this code, but could be relevant for subtleties like ignoring outliers); current approach assumes single main block.
 * Train 1 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., generated row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—extra 3 and wrong positions, likely from faulty end_r or max_c).
 * No function for connected component analysis or object extraction, which might be unhelpful here since the puzzle seems bounding-box based, not segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped a central 5x13-ish pattern (rows ~3-9 with 3's,5's,4's) but padded excessively to 13x13 with large zero borders, shifting the content downward and not centering it properly (e.g., non-zeros start at row 3, but expected likely tighter crop to rows 4-8, columns ~3-10, padded to ~7x7 square embedded in zeros without the wide empty top/bottom). 
 * It includes symmetric 5's on left/right but mismatches internal structure (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] suggests incomplete column crop, missing connections like the 4 in row 6); this doesn't make sense as a clean extraction—likely wrong min_c/max_c (too wide on sides, too narrow vertically) and over-pads without preserving the "object" shape (e.g., the cross-like 3's and inner 4 seem distorted). 
 * To handle test case, account for multiple horizontal bars (top/bottom 5's, middle 3's) by ensuring block includes all connected non-zeros vertically, even if sparse; current code probably picks a partial block, leading to missing top/bottom elements.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:49:39] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid processing, where the goal is to identify the primary "object" or contiguous region of non-zero values in a 2D grid (likely representing an image or shape), crop it to its tight bounding box, and then pad the result to form a square grid while preserving the content. The output should be a transformed grid that isolates and normalizes the main feature for comparison or rendering.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of rows of integers (0 for empty/background, non-zero for filled/object pixels), and the "object" is defined by contiguous sequences of rows with non-zero counts, ignoring isolated or sparse rows.
 * Focus on the largest contiguous block of rows with any non-zeros to avoid including noise or separate components; subtle elements include handling rows with varying non-zero positions (e.g., irregular shapes) and ensuring column bounds are computed only over the selected rows.
 * Cropping must create a tight bounding box: min/max columns based on the first/last non-zero in each relevant row, but aggregated globally to avoid over-cropping jagged edges.
 * Padding to square should center the content (symmetric or near-symmetric padding with zeros) and handle cases where height and width differ, potentially starting from a 1x1 zero grid if empty.
 * Edge cases: empty grids, all-zero rows/columns, single-row/column objects, or grids where non-zeros don't align perfectly; avoid assuming uniform row lengths or non-negative values.
 * Non-zero values might represent different "colors" or intensities, but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding/cropping; preserve original values in the output.
 * Subtlety: Contiguous blocks reset on zero-count rows, so multiple objects might exist, but only the largest is selected—easy to miss if code doesn't properly scan for max length.
 * Global bounds must initialize correctly (e.g., min_col to infinity or grid width, max_col to -1) to handle rows with no non-zeros within the block.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is solid for row density; use it to identify active rows.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing; efficiently computes non-zero counts per row.)

```python
def find_largest_contiguous_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_length = 0
    best_start = 0
    current_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            length = i - current_start
            if length > max_length:
                max_length = length
                best_start = current_start
            current_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_length - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This correctly identifies the start/end of the largest run of non-zero-count rows; essential for isolating the main object vertically. Handles edge cases like all-zero grid returning (0,-1) or similar.)

```python
def get_row_first_last(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n  # Initialize to full width (beyond any valid index)
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row horizontal bounds; note initialization of first to n and last to -1 to handle all-zero rows gracefully, where (n, -1) indicates empty.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
(Reliable for extracting subgrid; assumes valid indices and handles empty slices.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    size = max(h, w)
    # Pad columns first if needed
    if w < size:
        pad_left = (size - w) // 2
        pad_right = size - w - pad_left
        for i in range(h):
            grid[i] = [0] * pad_left + grid[i] + [0] * pad_right
        w = size
    # Pad rows if needed
    if h < size:
        pad_top = (size - h) // 2
        pad_bottom = size - h - pad_top
        empty = [0] * size
        for _ in range(pad_top):
            grid.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(pad_bottom):
            grid.append(empty[:])
    return grid
```
(Effective for centering and squaring; handles empty grids and asymmetric padding well, preserving original values.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt demonstrates partial understanding of the puzzle by correctly identifying the need for contiguous row selection, per-row bounds, tight cropping, and square padding, but fails entirely due to a runtime error in all cases.
 * What worked: The vertical block detection (find_largest_contiguous_block) and per-row bounds (get_row_first_last) are logically sound and would isolate the main object if integrated properly; cropping and padding functions execute without issues in isolation.
 * What didn't work: The compute_global_bounds function is broken—it incorrectly initializes min_c as len(bounds[0][0]), where bounds[0][0] is an int (column index), causing "object of type 'int' has no len()" error on all inputs; this prevents any successful execution, so no outputs are generated for analysis.
 * No training examples or test passed; all resulted in the same execution error, indicating the bug blocks the entire pipeline.
 * The approach assumes the largest contiguous non-zero row block is the "object," which aligns with puzzle subtleties (e.g., ignoring noise), but untested due to crash.
 * Function compute_global_bounds is broken and unhelpful in its current form (causes crash; don't use without fixing initialization to something like min_c = float('inf') or grid width, and max_c = -1, then update only if l != -1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to the len() on int bug, so no actual grid is generated—completely incorrect and unusable for verification.
 * Expected test output should be a square-padded bounding box of the main contiguous object (e.g., if test input has a central shape spanning rows 2-5 and columns 3-7, output would crop to that 4x5 region, pad to 5x5 with zeros around, preserving non-zeros); the error prevents any match, and without seeing the input grid, it's unclear if the approach would otherwise align, but the crash confirms it does not produce a valid result.
 * This highlights the need to handle empty or edge rows in bounds aggregation without assuming non-empty tuples.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of only the obvious and consistent interactions/connections between components or properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (i.e., train inputs 1, 2, and 3 to their corresponding outputs). I ignored irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., isolated small elements outside any main structure that are consistently excluded without affecting others). I did not identify high-level puzzle solutions or force non-existent connections. Where a transformation or interaction could not be explained consistently (e.g., exact y-adjustments for certain small internal shapes), I noted it as unknown. No semantic meanings (e.g., "maze" or "star-like") were used, as they are not identifiable from the data and do not show consistent interactions.

#### 1. **Outer Frame Position → Internal Shapes' Positions (Consistent Translation Interaction)**
   - **Description**: The position (bbox min_x, min_y) of the outer frame component interacts with the positions of all internal shapes by determining a translation vector applied to their bboxes. The frame's min_x and min_y are subtracted from the internal shapes' bbox coordinates, normalizing the main structure to start at or near (0,0) in the output. This is consistent across all examples:
     - Train 1: Frame is Green (bbox [6,0,18,12]); translation vector (-6, 0) applied to internal Maroon and Pink.
     - Train 2: Frame is top row of Orange elements (effective min_x=6, min_y=2); translation vector (-6, -2) applied to internal Green, Yellow, and most Orange.
     - Train 3: Frame is top row of Blue/Yellow elements (effective min_x ≈8, min_y=2, but adjusted to effective (-5 to -8, -2) for main); translation applied to internal Blue, Red, and Yellow groups.
   - **Affected Properties**: Bbox x1, y1, x2, y2 of internal shapes (shifted uniformly for main/large shapes).
   - **Consistency Note**: Only applies to shapes fully contained within the frame's bbox; does not affect excluded elements. No change to bbox width/height.

#### 2. **Component Inclusion/Exclusion Based on Position Relative to Frame (Consistent Filtering Interaction)**
   - **Description**: A shape's position (bbox overlap or containment within the outer frame's bbox) interacts with the frame to determine if it is included in the output. Shapes completely outside the frame are excluded; internal ones are kept and translated (per interaction #1). This is consistent:
     - Train 1: Small Maroon/Green/Pink at high y (16-18, outside Green frame y0-12) excluded; internal small Maroon kept but further adjusted (see unknown below).
     - Train 2: Small Green at [1,15,1,15] and Yellow at [4,16,4,16] (x <6 or y > frame effective extent) excluded; all others inside frame kept.
     - Train 3: All listed elements appear internal to the overall structure (no clear "outside" like in 1/2, but top Blue/Yellow act as frame; no exclusions observed, all repositioned).
   - **Affected Properties**: Presence/absence of the entire shape in output (bbox and all properties ignored if excluded).
   - **Consistency Note**: Excluded shapes do not affect any other elements (no ripple effects observed).

#### 3. **Pixel Count Preservation (No Interaction with Other Properties)**
   - **Description**: Each shape's pixel count remains unchanged from input to output, indicating no consistent interaction with other shapes (e.g., no merging, splitting, or area transfer). This holds for all kept shapes across examples.
     - Applies to all colors (e.g., Maroon/Pink/Green in 1; Orange/Green/Yellow in 2; Yellow/Blue/Red in 3).
   - **Affected Properties**: None (static; interacts only with itself for consistency check).
   - **Consistency Note**: Pixels are invariant, even when positions change or shapes are translated/repositioned.

#### 4. **Holes Preservation (No Interaction with Other Properties)**
   - **Description**: Each shape's holes count remains unchanged from input to output, indicating no consistent topological interaction with other shapes (e.g., no filling holes or creating new ones via overlap). This holds for all kept shapes with holes >0.
     - Train 1: Shapes with holes=1 (Green, Pink, large Maroon) preserve it.
     - Train 2: All have holes=0, preserved (no counterexample).
     - Train 3: All have holes=0, preserved (includes Blue/Red with varying pixels).
   - **Affected Properties**: None (static; interacts only with itself for consistency check).
   - **Consistency Note**: No evidence of holes affecting movement or position (e.g., holed shapes translate same as non-holed).

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Interactions
- **Small Internal Shapes' Y-Position Adjustment**: In some cases, small internal shapes (e.g., small Maroon in train 1 at translated [2,2,3,3] but output [9,9,10,10]; Yellow in train 2 at translated [4,3,6,5] but output [4,4,6,6]) have their y-coordinates further modified (shifted down by additional amount) after the main translation. This suggests a possible interaction with the frame's height (e.g., relocation toward bottom-right) or other internal shapes (e.g., position-based "movement" influenced by nearby bboxes), but it is not consistent or explainable across all examples—absent in train 3 (no similar small adjustments observed for Yellow/Blue), and no clear trigger (color, holes, or overlap) is shared. Called out as unknown; no forced connection.
- **Color → Movement/Shift Amount**: Colors may influence the translation vector (e.g., frame is always Green/Orange/Blue top-row in examples, internal colors follow frame shift), but no consistent effect on speed/direction of movement (e.g., Yellow shifts differently in train 2 but not in train 3). Not obvious or uniform across all; unknown mechanism.
- **No Consistent Edge/Hole/Silhouette Interactions**: No evidence of edges, holes, or bbox silhouettes consistently affecting other shapes (e.g., no blocking or collision-based changes in all examples). Pixels/bbox sizes preserved without adjustment based on these.

No other interactions (e.g., position-to-color, hole-to-color, or shape-specific transforms) are obvious and present in every example. Elements like "black voids" or "yellow highlights" from the high-level description do not map to consistent data properties (e.g., no "void" entries in lists) and show no interactions. The test input was not analyzed for application, as the task is identification only.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 11:53:34] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of only the obvious and consistent interactions/connections between components or properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (i.e., train inputs 1, 2, and 3 to their corresponding outputs). I ignored irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., isolated small elements outside any main structure that are consistently excluded without affecting others). I did not identify high-level puzzle solutions or force non-existent connections. Where a transformation or interaction could not be explained consistently (e.g., exact y-adjustments for certain small internal shapes), I noted it as unknown. No semantic meanings (e.g., "maze" or "star-like") were used, as they are not identifiable from the data and do not show consistent interactions.

#### 1. **Outer Frame Position → Internal Shapes' Positions (Consistent Translation Interaction)**
   - **Description**: The position (bbox min_x, min_y) of the outer frame component interacts with the positions of all internal shapes by determining a translation vector applied to their bboxes. The frame's min_x and min_y are subtracted from the internal shapes' bbox coordinates, normalizing the main structure to start at or near (0,0) in the output. This is consistent across all examples:
     - Train 1: Frame is Green (bbox [6,0,18,12]); translation vector (-6, 0) applied to internal Maroon and Pink.
     - Train 2: Frame is top row of Orange elements (effective min_x=6, min_y=2); translation vector (-6, -2) applied to internal Green, Yellow, and most Orange.
     - Train 3: Frame is top row of Blue/Yellow elements (effective min_x ≈8, min_y=2, but adjusted to effective (-5 to -8, -2) for main); translation applied to internal Blue, Red, and Yellow groups.
   - **Affected Properties**: Bbox x1, y1, x2, y2 of internal shapes (shifted uniformly for main/large shapes).
   - **Consistency Note**: Only applies to shapes fully contained within the frame's bbox; does not affect excluded elements. No change to bbox width/height.

#### 2. **Component Inclusion/Exclusion Based on Position Relative to Frame (Consistent Filtering Interaction)**
   - **Description**: A shape's position (bbox overlap or containment within the outer frame's bbox) interacts with the frame to determine if it is included in the output. Shapes completely outside the frame are excluded; internal ones are kept and translated (per interaction #1). This is consistent:
     - Train 1: Small Maroon/Green/Pink at high y (16-18, outside Green frame y0-12) excluded; internal small Maroon kept but further adjusted (see unknown below).
     - Train 2: Small Green at [1,15,1,15] and Yellow at [4,16,4,16] (x <6 or y > frame effective extent) excluded; all others inside frame kept.
     - Train 3: All listed elements appear internal to the overall structure (no clear "outside" like in 1/2, but top Blue/Yellow act as frame; no exclusions observed, all repositioned).
   - **Affected Properties**: Presence/absence of the entire shape in output (bbox and all properties ignored if excluded).
   - **Consistency Note**: Excluded shapes do not affect any other elements (no ripple effects observed).

#### 3. **Pixel Count Preservation (No Interaction with Other Properties)**
   - **Description**: Each shape's pixel count remains unchanged from input to output, indicating no consistent interaction with other shapes (e.g., no merging, splitting, or area transfer). This holds for all kept shapes across examples.
     - Applies to all colors (e.g., Maroon/Pink/Green in 1; Orange/Green/Yellow in 2; Yellow/Blue/Red in 3).
   - **Affected Properties**: None (static; interacts only with itself for consistency check).
   - **Consistency Note**: Pixels are invariant, even when positions change or shapes are translated/repositioned.

#### 4. **Holes Preservation (No Interaction with Other Properties)**
   - **Description**: Each shape's holes count remains unchanged from input to output, indicating no consistent topological interaction with other shapes (e.g., no filling holes or creating new ones via overlap). This holds for all kept shapes with holes >0.
     - Train 1: Shapes with holes=1 (Green, Pink, large Maroon) preserve it.
     - Train 2: All have holes=0, preserved (no counterexample).
     - Train 3: All have holes=0, preserved (includes Blue/Red with varying pixels).
   - **Affected Properties**: None (static; interacts only with itself for consistency check).
   - **Consistency Note**: No evidence of holes affecting movement or position (e.g., holed shapes translate same as non-holed).

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Interactions
- **Small Internal Shapes' Y-Position Adjustment**: In some cases, small internal shapes (e.g., small Maroon in train 1 at translated [2,2,3,3] but output [9,9,10,10]; Yellow in train 2 at translated [4,3,6,5] but output [4,4,6,6]) have their y-coordinates further modified (shifted down by additional amount) after the main translation. This suggests a possible interaction with the frame's height (e.g., relocation toward bottom-right) or other internal shapes (e.g., position-based "movement" influenced by nearby bboxes), but it is not consistent or explainable across all examples—absent in train 3 (no similar small adjustments observed for Yellow/Blue), and no clear trigger (color, holes, or overlap) is shared. Called out as unknown; no forced connection.
- **Color → Movement/Shift Amount**: Colors may influence the translation vector (e.g., frame is always Green/Orange/Blue top-row in examples, internal colors follow frame shift), but no consistent effect on speed/direction of movement (e.g., Yellow shifts differently in train 2 but not in train 3). Not obvious or uniform across all; unknown mechanism.
- **No Consistent Edge/Hole/Silhouette Interactions**: No evidence of edges, holes, or bbox silhouettes consistently affecting other shapes (e.g., no blocking or collision-based changes in all examples). Pixels/bbox sizes preserved without adjustment based on these.

No other interactions (e.g., position-to-color, hole-to-color, or shape-specific transforms) are obvious and present in every example. Elements like "black voids" or "yellow highlights" from the high-level description do not map to consistent data properties (e.g., no "void" entries in lists) and show no interactions. The test input was not analyzed for application, as the task is identification only.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 12:05:10] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns (likely representing shapes, figures, or "objects" with pixel values like 3,5,6,8,4 indicating colors or types), where the goal is to extract the "main" or primary figure/object from the input grid, normalize its position (e.g., translate to top-left), compute a bounding box, and output a square grid representation padded with zeros, while ignoring or excluding noise, frames, or secondary elements. The output size is based on the max dimension of the extracted region, but the results suggest the extraction criteria (e.g., row selection, bounding box) are imprecise, leading to inclusions/exclusions of pixels that don't match expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain a "main" figure (dense cluster of non-zero pixels) surrounded by potential noise, frames, or disconnected elements (e.g., sparse lines or dots outside the core shape); the program must identify and isolate only the primary connected or consecutive component, excluding outer frames or isolated pixels.
 * Y-range selection is critical: use consecutive rows with non-zero sums, but prioritize the block with maximum total non-zero pixels to avoid noise; however, subtle disconnected parts (e.g., small protrusions or separate blobs) may need inclusion if part of the main structure, or exclusion if they are artifacts.
 * Bounding box computation must tightly fit the main figure's extent (min/max x/y of non-zeros in selected rows), but avoid expanding to include frame-like borders; translation shifts to (0,0) origin, and output is a square of side max(width, height) of the bbox, padded with zeros—do not return the original n x n size unless s == n.
 * Subtleties include handling asymmetric shapes (e.g., figures not centered), multiple potential "main" blocks (select largest by sum or area), and ensuring no pixel values are altered during extraction/translation—only positions change.
 * Noise handling: Grids may have zero-rows or sparse rows above/below/around the main figure; do not include them in the y-range or bbox unless they connect to the main structure.
 * Output must preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within the extracted region; mismatches often occur in top/bottom rows (e.g., extra 3s included as noise) or side alignments (e.g., shifted 8s or 6s).
 * Consider connected components: The main figure may not be fully rectangular; use row_bounds to find per-row min/max x, but aggregate carefully to avoid over-expansion.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return zero-filled n x n; if no main block, output zeros; varying grid sizes (10x10 or 13x13) mean s can be < n, leading to smaller outputs implicitly padded in display.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect y-range (including noise rows) or bbox (missing/extruding parts), resulting in shifted or incomplete figures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several modular functions for row analysis and extraction, which are partially useful for identifying and isolating regions but need refinement for accurate main figure selection (e.g., better y-range logic or component detection). No new types are defined, but Tuple[int, int] for bounds and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for pixels (y,x,value) are effective for handling positions and values.

```

The main `program` function composes these but is flawed in y-range/bbox selection; no explicit object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) is present, which might be needed for complex shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (all training examples failed); it correctly implements modular extraction/translation/padding but fails on core selection logic.
 * What worked: Pixel extraction preserves values; translation to (0,0) normalizes position; square padding handles varying bbox sizes; row_sums and row_bounds efficiently identify dense regions without full scans.
 * What didn't work: Y-range selection via max-sum consecutive rows includes noise (e.g., top/bottom sparse rows with 3s in train1), leading to bbox that captures extras; no handling for disconnected components or frames, causing over-inclusion; output size s often matches n but with misplaced pixels due to wrong min_y/max_y.
 * Train1: Generated includes extra 3s in row0 (positions 2,4) and row12 (3s at 3,4), but expected has 3s at 3 and 10 in row0, and 3s at 5 and 7 in row12; inner figure (8s,6s) is shifted/missing parts (e.g., generated row2 has 8s at 2-3 but expected at 3; row10 has 8s at 8-9 but expected at 9 missing); overall, figure is vertically expanded with noise, horizontally misaligned (unknown reason, possibly bbox min_x too low).
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 at 3 but expected all 0s except row1 3 at 6; row3 has 3s at 1-2 but expected 3 at 2; row4 has 5 at 0,3 at 2 but expected 5 at 0,3s at 1-2; row5 matches somewhat but row6 has 4s missing in expected positions; figure is incomplete/shifted rightward, with extra 3s in noise rows (e.g., row1), suggesting wrong y-range including top noise.
 * Train3: Generated row0/1 are [4,0,4,...]/[0,4,0,...] but expected swapped to [0,4,0,...]/[4,0,4,...], indicating possible rotation or frame misextraction; inner 1s/2s are misplaced (e.g., generated row2 has 1 at 5 but expected row2 all 0s except 1s at 3-4; row4 has 2s at 4-5 but expected row4 2s at 4-5 ok, but surrounding 1s wrong); frame is included but inverted, inner figure vertically shifted down by ~1 row (unknown reason, likely y-range starts too early).
 * Function `get_main_bbox` is helpful but broken when y-range is noisy (propagates errors); `find_main_y_range` is essential but insufficient (needs connectivity or size threshold); no unhelpful functions, but the composition in `program` assumes single main block—add component detection for multi-blob grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of normalization but misses subtle noise exclusion and precise component isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it extracts a partial figure (5s on sides, 3s/4s in middle) but places it starting from row1 (with row0 as [0s,3,3,0s] like noise or bottom fragment), repeats the pattern in rows1-2/4-5 but inverts or shifts (e.g., row2 has 3s at 4-8 but test input row? has different), adds isolated 3 in row6 middle, then pads with 7+ zero rows— this suggests wrong y-range (included top noise, excluded bottom?), incomplete bbox (missing left/right alignments, e.g., 5s at 0-1 and 11-12 but 3s not centered), and over-padding without centering. Expected likely a tight square of the central cross-like figure (3s horizontal, 4s vertical-ish, framed by 5s) translated to top-left without extras, possibly 7x7 or similar s<13, but output bloats to 13x13 with misplaced elements (e.g., duplicated rows 1/5 and 2/4 indicate loop error or wrong min_y). It fails to isolate the main "plus" shape, including apparent noise 3s, and doesn't match a clean normalized output.

[2025-10-03 12:05:22] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train examples, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** puzzle (train inputs 1, 2, and 3). Only properties/components with clear, consistent effects or links are included—no forced or inconsistent ones (e.g., no assumptions about rotation mechanics, as they are not uniformly explainable; hole counts are preserved but do not consistently affect other properties like position across all). Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., isolated bottom-placed small components with no transformation link) are excluded. Unknowns are noted where a connection exists but the exact effect cannot be explained without solving.

1. **Color → Preservation and grouping for transformation**:
   - Shape color is preserved for every corresponding component between input and output.
   - Components of the same color are grouped and transformed together (e.g., all Greens in train 1 and 2 translate as a set; all Yellows in train 2 and 3 are repositioned relative to non-Yellows; all Maroons/Blues/Reds maintain color-specific placements).
   - Effect: Color determines which components move as interacting units (rigid or relative repositioning), consistent across all—no color changes or mixing.

2. **Pixels (area count) → Preservation across all components**:
   - Pixel count for each individual component is identical in input and output for all transformed elements.
   - Effect: Interacts with color and holes to identify matching components (e.g., unique pixel values like 48 for Green in train 1, 6 for Yellow in train 2, 4 for Red in train 3 link input-output pairs directly).
   - Consistent: No pixel changes or mergers/splits observed in any example.

3. **Holes → Preservation, with potential link to central positioning (unknown effect)**:
   - Hole count (0 or 1) is preserved for every corresponding component.
   - Effect: Appears to interact with position for "central" components (e.g., hole=1 components like Green/Pink in train 1 are centered in output bbox; hole=0 centrals like Yellow in train 2 and Red in train 3 follow similar centering). However, the exact way holes affect movement or attachment is unknown, as it does not uniformly trigger changes across examples (absent in train 2 and 3 for mains).

4. **Position (bbox coordinates) → Translation offset from aggregate min position**:
   - Bbox min_x and min_y across all main (non-bottom) components determine a uniform translation offset applied to most components' positions (e.g., subtract min_x from all x, min_y from all y to align overall to [0,0]).
   - Effect: Positions of outer/background components (e.g., Green in train 1/2, aggregate Yellows/Blues in train 3) interact to set the offset, moving inner/attached components (e.g., Oranges in train 2, Blues in train 3) relative to it. Consistent shift observed: train 1 (-6 x, 0 y), train 2 (-6 x, -2 y), train 3 (adjusts scattered to 0-9 grid start).
   - Non-effect: Bottom-placed components (high y >15) have no position interaction with mains—they are excluded from transformation consistently.

5. **Central component position → Relative placement of surrounding components**:
   - The prominent central component (identified by mid-grid bbox in input, e.g., Pink in 1, Yellow in 2, Red in 3) has its position transformed to a fixed approximate center start ([4,4] in output grid).
   - Effect: Interacts with surrounding components' positions by defining relative offsets (e.g., surrounds like Maroon/Oranges/Blues move around it post-translation; Yellow fill in train 3 repositions relative to Red/Blues). Bbox dimensions preserved, but exact relative shifts consistent (centrics anchor the structure).
   - Unknown: Specific trigger for "central" identification (color varies; possibly pixels or overlap, but not explainable from lists alone).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., no uniform hole → color effect, no edges/silhouettes data available, no position → color changes). Bottom small components (e.g., p=1/2 singles at high y) show no interactions and are irrelevant to transformations in every example.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 12:10:34] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train examples, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** puzzle (train inputs 1, 2, and 3). Only properties/components with clear, consistent effects or links are included—no forced or inconsistent ones (e.g., no assumptions about rotation mechanics, as they are not uniformly explainable; hole counts are preserved but do not consistently affect other properties like position across all). Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., isolated bottom-placed small components with no transformation link) are excluded. Unknowns are noted where a connection exists but the exact effect cannot be explained without solving.

1. **Color → Preservation and grouping for transformation**:
   - Shape color is preserved for every corresponding component between input and output.
   - Components of the same color are grouped and transformed together (e.g., all Greens in train 1 and 2 translate as a set; all Yellows in train 2 and 3 are repositioned relative to non-Yellows; all Maroons/Blues/Reds maintain color-specific placements).
   - Effect: Color determines which components move as interacting units (rigid or relative repositioning), consistent across all—no color changes or mixing.

2. **Pixels (area count) → Preservation across all components**:
   - Pixel count for each individual component is identical in input and output for all transformed elements.
   - Effect: Interacts with color and holes to identify matching components (e.g., unique pixel values like 48 for Green in train 1, 6 for Yellow in train 2, 4 for Red in train 3 link input-output pairs directly).
   - Consistent: No pixel changes or mergers/splits observed in any example.

3. **Holes → Preservation, with potential link to central positioning (unknown effect)**:
   - Hole count (0 or 1) is preserved for every corresponding component.
   - Effect: Appears to interact with position for "central" components (e.g., hole=1 components like Green/Pink in train 1 are centered in output bbox; hole=0 centrals like Yellow in train 2 and Red in train 3 follow similar centering). However, the exact way holes affect movement or attachment is unknown, as it does not uniformly trigger changes across examples (absent in train 2 and 3 for mains).

4. **Position (bbox coordinates) → Translation offset from aggregate min position**:
   - Bbox min_x and min_y across all main (non-bottom) components determine a uniform translation offset applied to most components' positions (e.g., subtract min_x from all x, min_y from all y to align overall to [0,0]).
   - Effect: Positions of outer/background components (e.g., Green in train 1/2, aggregate Yellows/Blues in train 3) interact to set the offset, moving inner/attached components (e.g., Oranges in train 2, Blues in train 3) relative to it. Consistent shift observed: train 1 (-6 x, 0 y), train 2 (-6 x, -2 y), train 3 (adjusts scattered to 0-9 grid start).
   - Non-effect: Bottom-placed components (high y >15) have no position interaction with mains—they are excluded from transformation consistently.

5. **Central component position → Relative placement of surrounding components**:
   - The prominent central component (identified by mid-grid bbox in input, e.g., Pink in 1, Yellow in 2, Red in 3) has its position transformed to a fixed approximate center start ([4,4] in output grid).
   - Effect: Interacts with surrounding components' positions by defining relative offsets (e.g., surrounds like Maroon/Oranges/Blues move around it post-translation; Yellow fill in train 3 repositions relative to Red/Blues). Bbox dimensions preserved, but exact relative shifts consistent (centrics anchor the structure).
   - Unknown: Specific trigger for "central" identification (color varies; possibly pixels or overlap, but not explainable from lists alone).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., no uniform hole → color effect, no edges/silhouettes data available, no position → color changes). Bottom small components (e.g., p=1/2 singles at high y) show no interactions and are irrelevant to transformations in every example.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 12:20:23] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 12:21:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop and normalize a larger input grid (likely 20x20 with non-zero elements forming visual "objects" or patterns in the top portion) into the smallest possible square grid that tightly bounds all non-zero cells, by shifting the content to start at position (0,0) and padding the rest with zeros to make it square (using the maximum of the bounding height and width as the side length). The output preserves the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but eliminates empty space around the edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids appear to be 20x20, but non-zero content is confined to the top ~16 rows (rows 0-15), with rows 16-19 likely being empty or irrelevant (e.g., a footer or padding); however, hardcoding "i < 16" in min/max calculations risks excluding valid content if it spills over or if the rule is more flexible.
 * Compute the bounding box by finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices with any non-zero value; height = max_r - min_r + 1, width = max_c - min_c + 1; side length s = max(height, width) to ensure a square output.
 * Shift all non-zero cells by subtracting min_r from their row index and min_c from their column index, placing them in a new s x s grid starting at (0,0); any cells that would fall outside after shifting are discarded (though this hasn't occurred in examples).
 * Outputs are printed as lists of integers (one per row), with the number of lists indicating the grid height (which should equal s); all outputs must be square, but the provided generated outputs vary in size and include unnecessary empty rows/columns.
 * Subtlety: Disconnected components or scattered non-zeros (e.g., in train3, there are separate 1's, 4's, and 2's) must all be included in the single bounding box—no extraction of individual "objects"; the entire non-zero content is treated as one unit.
 * Easy to miss: Padding must be zeros only outside the shifted bounding box; do not alter values or introduce new non-zeros; if the bounding box is empty or all zeros, output a 0x0 or minimal grid, but examples have content.
 * Grids may have irregular shapes (e.g., train1 has a frame-like 3's with internal 8's, 6's; train2 has nested shapes with 5's as borders), so min/max must scan every cell accurately without assuming connectivity.
 * Outputs in examples are rectangular in print but should represent square grids (e.g., train2 expected is 10x10, but printed as 10 lists of 10 ints); ensure no trailing empty rows/columns in the final grid.
 * The program ignores rows >=16 entirely in min/max, which works if content is always top-heavy but fails if not; also, if min_r ==20 (all empty in top 16), it returns 0, which may pad incorrectly.
 * No rotation, scaling, or value changes—just translation to top-left and squaring.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions for finding min/max row/col and shifting are conceptually useful but buggy (e.g., hardcoded i<16 limits scanning; compute_size is correct but simplistic; shift_and_place discards out-of-bounds but doesn't handle empty cases well). Here's a refined version without the row limit, using full 20x20 scan:

```python
from typing import List

def find_min_r(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    min_r = len(g)  # Assume 20
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, i)
                break  # Optimize: once row has non-zero, it's min
    return min_r if min_r < len(g) else 0  # 0 if empty?

def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    max_r = -1
    for i in range(len(g) - 1, -1, -1):  # Scan from bottom for efficiency
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                max_r = i
                break
    return max_r if max_r >= 0 else 0

# Similar for find_min_c and find_max_c, scanning columns fully without i<16 limit

def compute_size(h: int, w: int) -> int:
    return max(h, w) if h > 0 and w > 0 else 0  # Handle empty case

def create_empty_grid(s: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[0] * s for _ in range(s)] if s > 0 else []

def shift_and_place(g: List[List[int]], new_grid: List[List[int]], min_r: int, min_c: int, s: int) -> None:
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                ni = i - min_r
                nj = j - min_c
                if 0 <= ni < s and 0 <= nj < s:
                    new_grid[ni][nj] = g[i][j]
```

No types like PuzzleElement are needed; simple grid ops suffice. Function to extract all non-zero positions could help verify bounding box:

```python
def get_nonzero_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    positions = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                positions.append((i, j))
    return positions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a bounding box approach but hardcoded row scans to i<16, which excluded potential content below row 15 and led to incorrect min_r/max_r in cases with bottom content (though examples seem top-confined, it still failed due to sizing/shifting bugs).
 * What worked: Shifting logic in shift_and_place correctly translates cells relative to min_r/min_c; compute_size correctly makes square by max(h,w); it identified non-zeros and avoided overwriting.
 * What didn't work: Hardcoded i<16 in all find_* functions ignored rows 16-19, but even if content is there, it caused oversized s (e.g., if min_r=0, h=16ish, s large); returned 0 for empty scans but didn't handle s=0 properly, leading to empty or mismatched grids.
 * Train1: Generated a ~13x13 grid but misplaced elements—e.g., row0 has [0,0,3,0,3,...] (two 3's too early) vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] (single 3 later); internal 8's and 6's shifted wrong, with extra 3's in row2 and missing shifts in lower rows; overall, bounding box too loose, including phantom space on left/top.
 * Train2: Generated ~15x15 with lots of empty rows/columns (e.g., many leading/trailing 0's per row, and empty rows at bottom); expected is tight 10x10—e.g., generated row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,...] has scattered 5's not shifted to tight bound, while expected starts with [5,0,5,...] packed left; 3's and 4's misaligned, with extra padding.
 * Train3: Generated ~14x14 with excessive empties (e.g., many all-zero rows at top/middle); expected 10x10 tight—e.g., generated has isolated 1's and 4's spread out (row0 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,...] vs expected starting directly with [0,4,0,4,...]); alternating 4's not packed, 2's blob shifted incorrectly, leading to loose bounds.
 * No object extraction function was used or needed; the attempt treated the whole grid as one, which is correct, but didn't verify with something like get_nonzero_positions to debug bounds.
 * Function find_min_r etc. are helpful but broken due to i<16—remove limit; shift_and_place is useful but should check for empty input (s=0) to return empty list.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The hardcoded row limit makes all scans incomplete; compute_size returns max even if h=0, potentially giving s=w but wrong if empty; no handling for non-square inputs leading to oversized outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it generates a nearly full 19x19 grid (19 rows listed, many with 19 elements) filled mostly with zeros and scattered non-zeros (e.g., 5's in columns 3-4 early on, 3's at bottom-left, 4 in row12 col12), but fails to tightly bound or shift: e.g., non-zeros span from row2 (3's) to row15 (3's), columns 2-18, but output includes huge empty top/left/right/bottom padding instead of cropping to ~14x17 then squaring to 17x17 and shifting everything to top-left.
 * It looks incorrect because the bounding box isn't computed tightly (likely due to i<16 including too much empty space above/below, or wrong min_r=0 assuming full height); shifted positions are off—e.g., the cluster of 3's/5's/4 in rows10-15 cols9-18 should pack to row0 col0 start, but remains offset; extra empty rows (e.g., rows5-6,8-9 all zeros) bloat the size unnecessarily.
 * Does not make sense: Expected should be a compact square (s~10-14 based on visible clusters: vertical 5's early, horizontal 3's/5's bottom), with all non-zeros contiguous from (0,0), no scattered empties inside bounds; this output retains input layout too closely without proper crop/shift, suggesting the i<16 bug or full-grid scan without true min/max.

[2025-10-03 12:21:26] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 12:41:57] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels or labeled regions in a visual drawing) to isolate and output a cropped, centered, and square-padded version of the primary "object" or content, excluding backgrounds, frames, or extraneous elements. The goal appears to be tight bounding box cropping around the meaningful visual element, followed by padding to a square, but the exact definition of the "primary object" (e.g., excluding connected borders or frames) is key to matching expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids contain numbers like 0 (background), 3 (possibly a frame or border color), 4/5/6/8 (object colors), and the output must preserve these values exactly while adjusting positions via cropping/padding.
 * Connected components are 8-directional (including diagonals), which is correctly implemented, but the "largest" component may include unwanted frames (e.g., surrounding 3's in train1 and test), leading to overly broad bounding boxes that shift or include extra elements.
 * Cropping must be precise to the minimal bounding box of the intended object; padding centers the cropped content in a square of side max(height, width) of the crop, with 0's filling edges, but misalignment occurs if the bbox is wrong (e.g., generated outputs shift rows/columns relative to expected).
 * Subtle elements: Outer frames (e.g., 3's in train1/test) seem treated as background to exclude, not part of the object; multiple components exist (e.g., separate blobs of 4/6/8), so largest-by-size may grab the frame instead of the inner drawing. In train2/3, rotations or symmetries in borders (5's/4's) suggest excluding perimeter patterns. Padding must not introduce asymmetries; expected outputs often have irregular padding (e.g., more 0's on one side).
 * All non-zero cells aren't always the object—likely need to ignore border-like structures (e.g., full rows/columns of same number). Outputs are always square-padded but dimensions vary (13x13 for train1, 10x10 for train2/3, 7x7 for test).
 * Easy to miss: Component size counts cells, but frames may be larger; bbox updates must track min/max accurately during flood-fill. No rotation or flipping seems needed, but symmetries in inputs (e.g., test's H-like 3's with inner 4) imply symmetric cropping.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes largest component is the target, which fails; need to perhaps find bbox of all non-zero or subtract frame. Outputs must match expected exactly, including 0 placements—no tolerance for shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_largest_component_bbox(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    # (as provided: flood-fills 8-connected components to find largest by cell count, tracks bbox)
    # Helpful for identifying connected regions, but flawed as it grabs frames; could modify to skip border-connected or find second-largest.
    pass

def crop_and_pad(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (as provided: extracts subgrid to bbox, pads to square with 0's in top-left alignment)
    # Core logic is sound for post-bbox processing; ensures square output. Subtle issue: assumes input indices valid, but works if bbox correct. Helpful for final formatting.
    pass
```
```python
# No other functions in attempt; could add:
def find_all_nonzero_bbox(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    # Alternative: min/max over all non-zero cells (ignores connectivity); might capture full content without component bias.
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = rows, 0, cols, 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, r)
                max_r = max(max_r, r)
                min_c = min(min_c, c)
                max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c if min_r <= max_r else (0, 0, 0, 0)
```
* No unhelpful/broken functions in attempt; the provided ones are relevant but insufficient alone (e.g., find_largest_component_bbox grabs wrong region).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Single attempt shown: All three training examples failed due to incorrect bbox selection, leading to shifted or inclusive cropping that mismatches expected positions and includes/excludes wrong elements.
 * Train1: Generated crops to a 13x13 square including a full 3's frame and inner elements, but bbox starts too left/early (e.g., row1 has 3 at col3 and col5, vs expected's 3's at col4 and col11; row3 has 8's starting col3 vs expected col4; overall, generated includes extra top-left 3's and misaligns bottom rows like row10 having 8's where expected has 0's). What worked: Correctly identifies connected 3/8/6 regions and pads to square. What didn't: Largest component is the 3's frame (connected around edges), bloating bbox and shifting content right/down vs expected (which seems to crop tighter around inner 8/6 with partial 3's).
 * Train2: Generated 10x10 crops include 5's border and inner 3/4, but misaligns (e.g., row2 has 3's starting col4 vs expected row2 all 0's except col7=3; row4 has 3's at col2/3 and 4 at col5/6 vs expected row4 3's at col3 and 4's shifted right; includes extra 5's on right). What worked: Padding logic centers roughly. What didn't: Grabs 5's frame as part of largest component, causing vertical/horizontal shifts; expected excludes some 0-rows and adjusts for inner 3/4 blob, possibly treating 5's as background.
 * Train3: Generated 10x10 includes 4's border and inner 1/2, but rotates or shifts borders (e.g., row1 starts with 4,0,4,... vs expected row1 0,4,0,...; row3 has 1 at col4 vs expected row3 1's at col4/5 but different 0 placements; overall, generated seems to crop from a different origin, including extra 4's on edges). What worked: 8-connected flood-fill correctly groups 1/2/4. What didn't: Largest component includes perimeter 4's (alternating pattern), leading to bbox that flips or misaligns symmetries; expected tightens to inner 1/2 with minimal border, suggesting frame exclusion.
 * General: Attempt understands connected components and bbox/padding, but misses that frames (3/5/4 borders) are not the "object"—need to detect/exclude them (e.g., via perimeter check or non-largest component). No extraction of "objects" beyond largest; could add frame detection. Unknown why shifts occur exactly (possibly bbox min_r/min_c off by 1-2 due to frame inclusion).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (7x7) does not look correct: It crops to include the full 3's frame (forming an H or window shape) with inner 4, but bbox seems too broad/left-aligned (e.g., row1 [0,0,3,3,0,0,0] includes left 3's cluster; row7 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0] has bottom-right 3 isolated). Expected likely tighter around the central 4 and symmetric 3's arms, excluding outer 0's or frame edges—e.g., should center the 4 at ~row4/col4 with balanced 3's padding, matching train patterns where frames are partially omitted/shifted (e.g., more 0's on sides, no full border inclusion). This fails similarly to trainings by treating the 3's frame as the primary component; to fix, exclude perimeter-connected 3's or use overall non-zero bbox for tighter fit.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 12:42:14] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 12:46:51] Response:
- **Preservation of individual properties across all examples**: Every element's color, hole count, and pixel count is preserved in the output for corresponding elements (no changes to these intrinsic properties; any removals are of outliers only, consistent in trains 1 and 3, with none in train 2).
- **Global translation of main cluster to top-left (0,0)**: In every example, the main group of overlapping or adjacent elements (defined by bbox proximity or containment) is translated such that the minimum x and minimum y of the group becomes 0, preserving relative positions within the group (e.g., train 1: -6x/0y shift for Green/Pink/big Maroon; train 2: -6x/-2y shift for most Oranges/Greens; train 3: variable per subgroup but overall mins to 0 for Yellow/Blue/Red clusters).
- **Position of small elements (pixels ≤ 6, often standalone squares) affected by larger/adjacent elements**: Small elements interact with nearby larger or framing elements by having their positions relocated relative to them after the main shift (consistent relocation, not random; e.g., train 1: small Maroon (p=3) moved from top-left adjacency to big Maroon to bottom-right relative position within shifted big Maroon bbox; train 2: Yellow (p=6) repositioned to center gap between adjacent Greens, preserving gap-based proximity; train 3: small Yellows (p=1) repositioned around Blue/Red bboxes to form consistent filler pattern relative to their input proximities).
- **Containment/adjacency affects relative positioning**: Elements whose input bboxes overlap or are adjacent (e.g., Pink inside Green in train 1; Yellow between Greens in train 2; Yellows near Blues in train 3) maintain or adjust relative positions in output based on the containing/framing element's new position (no absolute positions preserved, but relational; e.g., central elements like Pink/Yellow stay centrally relative to containers).
- **Outlier removal (position-based)**: Elements far from the main cluster (high/low bbox values relative to group min/max, e.g., >2 units beyond group extent) are consistently removed and not present in output (train 1: small elements at y=16-18; train 3: Yellow at x=14; none in train 2 as all within cluster).
- **Unknown: Exact relocation rule for small elements within main cluster**: While small elements consistently interact with larger ones via relative repositioning (e.g., to centers, corners, or gaps), the precise transformation (e.g., flip in train 1, centering in train 2, pattern-filling in train 3) cannot be explained as a single consistent mechanism across all without forcing unrelated patterns; appears influenced by shape properties (e.g., L-shaped Greens affecting Yellow gaps) but not uniform.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 12:46:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract or crop a subgrid from a larger input grid (likely square, with dimensions around 10-13 based on examples) that captures the "core" or primary patterned object(s) formed by non-zero numbers, while excluding border padding, empty rows/columns, or extraneous elements. The output should be a rectangular or square subgrid that matches the expected structure exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of the numbers (which seem to represent colors, labels, or connected components like blobs/shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid contains non-zero numbers (e.g., 3,8,6 in train1; 5,3,4 in train2; 4,1,2 in train3) arranged in patterns that likely form distinct "objects" or shapes, surrounded by zeros acting as background or padding; the task is to isolate the bounding box of the main object(s), but not just any dense area—subtleties include handling irregular shapes, multiple components, and ensuring the crop aligns precisely with the expected layout (e.g., including specific zero placements within the object).
 * Outputs must match the expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected is 13 rows x 13 columns, but generated is 12x12; train2 expected 10x10, generated 10x10 but content wrong; train3 expected 10x10 with rotated/shifted elements, generated 9x9?); mismatches in size indicate failure to detect the correct span or padding.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have "borders" or frames (e.g., 3's outlining in train1, 5's in train2/train3), internal zeros that are part of the shape (not to be cropped out), and asymmetric placements (e.g., objects not centered, with uneven padding); vertical and horizontal cropping must consider the minimal bounding box that includes all relevant non-zeros without trimming internal structure.
 * Connected components or spans: Non-zeros form blobs (e.g., 8's as one shape, 6's as another in train1), and the crop should encompass the largest or primary blob(s); however, it's not just max span—expected outputs shift or select specific alignments (e.g., train1 expected starts columns later, includes extra row/column with sparse 3's).
 * Padding and zeros: Expected outputs retain some outer zeros if they are part of the frame (e.g., train1 expected has leading/trailing zeros in rows), but exclude large empty borders; generated outputs often over-crop or misalign, removing necessary zeros or adding incorrect padding.
 * Multiple objects: Grids may have hierarchical or adjacent shapes (e.g., train1 has 3-frame around 8/6 innards; train2 has 5-frame with internal 3/4; train3 has 4-frame with internal 1/2), requiring the crop to include the enclosing frame without fragmenting internals.
 * Vertical selection: Not all rows with max horizontal span are equal; expected selects a contiguous block but shifted (e.g., train1 generated starts at row 1, expected includes row 0 and 12 with sparse elements).
 * Horizontal alignment: Left edge is not always the global min column; it must align to the frame's start (e.g., train1 generated left=1 based on min_first, but expected left=3 with more leading zeros).
 * Density vs. structure: Summing non-zero counts for vertical selection works partially but fails when multiple candidate blocks have similar sums; expected prioritizes structural integrity over max density.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero rows/columns in output only if they frame the object (e.g., train3 expected has patterned borders); test input has scattered 5/3/4 patterns, likely needing a crop that captures a central cross-like or framed shape.
 * Overall: The puzzle emphasizes exact reproduction of the "visible" core image, possibly from a larger canvas with margins; failures often stem from incorrect bounding box calculation, ignoring frame elements, or wrong vertical/horizontal slicing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes some potentially useful primitives for analysis, but they are flawed in application.

```python
from typing import List

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is helpful for measuring row density, useful for vertical block selection, but insufficient alone as it ignores column-wise or structural alignment.)

```python
def get_span(row: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    first = None
    for i in range(n):
        if row[i] != 0:
            first = i
            break
    if first is None:
        return 0
    last = None
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if row[i] != 0:
            last = i
            break
    return last - first + 1 if last is not None else 0
```
(This computes the width of the non-zero segment in a row, helpful for identifying max pattern size horizontally, but misses multi-segment rows or frame detection; could be extended for column spans.)

No other types or tools are provided; future attempts might benefit from functions to find bounding boxes (min/max row/col with non-zeros), detect connected components (e.g., flood fill for blobs), or compute minimal enclosing rectangle for specific values (e.g., trace 3-frames).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt provided, which attempts a cropping strategy based on max horizontal spans and vertical density sums, but all training examples fail due to dimensional mismatches (e.g., train1 generated 12x12 vs. expected 13x13) and content errors (e.g., wrong left alignment, missing sparse frame rows).
 * Worked partially: Horizontal span detection identifies a reasonable size (e.g., captures width of main patterns), and vertical density sum selects a dense block (e.g., train1 generated includes core 8/6 rows 2-10, which overlap expected).
 * Did not work: Over-relies on max span rows for left alignment (e.g., train1 min_first=1 from row1's 3, but expected left=3 to include more padding and align frame); vertical selection picks wrong start (e.g., train1 best_start=1, skipping row0's sparse 3's and excluding row12); adds incorrect padding in rows (e.g., train1 generated pads short rows with zeros on right, but expected has exact 13 cols without padding); ignores overall grid symmetry or frame tracing.
 * Train1: Generated shifts left edge too far left (starts at col1 with 0,0,3 vs. expected col3 with 0,0,0,3), includes wrong row block (rows1-12, missing top/bottom sparse rows, extra dense row10 that's not in expected block), and trims to 12 cols (loses right 3's); differences include misplaced 8's/6's (e.g., generated row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs. expected row2: [0,3,0,8,0,8,...])—unknown why exact positions mismatch, possibly due to wrong left/right calc.
 * Train2: Generated has correct 10x10 size but wrong content (e.g., row3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—generated fills internal zeros incorrectly, shifts 3's/4's leftward); includes row1 as [0,0,0,3,...] but expected has it as empty-ish [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]; vertical block starts too early, capturing wrong frame alignment.
 * Train3: Generated appears 9x9 (rows listed as 9, but code aims for size=9?), with shifted borders (e.g., row0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] vs. expected row9: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—seems rotated or flipped incorrectly); internal 1/2 placements wrong (e.g., row4: [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4] vs. expected row4: [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—generated adds extra leading 4's, loses padding); function get_span likely picks wrong max_s (9 vs. expected 10, trimming borders).
 * The core program(g) function is broken for dimension handling (assumes square crop of max_s, pads incorrectly, selects suboptimal vertical block); count_nonzeros and get_span are helpful but not sufficient—need better bounding box or frame detection; avoid overusing density sums without structural checks, as it leads to dense-but-misaligned crops.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears malformed/incomplete for the puzzle: it has 13 rows but varying lengths (some 13 elems, but structure is ragged); includes large empty rows (e.g., row2 all zeros, row10 all zeros), which likely shouldn't be in a core crop unless framing, but here they disrupt the pattern; the visible parts show a scattered 5/3/4 arrangement (e.g., row4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] seems like a horizontal bar, row6: [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] with a 4 insert), but it's vertically spread with empties, suggesting wrong vertical block selection (probably picked a non-contiguous or padded block including borders).
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Assuming test input has a central framed object with 5's as outer, 3's/4's inner (based on scattered non-zeros around center), expected should be a tight ~9-11x13 crop centering the cross/bar patterns without full empty rows (e.g., exclude top/bottom empties, align left to first 5/3 col ~4, right to last ~12); generated includes too many leading/trailing zeros per row and wrong row selection (e.g., starts with sparse row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0], but likely expected skips to denser block starting row4); it fails to capture a cohesive shape, outputting a "smeared" version with isolated elements—does not make sense as a core extraction, missing subtle frame alignment (e.g., 5's not properly bordering 3/4's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely binary or simple numeric grids representing shapes or objects), where the goal is to identify and extract the "main" contiguous block or object (defined by non-zero cells), crop it to its minimal bounding box, and then pad it symmetrically to form a square grid of appropriate size, preserving the object's structure for further puzzle-solving or recognition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of rows of integers (likely 0s for empty space and non-zero values like 1s for filled cells in an object or shape).
 * Identify the "main block" by finding the row with the highest density of non-zero cells, then extend contiguously up and down to include all adjacent non-zero rows, assuming the object is a single connected vertical block without gaps.
 * After selecting rows, compute the tightest column bounds across those rows by finding the global min/first non-zero column and max/last non-zero column, ignoring fully zero rows or columns.
 * Crop to the bounding box (subgrid of selected rows and columns), then pad with zeros to make it square: first pad columns to match the max of height/width, centering the content; then pad rows similarly if needed.
 * Edge cases include empty grids (return a single [[0]] or similar minimal square), grids where the object doesn't span all columns/rows, or where non-zero counts are zero (handle gracefully without errors).
 * Subtlety: Padding must be centered (equal or floor/ceil split on both sides) to maintain visual symmetry, and the final size should be the max of the cropped height/width, not hardcoded.
 * Assume the grid is rectangular (all rows same length), but the object may not fill the entire grid—avoid including sparse or disconnected parts.
 * Non-zero cells might vary in value (e.g., different numbers for shading), but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding and cropping.
 * Potential for multiple objects: The code assumes one main block via max density row, but puzzles might require selecting the largest/densest without merging disconnected components.

These functions handle row density calculation, block selection, per-row bounds, cropping, and centered padding effectively, and can be reused or minimally fixed for future attempts.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Compute global min first and max last over selected rows."""
    min_c = len(bounds[0][0]) if bounds else 0  # Use a large number  # BROKEN: bounds[0][0] is int, len(int) errors
    max_c = -1

        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
This function is broken due to attempting len() on an int (should initialize min_c to a large value like len(g[0]) instead of len(bounds[0][0])), causing runtime errors on all inputs; it cannot be used as-is and needs fixing to compute column bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the core logic of finding a dense contiguous row block via non-zero counts and extending boundaries, which aligns with extracting a main object.
 * Row and column bound calculation (via get_row_bounds) works in principle for tight cropping, and padding functions ensure centered square output, which seems essential for visual puzzles.
 * However, the entire program fails to execute due to a bug in compute_col_bounds (len() on int), producing errors instead of grids for all cases—nothing "works" in terms of runnable output.
 * Block selection assumes vertical contiguity without gaps, which may miss horizontal-only or disconnected objects, but it's a reasonable start if the puzzle focuses on single blobs.
 * Cropping and padding are applied in the right order (columns first, then rows), but untested due to the crash.
 * No extraction of multiple objects or handling of varying non-zero values beyond binary count; assumes one main block, which might overlook puzzles with noise or multiple components.
 * The main function handles empty grids minimally, but the error prevents verification.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of cropping/padding to square but zero progress on execution, as all attempts (this one) crash identically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or produce a valid grid—it indicates a runtime failure rather than an incorrect but runnable result.
 * No actual grid is generated, so it cannot match any expected cropped/padded square for the test input; the error occurs early in compute_col_bounds, preventing any output.
 * This differs from expectations (a padded square grid representing the main object) because the code crashes instead of processing the grid; likely the test input has a valid non-empty grid, but the bug blocks all progress.
 * Without seeing the test grid, the error suggests the code isn't robust to standard inputs (e.g., non-empty bounds tuples), and future fixes must ensure no type mismatches to handle the test case properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop and normalize a larger input grid (likely 20x20 with non-zero elements forming visual "objects" or patterns in the top portion) into the smallest possible square grid that tightly bounds all non-zero cells, by shifting the content to start at position (0,0) and padding the rest with zeros to make it square (using the maximum of the bounding height and width as the side length). The output preserves the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but eliminates empty space around the edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids appear to be 20x20, but non-zero content is confined to the top ~16 rows (rows 0-15), with rows 16-19 likely being empty or irrelevant (e.g., a footer or padding); however, hardcoding "i < 16" in min/max calculations risks excluding valid content if it spills over or if the rule is more flexible.
 * Compute the bounding box by finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices with any non-zero value; height = max_r - min_r + 1, width = max_c - min_c + 1; side length s = max(height, width) to ensure a square output.
 * Shift all non-zero cells by subtracting min_r from their row index and min_c from their column index, placing them in a new s x s grid starting at (0,0); any cells that would fall outside after shifting are discarded (though this hasn't occurred in examples).
 * Outputs are printed as lists of integers (one per row), with the number of lists indicating the grid height (which should equal s); all outputs must be square, but the provided generated outputs vary in size and include unnecessary empty rows/columns.
 * Subtlety: Disconnected components or scattered non-zeros (e.g., in train3, there are separate 1's, 4's, and 2's) must all be included in the single bounding box—no extraction of individual "objects"; the entire non-zero content is treated as one unit.
 * Easy to miss: Padding must be zeros only outside the shifted bounding box; do not alter values or introduce new non-zeros; if the bounding box is empty or all zeros, output a 0x0 or minimal grid, but examples have content.
 * Grids may have irregular shapes (e.g., train1 has a frame-like 3's with internal 8's, 6's; train2 has nested shapes with 5's as borders), so min/max must scan every cell accurately without assuming connectivity.
 * Outputs in examples are rectangular in print but should represent square grids (e.g., train2 expected is 10x10, but printed as 10 lists of 10 ints); ensure no trailing empty rows/columns in the final grid.
 * The program ignores rows >=16 entirely in min/max, which works if content is always top-heavy but fails if not; also, if min_r ==20 (all empty in top 16), it returns 0, which may pad incorrectly.
 * No rotation, scaling, or value changes—just translation to top-left and squaring.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions for finding min/max row/col and shifting are conceptually useful but buggy (e.g., hardcoded i<16 limits scanning; compute_size is correct but simplistic; shift_and_place discards out-of-bounds but doesn't handle empty cases well). Here's a refined version without the row limit, using full 20x20 scan:

```python
from typing import List

def find_min_r(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    min_r = len(g)  # Assume 20
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, i)
                break  # Optimize: once row has non-zero, it's min
    return min_r if min_r < len(g) else 0  # 0 if empty?

def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    max_r = -1
    for i in range(len(g) - 1, -1, -1):  # Scan from bottom for efficiency
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                max_r = i
                break
    return max_r if max_r >= 0 else 0

# Similar for find_min_c and find_max_c, scanning columns fully without i<16 limit

def compute_size(h: int, w: int) -> int:
    return max(h, w) if h > 0 and w > 0 else 0  # Handle empty case

def create_empty_grid(s: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[0] * s for _ in range(s)] if s > 0 else []

def shift_and_place(g: List[List[int]], new_grid: List[List[int]], min_r: int, min_c: int, s: int) -> None:
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                ni = i - min_r
                nj = j - min_c
                if 0 <= ni < s and 0 <= nj < s:
                    new_grid[ni][nj] = g[i][j]
```

No types like PuzzleElement are needed; simple grid ops suffice. Function to extract all non-zero positions could help verify bounding box:

```python
def get_nonzero_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    positions = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                positions.append((i, j))
    return positions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a bounding box approach but hardcoded row scans to i<16, which excluded potential content below row 15 and led to incorrect min_r/max_r in cases with bottom content (though examples seem top-confined, it still failed due to sizing/shifting bugs).
 * What worked: Shifting logic in shift_and_place correctly translates cells relative to min_r/min_c; compute_size correctly makes square by max(h,w); it identified non-zeros and avoided overwriting.
 * What didn't work: Hardcoded i<16 in all find_* functions ignored rows 16-19, but even if content is there, it caused oversized s (e.g., if min_r=0, h=16ish, s large); returned 0 for empty scans but didn't handle s=0 properly, leading to empty or mismatched grids.
 * Train1: Generated a ~13x13 grid but misplaced elements—e.g., row0 has [0,0,3,0,3,...] (two 3's too early) vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] (single 3 later); internal 8's and 6's shifted wrong, with extra 3's in row2 and missing shifts in lower rows; overall, bounding box too loose, including phantom space on left/top.
 * Train2: Generated ~15x15 with lots of empty rows/columns (e.g., many leading/trailing 0's per row, and empty rows at bottom); expected is tight 10x10—e.g., generated row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,...] has scattered 5's not shifted to tight bound, while expected starts with [5,0,5,...] packed left; 3's and 4's misaligned, with extra padding.
 * Train3: Generated ~14x14 with excessive empties (e.g., many all-zero rows at top/middle); expected 10x10 tight—e.g., generated has isolated 1's and 4's spread out (row0 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,...] vs expected starting directly with [0,4,0,4,...]); alternating 4's not packed, 2's blob shifted incorrectly, leading to loose bounds.
 * No object extraction function was used or needed; the attempt treated the whole grid as one, which is correct, but didn't verify with something like get_nonzero_positions to debug bounds.
 * Function find_min_r etc. are helpful but broken due to i<16—remove limit; shift_and_place is useful but should check for empty input (s=0) to return empty list.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The hardcoded row limit makes all scans incomplete; compute_size returns max even if h=0, potentially giving s=w but wrong if empty; no handling for non-square inputs leading to oversized outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it generates a nearly full 19x19 grid (19 rows listed, many with 19 elements) filled mostly with zeros and scattered non-zeros (e.g., 5's in columns 3-4 early on, 3's at bottom-left, 4 in row12 col12), but fails to tightly bound or shift: e.g., non-zeros span from row2 (3's) to row15 (3's), columns 2-18, but output includes huge empty top/left/right/bottom padding instead of cropping to ~14x17 then squaring to 17x17 and shifting everything to top-left.
 * It looks incorrect because the bounding box isn't computed tightly (likely due to i<16 including too much empty space above/below, or wrong min_r=0 assuming full height); shifted positions are off—e.g., the cluster of 3's/5's/4 in rows10-15 cols9-18 should pack to row0 col0 start, but remains offset; extra empty rows (e.g., rows5-6,8-9 all zeros) bloat the size unnecessarily.
 * Does not make sense: Expected should be a compact square (s~10-14 based on visible clusters: vertical 5's early, horizontal 3's/5's bottom), with all non-zeros contiguous from (0,0), no scattered empties inside bounds; this output retains input layout too closely without proper crop/shift, suggesting the i<16 bug or full-grid scan without true min/max.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels or labeled regions in a visual drawing) to isolate and output a cropped, centered, and square-padded version of the primary "object" or content, excluding backgrounds, frames, or extraneous elements. The goal appears to be tight bounding box cropping around the meaningful visual element, followed by padding to a square, but the exact definition of the "primary object" (e.g., excluding connected borders or frames) is key to matching expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids contain numbers like 0 (background), 3 (possibly a frame or border color), 4/5/6/8 (object colors), and the output must preserve these values exactly while adjusting positions via cropping/padding.
 * Connected components are 8-directional (including diagonals), which is correctly implemented, but the "largest" component may include unwanted frames (e.g., surrounding 3's in train1 and test), leading to overly broad bounding boxes that shift or include extra elements.
 * Cropping must be precise to the minimal bounding box of the intended object; padding centers the cropped content in a square of side max(height, width) of the crop, with 0's filling edges, but misalignment occurs if the bbox is wrong (e.g., generated outputs shift rows/columns relative to expected).
 * Subtle elements: Outer frames (e.g., 3's in train1/test) seem treated as background to exclude, not part of the object; multiple components exist (e.g., separate blobs of 4/6/8), so largest-by-size may grab the frame instead of the inner drawing. In train2/3, rotations or symmetries in borders (5's/4's) suggest excluding perimeter patterns. Padding must not introduce asymmetries; expected outputs often have irregular padding (e.g., more 0's on one side).
 * All non-zero cells aren't always the object—likely need to ignore border-like structures (e.g., full rows/columns of same number). Outputs are always square-padded but dimensions vary (13x13 for train1, 10x10 for train2/3, 7x7 for test).
 * Easy to miss: Component size counts cells, but frames may be larger; bbox updates must track min/max accurately during flood-fill. No rotation or flipping seems needed, but symmetries in inputs (e.g., test's H-like 3's with inner 4) imply symmetric cropping.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes largest component is the target, which fails; need to perhaps find bbox of all non-zero or subtract frame. Outputs must match expected exactly, including 0 placements—no tolerance for shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_largest_component_bbox(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    # (as provided: flood-fills 8-connected components to find largest by cell count, tracks bbox)
    # Helpful for identifying connected regions, but flawed as it grabs frames; could modify to skip border-connected or find second-largest.
    pass

def crop_and_pad(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (as provided: extracts subgrid to bbox, pads to square with 0's in top-left alignment)
    # Core logic is sound for post-bbox processing; ensures square output. Subtle issue: assumes input indices valid, but works if bbox correct. Helpful for final formatting.
    pass
```
```python
# No other functions in attempt; could add:
def find_all_nonzero_bbox(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    # Alternative: min/max over all non-zero cells (ignores connectivity); might capture full content without component bias.
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = rows, 0, cols, 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, r)
                max_r = max(max_r, r)
                min_c = min(min_c, c)
                max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c if min_r <= max_r else (0, 0, 0, 0)
```
* No unhelpful/broken functions in attempt; the provided ones are relevant but insufficient alone (e.g., find_largest_component_bbox grabs wrong region).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Single attempt shown: All three training examples failed due to incorrect bbox selection, leading to shifted or inclusive cropping that mismatches expected positions and includes/excludes wrong elements.
 * Train1: Generated crops to a 13x13 square including a full 3's frame and inner elements, but bbox starts too left/early (e.g., row1 has 3 at col3 and col5, vs expected's 3's at col4 and col11; row3 has 8's starting col3 vs expected col4; overall, generated includes extra top-left 3's and misaligns bottom rows like row10 having 8's where expected has 0's). What worked: Correctly identifies connected 3/8/6 regions and pads to square. What didn't: Largest component is the 3's frame (connected around edges), bloating bbox and shifting content right/down vs expected (which seems to crop tighter around inner 8/6 with partial 3's).
 * Train2: Generated 10x10 crops include 5's border and inner 3/4, but misaligns (e.g., row2 has 3's starting col4 vs expected row2 all 0's except col7=3; row4 has 3's at col2/3 and 4 at col5/6 vs expected row4 3's at col3 and 4's shifted right; includes extra 5's on right). What worked: Padding logic centers roughly. What didn't: Grabs 5's frame as part of largest component, causing vertical/horizontal shifts; expected excludes some 0-rows and adjusts for inner 3/4 blob, possibly treating 5's as background.
 * Train3: Generated 10x10 includes 4's border and inner 1/2, but rotates or shifts borders (e.g., row1 starts with 4,0,4,... vs expected row1 0,4,0,...; row3 has 1 at col4 vs expected row3 1's at col4/5 but different 0 placements; overall, generated seems to crop from a different origin, including extra 4's on edges). What worked: 8-connected flood-fill correctly groups 1/2/4. What didn't: Largest component includes perimeter 4's (alternating pattern), leading to bbox that flips or misaligns symmetries; expected tightens to inner 1/2 with minimal border, suggesting frame exclusion.
 * General: Attempt understands connected components and bbox/padding, but misses that frames (3/5/4 borders) are not the "object"—need to detect/exclude them (e.g., via perimeter check or non-largest component). No extraction of "objects" beyond largest; could add frame detection. Unknown why shifts occur exactly (possibly bbox min_r/min_c off by 1-2 due to frame inclusion).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (7x7) does not look correct: It crops to include the full 3's frame (forming an H or window shape) with inner 4, but bbox seems too broad/left-aligned (e.g., row1 [0,0,3,3,0,0,0] includes left 3's cluster; row7 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0] has bottom-right 3 isolated). Expected likely tighter around the central 4 and symmetric 3's arms, excluding outer 0's or frame edges—e.g., should center the 4 at ~row4/col4 with balanced 3's padding, matching train patterns where frames are partially omitted/shifted (e.g., more 0's on sides, no full border inclusion). This fails similarly to trainings by treating the 3's frame as the primary component; to fix, exclude perimeter-connected 3's or use overall non-zero bbox for tighter fit.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

```
The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with different "colors" or values like 3,6,8) to extract the central or main non-zero content, crop it to a tight bounding box, and pad it symmetrically to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main block" should be identified as the longest consecutive sequence of rows with any non-zero elements, but care must be taken to exclude leading/trailing fully zero rows without including isolated zero rows within the block if they are structurally important (e.g., in example 1, internal zero positions are preserved but the block start/end must align precisely with the expected cropped area).
 * Column bounds must be computed only over the main row block, finding the minimal and maximal non-zero columns across those rows, but without expanding beyond the actual content—subtly, if a row in the block has no non-zeros (but is included in the block due to adjacency), its bounds should not affect min/max (current compute_col_bounds skips if l==-1, which is good, but may still misalign if block includes empty rows incorrectly).
 * Padding to square must be symmetric (centering the content) using zeros, first padding columns to match height, then rows to match the new width, but the target size is max(h,w) after cropping—issue is that if cropping misses parts, padding adds extra zeros in wrong places (e.g., in example 1, generated adds unintended non-zeros or shifts content left/right).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes with borders of zeros; the output should be square but retain the exact relative positions of non-zeros from the cropped area (e.g., example 2 shows misalignment in rows 3-4 where generated has [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] but expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], indicating column crop is too narrow or shifted).
 * Subtle element: Non-zeros represent "pixels" of different types (e.g., 3 might be borders, 6/8 fills), and the puzzle likely requires exact reproduction without altering values or introducing new ones—easy to miss that bounding box must be inclusive of all edge non-zeros but exclusive of outer empty space.
 * In example 3, the pattern alternates rows/columns, and generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips the starting row order, suggesting possible row reversal or reordering not handled (or wrong block detection includes extra).
 * General: Handle empty or all-zero grids by returning [[0]]; assume rectangular input; outputs are lists of lists, printed as rows.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), consider that main block detection uses row non-zero counts correctly but may over-include if zero rows are adjacent (e.g., example 1 generated includes row 0 with partial non-zeros? Wait, generated row 0 [0,0,3,0,3,...] suggests crop started too early or wrong min_c).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(x != 0 for x in row)
```
(This is useful for identifying dense rows.)

```python
def get_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing row densities to find blocks.)

```python
def find_main_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_len = 0
    best_start = 0
    curr_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            len_block = i - curr_start
            if len_block > max_len:
                max_len = len_block
                best_start = curr_start
            curr_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_len - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This identifies the longest run of non-empty rows, which is core but subtly fails if multiple blocks exist or if zeros inside should be included—worked partially for block length but wrong start in examples.)

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row min/max non-zero columns; essential for tight cropping, but only applied to main block rows.)

```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, num_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = num_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l != -1:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
(Combines row bounds for overall column crop; helpful but may yield empty if all rows in block are zero, leading to [[0]] fallback.)

```python
def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row_slice = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row_slice)
    return cropped
```
(Core cropping function; works for slicing but inherits errors from bounds.)

```python
def pad_dimension(lst: List[List[int]], target_size: int, is_rows: bool) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not lst:
        return [[0]]
    current_size = len(lst) if is_rows else len(lst[0])
    if current_size >= target_size:
        return lst
    pad_size = target_size - current_size
    left_or_top = pad_size // 2
    right_or_bottom = pad_size - left_or_top
    if is_rows:
        empty = [0] * len(lst[0])
        for _ in range(left_or_top):
            lst.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(right_or_bottom):
            lst.append(empty[:])
    else:
        for r in range(len(lst)):
            lst[r] = [0] * left_or_top + lst[r] + [0] * right_or_bottom
    return lst
```
(Handles symmetric zero-padding for dimensions; useful and correct in isolation, but applied after faulty crop leads to misaligned content.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    size = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, False)  # pad columns
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, True)   # pad rows
    return cropped
```
(Overall squaring logic; helpful but order matters—padding columns first then rows ensures square, but if w > h initially, row padding adds to height correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the concept of finding a main non-zero block via row counts and cropping to bounding box, which works for isolating content in dense grids but fails on precise start/end (e.g., Train 1 generated starts crop too early, including extraneous left-shifted 3's in row 0 and mismatches like row 2 [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—shifted right by 1 and wrong values at ends; unknown why exact mismatch but likely min_c off by 1).
 * Train 2: Cropping works for row block but column bounds too narrow, omitting right-side elements (generated row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—missing two 3's on right, extra 3 on left); padding adds zeros incorrectly around incomplete crop.
 * Train 3: Block detection includes wrong rows, leading to row order flip or extra borders (generated row 0 [4,0,4,...] vs expected row 0 [0,4,0,...]—seems like it cropped starting from an offset row and didn't reverse or adjust for alternating pattern).
 * find_main_block is helpful but broken for cases with internal zero rows that should be included (it skips on any zero count row, potentially splitting blocks—e.g., if a structural zero row has count=0 but is part of the object, it's excluded).
 * get_row_bounds and compute_col_bounds are essential and mostly correct but fail when block has varying widths, leading to over-tight crops.
 * pad_dimension and pad_to_square are not broken and helpful for final output, but unhelpful if upstream crop is wrong (don't modify, but ensure crop inputs are accurate).
 * Overall, no extraction of "objects" like connected components was attempted, which might be needed if multiple disjoint parts exist (not in this code, but could be relevant for subtleties like ignoring outliers); current approach assumes single main block.
 * Train 1 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., generated row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—extra 3 and wrong positions, likely from faulty end_r or max_c).
 * No function for connected component analysis or object extraction, which might be unhelpful here since the puzzle seems bounding-box based, not segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped a central 5x13-ish pattern (rows ~3-9 with 3's,5's,4's) but padded excessively to 13x13 with large zero borders, shifting the content downward and not centering it properly (e.g., non-zeros start at row 3, but expected likely tighter crop to rows 4-8, columns ~3-10, padded to ~7x7 square embedded in zeros without the wide empty top/bottom). 
 * It includes symmetric 5's on left/right but mismatches internal structure (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] suggests incomplete column crop, missing connections like the 4 in row 6); this doesn't make sense as a clean extraction—likely wrong min_c/max_c (too wide on sides, too narrow vertically) and over-pads without preserving the "object" shape (e.g., the cross-like 3's and inner 4 seem distorted). 
 * To handle test case, account for multiple horizontal bars (top/bottom 5's, middle 3's) by ensuring block includes all connected non-zeros vertically, even if sparse; current code probably picks a partial block, leading to missing top/bottom elements.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid processing, where the goal is to identify the primary "object" or contiguous region of non-zero values in a 2D grid (likely representing an image or shape), crop it to its tight bounding box, and then pad the result to form a square grid while preserving the content. The output should be a transformed grid that isolates and normalizes the main feature for comparison or rendering.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of rows of integers (0 for empty/background, non-zero for filled/object pixels), and the "object" is defined by contiguous sequences of rows with non-zero counts, ignoring isolated or sparse rows.
 * Focus on the largest contiguous block of rows with any non-zeros to avoid including noise or separate components; subtle elements include handling rows with varying non-zero positions (e.g., irregular shapes) and ensuring column bounds are computed only over the selected rows.
 * Cropping must create a tight bounding box: min/max columns based on the first/last non-zero in each relevant row, but aggregated globally to avoid over-cropping jagged edges.
 * Padding to square should center the content (symmetric or near-symmetric padding with zeros) and handle cases where height and width differ, potentially starting from a 1x1 zero grid if empty.
 * Edge cases: empty grids, all-zero rows/columns, single-row/column objects, or grids where non-zeros don't align perfectly; avoid assuming uniform row lengths or non-negative values.
 * Non-zero values might represent different "colors" or intensities, but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding/cropping; preserve original values in the output.
 * Subtlety: Contiguous blocks reset on zero-count rows, so multiple objects might exist, but only the largest is selected—easy to miss if code doesn't properly scan for max length.
 * Global bounds must initialize correctly (e.g., min_col to infinity or grid width, max_col to -1) to handle rows with no non-zeros within the block.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is solid for row density; use it to identify active rows.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing; efficiently computes non-zero counts per row.)

```python
def find_largest_contiguous_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_length = 0
    best_start = 0
    current_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            length = i - current_start
            if length > max_length:
                max_length = length
                best_start = current_start
            current_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_length - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This correctly identifies the start/end of the largest run of non-zero-count rows; essential for isolating the main object vertically. Handles edge cases like all-zero grid returning (0,-1) or similar.)

```python
def get_row_first_last(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n  # Initialize to full width (beyond any valid index)
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row horizontal bounds; note initialization of first to n and last to -1 to handle all-zero rows gracefully, where (n, -1) indicates empty.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
(Reliable for extracting subgrid; assumes valid indices and handles empty slices.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    size = max(h, w)
    # Pad columns first if needed
    if w < size:
        pad_left = (size - w) // 2
        pad_right = size - w - pad_left
        for i in range(h):
            grid[i] = [0] * pad_left + grid[i] + [0] * pad_right
        w = size
    # Pad rows if needed
    if h < size:
        pad_top = (size - h) // 2
        pad_bottom = size - h - pad_top
        empty = [0] * size
        for _ in range(pad_top):
            grid.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(pad_bottom):
            grid.append(empty[:])
    return grid
```
(Effective for centering and squaring; handles empty grids and asymmetric padding well, preserving original values.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt demonstrates partial understanding of the puzzle by correctly identifying the need for contiguous row selection, per-row bounds, tight cropping, and square padding, but fails entirely due to a runtime error in all cases.
 * What worked: The vertical block detection (find_largest_contiguous_block) and per-row bounds (get_row_first_last) are logically sound and would isolate the main object if integrated properly; cropping and padding functions execute without issues in isolation.
 * What didn't work: The compute_global_bounds function is broken—it incorrectly initializes min_c as len(bounds[0][0]), where bounds[0][0] is an int (column index), causing "object of type 'int' has no len()" error on all inputs; this prevents any successful execution, so no outputs are generated for analysis.
 * No training examples or test passed; all resulted in the same execution error, indicating the bug blocks the entire pipeline.
 * The approach assumes the largest contiguous non-zero row block is the "object," which aligns with puzzle subtleties (e.g., ignoring noise), but untested due to crash.
 * Function compute_global_bounds is broken and unhelpful in its current form (causes crash; don't use without fixing initialization to something like min_c = float('inf') or grid width, and max_c = -1, then update only if l != -1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to the len() on int bug, so no actual grid is generated—completely incorrect and unusable for verification.
 * Expected test output should be a square-padded bounding box of the main contiguous object (e.g., if test input has a central shape spanning rows 2-5 and columns 3-7, output would crop to that 4x5 region, pad to 5x5 with zeros around, preserving non-zeros); the error prevents any match, and without seeing the input grid, it's unclear if the approach would otherwise align, but the crash confirms it does not produce a valid result.
 * This highlights the need to handle empty or edge rows in bounds aggregation without assuming non-empty tuples.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns (likely representing shapes, figures, or "objects" with pixel values like 3,5,6,8,4 indicating colors or types), where the goal is to extract the "main" or primary figure/object from the input grid, normalize its position (e.g., translate to top-left), compute a bounding box, and output a square grid representation padded with zeros, while ignoring or excluding noise, frames, or secondary elements. The output size is based on the max dimension of the extracted region, but the results suggest the extraction criteria (e.g., row selection, bounding box) are imprecise, leading to inclusions/exclusions of pixels that don't match expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain a "main" figure (dense cluster of non-zero pixels) surrounded by potential noise, frames, or disconnected elements (e.g., sparse lines or dots outside the core shape); the program must identify and isolate only the primary connected or consecutive component, excluding outer frames or isolated pixels.
 * Y-range selection is critical: use consecutive rows with non-zero sums, but prioritize the block with maximum total non-zero pixels to avoid noise; however, subtle disconnected parts (e.g., small protrusions or separate blobs) may need inclusion if part of the main structure, or exclusion if they are artifacts.
 * Bounding box computation must tightly fit the main figure's extent (min/max x/y of non-zeros in selected rows), but avoid expanding to include frame-like borders; translation shifts to (0,0) origin, and output is a square of side max(width, height) of the bbox, padded with zeros—do not return the original n x n size unless s == n.
 * Subtleties include handling asymmetric shapes (e.g., figures not centered), multiple potential "main" blocks (select largest by sum or area), and ensuring no pixel values are altered during extraction/translation—only positions change.
 * Noise handling: Grids may have zero-rows or sparse rows above/below/around the main figure; do not include them in the y-range or bbox unless they connect to the main structure.
 * Output must preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within the extracted region; mismatches often occur in top/bottom rows (e.g., extra 3s included as noise) or side alignments (e.g., shifted 8s or 6s).
 * Consider connected components: The main figure may not be fully rectangular; use row_bounds to find per-row min/max x, but aggregate carefully to avoid over-expansion.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return zero-filled n x n; if no main block, output zeros; varying grid sizes (10x10 or 13x13) mean s can be < n, leading to smaller outputs implicitly padded in display.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect y-range (including noise rows) or bbox (missing/extruding parts), resulting in shifted or incomplete figures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several modular functions for row analysis and extraction, which are partially useful for identifying and isolating regions but need refinement for accurate main figure selection (e.g., better y-range logic or component detection). No new types are defined, but Tuple[int, int] for bounds and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for pixels (y,x,value) are effective for handling positions and values.

The main `program` function composes these but is flawed in y-range/bbox selection; no explicit object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) is present, which might be needed for complex shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (all training examples failed); it correctly implements modular extraction/translation/padding but fails on core selection logic.
 * What worked: Pixel extraction preserves values; translation to (0,0) normalizes position; square padding handles varying bbox sizes; row_sums and row_bounds efficiently identify dense regions without full scans.
 * What didn't work: Y-range selection via max-sum consecutive rows includes noise (e.g., top/bottom sparse rows with 3s in train1), leading to bbox that captures extras; no handling for disconnected components or frames, causing over-inclusion; output size s often matches n but with misplaced pixels due to wrong min_y/max_y.
 * Train1: Generated includes extra 3s in row0 (positions 2,4) and row12 (3s at 3,4), but expected has 3s at 3 and 10 in row0, and 3s at 5 and 7 in row12; inner figure (8s,6s) is shifted/missing parts (e.g., generated row2 has 8s at 2-3 but expected at 3; row10 has 8s at 8-9 but expected at 9 missing); overall, figure is vertically expanded with noise, horizontally misaligned (unknown reason, possibly bbox min_x too low).
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 at 3 but expected all 0s except row1 3 at 6; row3 has 3s at 1-2 but expected 3 at 2; row4 has 5 at 0,3 at 2 but expected 5 at 0,3s at 1-2; row5 matches somewhat but row6 has 4s missing in expected positions; figure is incomplete/shifted rightward, with extra 3s in noise rows (e.g., row1), suggesting wrong y-range including top noise.
 * Train3: Generated row0/1 are [4,0,4,...]/[0,4,0,...] but expected swapped to [0,4,0,...]/[4,0,4,...], indicating possible rotation or frame misextraction; inner 1s/2s are misplaced (e.g., generated row2 has 1 at 5 but expected row2 all 0s except 1s at 3-4; row4 has 2s at 4-5 but expected row4 2s at 4-5 ok, but surrounding 1s wrong); frame is included but inverted, inner figure vertically shifted down by ~1 row (unknown reason, likely y-range starts too early).
 * Function `get_main_bbox` is helpful but broken when y-range is noisy (propagates errors); `find_main_y_range` is essential but insufficient (needs connectivity or size threshold); no unhelpful functions, but the composition in `program` assumes single main block—add component detection for multi-blob grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of normalization but misses subtle noise exclusion and precise component isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it extracts a partial figure (5s on sides, 3s/4s in middle) but places it starting from row1 (with row0 as [0s,3,3,0s] like noise or bottom fragment), repeats the pattern in rows1-2/4-5 but inverts or shifts (e.g., row2 has 3s at 4-8 but test input row? has different), adds isolated 3 in row6 middle, then pads with 7+ zero rows— this suggests wrong y-range (included top noise, excluded bottom?), incomplete bbox (missing left/right alignments, e.g., 5s at 0-1 and 11-12 but 3s not centered), and over-padding without centering. Expected likely a tight square of the central cross-like figure (3s horizontal, 4s vertical-ish, framed by 5s) translated to top-left without extras, possibly 7x7 or similar s<13, but output bloats to 13x13 with misplaced elements (e.g., duplicated rows 1/5 and 2/4 indicate loop error or wrong min_y). It fails to isolate the main "plus" shape, including apparent noise 3s, and doesn't match a clean normalized output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- **Preservation of individual properties across all examples**: Every element's color, hole count, and pixel count is preserved in the output for corresponding elements (no changes to these intrinsic properties; any removals are of outliers only, consistent in trains 1 and 3, with none in train 2).
- **Global translation of main cluster to top-left (0,0)**: In every example, the main group of overlapping or adjacent elements (defined by bbox proximity or containment) is translated such that the minimum x and minimum y of the group becomes 0, preserving relative positions within the group (e.g., train 1: -6x/0y shift for Green/Pink/big Maroon; train 2: -6x/-2y shift for most Oranges/Greens; train 3: variable per subgroup but overall mins to 0 for Yellow/Blue/Red clusters).
- **Position of small elements (pixels ≤ 6, often standalone squares) affected by larger/adjacent elements**: Small elements interact with nearby larger or framing elements by having their positions relocated relative to them after the main shift (consistent relocation, not random; e.g., train 1: small Maroon (p=3) moved from top-left adjacency to big Maroon to bottom-right relative position within shifted big Maroon bbox; train 2: Yellow (p=6) repositioned to center gap between adjacent Greens, preserving gap-based proximity; train 3: small Yellows (p=1) repositioned around Blue/Red bboxes to form consistent filler pattern relative to their input proximities).
- **Containment/adjacency affects relative positioning**: Elements whose input bboxes overlap or are adjacent (e.g., Pink inside Green in train 1; Yellow between Greens in train 2; Yellows near Blues in train 3) maintain or adjust relative positions in output based on the containing/framing element's new position (no absolute positions preserved, but relational; e.g., central elements like Pink/Yellow stay centrally relative to containers).
- **Outlier removal (position-based)**: Elements far from the main cluster (high/low bbox values relative to group min/max, e.g., >2 units beyond group extent) are consistently removed and not present in output (train 1: small elements at y=16-18; train 3: Yellow at x=14; none in train 2 as all within cluster).
- **Unknown: Exact relocation rule for small elements within main cluster**: While small elements consistently interact with larger ones via relative repositioning (e.g., to centers, corners, or gaps), the precise transformation (e.g., flip in train 1, centering in train 2, pattern-filling in train 3) cannot be explained as a single consistent mechanism across all without forcing unrelated patterns; appears influenced by shape properties (e.g., L-shaped Greens affecting Yellow gaps) but not uniform.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 13:00:10] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract the primary cluster or "object" of non-zero values from a sparse grid, crop to its tight bounding box (excluding distant outliers), translate the content to the top-left corner, and pad with zeros to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and shapes of the non-zero elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The primary task is outlier removal by selecting the densest contiguous block of rows with the most non-zeros, then cropping columns to the minimal bounding box that covers non-zeros only within that row block—this excludes scattered or distant elements (e.g., isolated 8's at the bottom in train1 or isolated 3's/4's in train2).
 * After cropping, translate the content to top-left (no leading zero rows or columns before the first non-zero), then pad to the smallest square size using zeros, but padding appears to be added only as needed on the right and bottom (not centered), maintaining the top-left alignment of the main cluster.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have multiple disconnected components (e.g., borders, stray pixels like the top-left 8's in train1 or bottom 5's in train2); only the main dense cluster should be kept, ignoring low-density or isolated parts. Padding must not introduce artificial centering that shifts the content away from top-left. Row/column counts must handle empty rows/columns correctly without including them in the bounding box. The output square size is determined by the max of cropped height and width, with uneven padding (e.g., more on one side if odd difference).
 * Considerations across attempts: Prefix sums for efficient max subarray sum on row densities work well for finding dense blocks but fail if the "best" block includes empty internal rows incorrectly or if column cropping leaks outliers from outside the row block. Centered padding breaks top-left alignment, leading to extra zeros on left/top. No handling for cases with no non-zeros (should return minimal [[0]]). Grids can be rectangular input but output must be square. Values like 3,5,8,4,6,1,2 are treated as non-zero "filled" pixels without regard to their specific numbers—only presence matters for density/cropping.
 * Easy-to-miss: The expected outputs preserve exact relative positions within the crop (no rotation/scaling), and the square padding is minimal (e.g., train1 expected is 13x13, not larger). Isolated single rows/columns of non-zeros (e.g., bottom 5's in train3) are outliers to ignore. If multiple dense blocks exist, pick the one with max total non-zeros, allowing internal empties but not extending to sparse ends.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    """Count the number of non-zero elements in a row."""
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is helpful for density calculations and works correctly.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Compute non-zero counts for each row in the grid."""
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preparing data for block selection.)

```python
def get_prefix_sums(counts: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Compute prefix sums of row counts for efficient range sum queries."""
    prefix = [0]
    for c in counts:
        prefix.append(prefix[-1] + c)
    return prefix
```
(Very helpful for O(n^2) max subarray sum to find densest row block efficiently; core to outlier removal.)

```python
def find_max_sum_row_block(prefix: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the contiguous row block with the maximum total non-zeros (allows internal empty rows)."""
    n = len(prefix) - 1
    max_sum = 0
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 2):
            current_sum = prefix[j - 1] - prefix[i]
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_start = i
                best_end = j - 2  # Adjust for prefix indexing
    return best_start, best_end
```
(Helpful for selecting the main row block but buggy in indexing—best_end = j-2 can cause off-by-one errors leading to included/excluded rows; still useful as a base for density-based selection.)

```python
def find_col_bounds(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the minimal and maximal column indices with non-zeros in the row block."""
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g and g[0] else 0
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    has_nonzero = False
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i]
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                min_c = min(min_c, j)
                max_c = max(max_c, j)
                has_nonzero = True
    if not has_nonzero:
        return 0, 0
    return min_c, max_c
```
(Helpful for column cropping within the selected rows; correctly ignores zeros but assumes uniform column length—works well if no outliers outside row block.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Crop the grid to the specified row and column range (preserves relative positions)."""
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row_slice = g[i][min_c:max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row_slice)
    return cropped
```
(Helpful and correct for extracting the subgrid; preserves exact values and positions.)

The following function is broken/not helpful:
```python
def pad_to_square_size(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Pad the cropped grid to a square by adding zero rows and columns centered (global translation and padding rule)."""
    # ... (centered padding logic)
```
(This is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle: it centers padding, shifting content away from top-left, which mismatches all expectations; replace with top-left padding to right/bottom.)

```python
def remove_outliers_by_block(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Select the densest row block to exclude distant outliers (outlier removal rule)."""
    # Composes the above but inherits bugs from find_max_sum_row_block and lacks top-left translation.
```
(Partially helpful as a composer but overall broken due to no translation step after crop and buggy block selection.)

No types like classes are used; simple List[List[int]] for grids is sufficient. No extraction of "objects" beyond density-based cropping is needed—treating the grid as a binary image (non-zero vs zero) for bounding box is key.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the need for density-based row block selection (using max subarray sum on row non-zero counts) to remove outliers, which works conceptually for excluding sparse rows (e.g., empty rows in train1).
 * What worked: Prefix sum approach efficiently finds contiguous dense rows; column bounding correctly tightens width to non-zeros in the block; cropping preserves relative positions and values.
 * What didn't work: All three training examples failed completely—generated outputs include extra padding, outliers, and wrong sizes/shifts. For train1, generated a oversized ~19x19 grid with centered padding, including bottom 8's as outliers and extra left/top zeros, vs expected 13x13 top-left cropped main 3/8 figure (missing bottom padding row and left zeros in some places). For train2, generated ~17x17 with stray 3's/4's/5's not cropped out, centered, and wrong row order/alignment vs expected 10x10 tight crop of central 5/3/4 cluster. For train3, generated mostly zeros with scattered remnants (e.g., isolated 1's and bottom 4's not excluded), oversized, vs expected 10x10 tight alternating 4/1/2 pattern cropped from middle.
 * Missed top-left translation after cropping (generated has centered zeros on left/top); buggy best_end indexing in find_max_sum_row_block likely includes/excludes wrong rows (e.g., train1 includes too many empty rows). Centered padding is a core mismatch—always shifts content incorrectly. No handling for multiple candidate blocks (always picks max but may pick wrong if ties). Function pad_to_square_size is incorrect/not relevant (causes all alignment failures; avoid in future). Overall, partial understanding of cropping but fails on alignment/padding, leading to no training passes. extract_objects-like logic isn't present but density cropping approximates it helpfully.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to be an uncropped or partially processed ~19x19 grid including multiple disconnected clusters (e.g., top scattered 3/5/4's, middle 3/4/5's, bottom 5's) without tight bounding, top-left alignment, or square padding; it has irregular leading zeros per row and preserves full input width/sparsity, suggesting the program applied loose row block selection but failed column crop or padding entirely (e.g., includes empty columns and distant 5's at bottom-right). This mismatches the pattern from trainings, where outputs should be small tight squares (~10-13 size) with only the densest central cluster (likely the middle 3/4/5 block here, cropped to ~8x10 then padded to 10x10 top-left). It looks like a near-input copy with some row selection but no real processing, so incorrect—likely due to indexing bugs including extra rows/columns and no translation.

[2025-10-03 13:00:37] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear **in every train example** (inputs 1-3 and their corresponding outputs). I focused only on properties like color, holes, pixels, bbox (position and size), and spatial relations (e.g., overlap or containment) that show clear, direct effects or links (e.g., one property influencing another's transformation or placement). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone small blocks with no overlapping bboxes or shared properties across examples) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., hole counts, which are 1 in train 1 but 0 in trains 2 and 3) are not included. Where a connection involves an unexplainable transformation, it is noted as unknown.

- **Color groups to pixel counts (preservation effect)**: Components grouped by color have their individual pixel counts preserved in the output for matching components (e.g., a specific component with pixels=N in input appears with pixels=N in output). This is consistent across all examples, indicating color acts as an identifier that links input components to their output counterparts, affecting which pixels are retained during transformation. Examples:
  - Train 1: Pink component (pixels=12) preserved; large Maroon (pixels=37) preserved; small Maroon (pixels=3) preserved.
  - Train 2: Yellow component (pixels=6) preserved; each Green component (pixels=5) preserved individually.
  - Train 3: Red component (pixels=4) preserved; multiple Yellow components (pixels=1 each) preserved individually.
  - Note: Total pixels per color may vary slightly due to ignored peripheral elements (see below), but individual component links hold.

- **Bbox size (width/height derived from [x1,y1,x2,y2]) to shape preservation**: For components where input bbox defines a clear rectangular extent (width = x2 - x1 + 1, height = y2 - y1 + 1), the output bbox preserves the exact width and height dimensions. This links shape properties to transformation rules, ensuring geometric form affects repositioning without scaling. Consistent in trains 1 and 2 (where multi-pixel components exist); in train 3, single-pixel components trivially preserve 1x1 size, making it consistent across all.
  - Train 1: Pink input bbox size (5x5) -> output (5x5); large Maroon (9x9) -> (9x9); small Maroon (2x2) -> (2x2).
  - Train 2: Yellow (3x3) -> (3x3); Greens (e.g., 4x2 or 2x4) -> matching (4x2 or 2x4) individually.
  - Train 3: All listed components are 1x1 or small rectangles (e.g., Red 2x2) -> output matches (e.g., Red 2x2).

- **Position (bbox coordinates) to repositioning (unknown transformation)**: Input bbox positions directly influence output positions, with all main components repositioned relative to a top-left normalization (outputs start from [0,0] bounding area). This is a consistent link (position affects movement), but the exact transformation rule (e.g., shift amount or sorting logic) is unknown and varies (e.g., uniform left-shift in train 1, non-uniform in trains 2 and 3). No forced explanation; noted as unknown effect on final coordinates.
  - Applies to all main components across examples (e.g., central/large elements move into a compact [0,max] grid).

- **Peripheral small components (high y-position) to ignoring (exclusion effect)**: Small, standalone components at high y-positions (y >=15) with low pixels (1-2) and no bbox overlap with main structures are consistently excluded from outputs in trains 1 and 2, linking their position to non-inclusion in transformation. In train 3, no such peripheral components exist (all interact via repositioning), but the pattern holds as "no exclusion needed" for consistency. This affects overall pixel totals but not main component links.
  - Train 1: Small Maroon (y16-17, pixels=2), Green (y18, pixels=1), Pink (y18, pixels=2) ignored.
  - Train 2: Small Green (y15, pixels=1), Yellow (y16, pixels=1) ignored.
  - Train 3: No high-y isolates; all repositioned (consistent with no exclusion required).

No other obvious connections (e.g., hole count -> color change, color -> hole creation, or specific overlaps like containment) are consistent across **every** example—train 1 shows some containment (e.g., Pink inside Green bbox), but trains 2 and 3 lack it for main components. Specific shape silhouettes (e.g., lines vs. blocks) vary too much to link consistently without forcing unrelated patterns.


============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 13:05:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract or crop a subgrid from a larger input grid (likely square, with dimensions around 10-13 based on examples) that captures the "core" or primary patterned object(s) formed by non-zero numbers, while excluding border padding, empty rows/columns, or extraneous elements. The output should be a rectangular or square subgrid that matches the expected structure exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of the numbers (which seem to represent colors, labels, or connected components like blobs/shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid contains non-zero numbers (e.g., 3,8,6 in train1; 5,3,4 in train2; 4,1,2 in train3) arranged in patterns that likely form distinct "objects" or shapes, surrounded by zeros acting as background or padding; the task is to isolate the bounding box of the main object(s), but not just any dense area—subtleties include handling irregular shapes, multiple components, and ensuring the crop aligns precisely with the expected layout (e.g., including specific zero placements within the object).
 * Outputs must match the expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected is 13 rows x 13 columns, but generated is 12x12; train2 expected 10x10, generated 10x10 but content wrong; train3 expected 10x10 with rotated/shifted elements, generated 9x9?); mismatches in size indicate failure to detect the correct span or padding.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have "borders" or frames (e.g., 3's outlining in train1, 5's in train2/train3), internal zeros that are part of the shape (not to be cropped out), and asymmetric placements (e.g., objects not centered, with uneven padding); vertical and horizontal cropping must consider the minimal bounding box that includes all relevant non-zeros without trimming internal structure.
 * Connected components or spans: Non-zeros form blobs (e.g., 8's as one shape, 6's as another in train1), and the crop should encompass the largest or primary blob(s); however, it's not just max span—expected outputs shift or select specific alignments (e.g., train1 expected starts columns later, includes extra row/column with sparse 3's).
 * Padding and zeros: Expected outputs retain some outer zeros if they are part of the frame (e.g., train1 expected has leading/trailing zeros in rows), but exclude large empty borders; generated outputs often over-crop or misalign, removing necessary zeros or adding incorrect padding.
 * Multiple objects: Grids may have hierarchical or adjacent shapes (e.g., train1 has 3-frame around 8/6 innards; train2 has 5-frame with internal 3/4; train3 has 4-frame with internal 1/2), requiring the crop to include the enclosing frame without fragmenting internals.
 * Vertical selection: Not all rows with max horizontal span are equal; expected selects a contiguous block but shifted (e.g., train1 generated starts at row 1, expected includes row 0 and 12 with sparse elements).
 * Horizontal alignment: Left edge is not always the global min column; it must align to the frame's start (e.g., train1 generated left=1 based on min_first, but expected left=3 with more leading zeros).
 * Density vs. structure: Summing non-zero counts for vertical selection works partially but fails when multiple candidate blocks have similar sums; expected prioritizes structural integrity over max density.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero rows/columns in output only if they frame the object (e.g., train3 expected has patterned borders); test input has scattered 5/3/4 patterns, likely needing a crop that captures a central cross-like or framed shape.
 * Overall: The puzzle emphasizes exact reproduction of the "visible" core image, possibly from a larger canvas with margins; failures often stem from incorrect bounding box calculation, ignoring frame elements, or wrong vertical/horizontal slicing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes some potentially useful primitives for analysis, but they are flawed in application.

```python
from typing import List

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is helpful for measuring row density, useful for vertical block selection, but insufficient alone as it ignores column-wise or structural alignment.)

```python
def get_span(row: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    first = None
    for i in range(n):
        if row[i] != 0:
            first = i
            break
    if first is None:
        return 0
    last = None
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if row[i] != 0:
            last = i
            break
    return last - first + 1 if last is not None else 0
```
(This computes the width of the non-zero segment in a row, helpful for identifying max pattern size horizontally, but misses multi-segment rows or frame detection; could be extended for column spans.)

No other types or tools are provided; future attempts might benefit from functions to find bounding boxes (min/max row/col with non-zeros), detect connected components (e.g., flood fill for blobs), or compute minimal enclosing rectangle for specific values (e.g., trace 3-frames).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt provided, which attempts a cropping strategy based on max horizontal spans and vertical density sums, but all training examples fail due to dimensional mismatches (e.g., train1 generated 12x12 vs. expected 13x13) and content errors (e.g., wrong left alignment, missing sparse frame rows).
 * Worked partially: Horizontal span detection identifies a reasonable size (e.g., captures width of main patterns), and vertical density sum selects a dense block (e.g., train1 generated includes core 8/6 rows 2-10, which overlap expected).
 * Did not work: Over-relies on max span rows for left alignment (e.g., train1 min_first=1 from row1's 3, but expected left=3 to include more padding and align frame); vertical selection picks wrong start (e.g., train1 best_start=1, skipping row0's sparse 3's and excluding row12); adds incorrect padding in rows (e.g., train1 generated pads short rows with zeros on right, but expected has exact 13 cols without padding); ignores overall grid symmetry or frame tracing.
 * Train1: Generated shifts left edge too far left (starts at col1 with 0,0,3 vs. expected col3 with 0,0,0,3), includes wrong row block (rows1-12, missing top/bottom sparse rows, extra dense row10 that's not in expected block), and trims to 12 cols (loses right 3's); differences include misplaced 8's/6's (e.g., generated row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs. expected row2: [0,3,0,8,0,8,...])—unknown why exact positions mismatch, possibly due to wrong left/right calc.
 * Train2: Generated has correct 10x10 size but wrong content (e.g., row3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—generated fills internal zeros incorrectly, shifts 3's/4's leftward); includes row1 as [0,0,0,3,...] but expected has it as empty-ish [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]; vertical block starts too early, capturing wrong frame alignment.
 * Train3: Generated appears 9x9 (rows listed as 9, but code aims for size=9?), with shifted borders (e.g., row0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] vs. expected row9: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—seems rotated or flipped incorrectly); internal 1/2 placements wrong (e.g., row4: [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4] vs. expected row4: [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—generated adds extra leading 4's, loses padding); function get_span likely picks wrong max_s (9 vs. expected 10, trimming borders).
 * The core program(g) function is broken for dimension handling (assumes square crop of max_s, pads incorrectly, selects suboptimal vertical block); count_nonzeros and get_span are helpful but not sufficient—need better bounding box or frame detection; avoid overusing density sums without structural checks, as it leads to dense-but-misaligned crops.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears malformed/incomplete for the puzzle: it has 13 rows but varying lengths (some 13 elems, but structure is ragged); includes large empty rows (e.g., row2 all zeros, row10 all zeros), which likely shouldn't be in a core crop unless framing, but here they disrupt the pattern; the visible parts show a scattered 5/3/4 arrangement (e.g., row4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] seems like a horizontal bar, row6: [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] with a 4 insert), but it's vertically spread with empties, suggesting wrong vertical block selection (probably picked a non-contiguous or padded block including borders).
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Assuming test input has a central framed object with 5's as outer, 3's/4's inner (based on scattered non-zeros around center), expected should be a tight ~9-11x13 crop centering the cross/bar patterns without full empty rows (e.g., exclude top/bottom empties, align left to first 5/3 col ~4, right to last ~12); generated includes too many leading/trailing zeros per row and wrong row selection (e.g., starts with sparse row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0], but likely expected skips to denser block starting row4); it fails to capture a cohesive shape, outputting a "smeared" version with isolated elements—does not make sense as a core extraction, missing subtle frame alignment (e.g., 5's not properly bordering 3/4's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely binary or simple numeric grids representing shapes or objects), where the goal is to identify and extract the "main" contiguous block or object (defined by non-zero cells), crop it to its minimal bounding box, and then pad it symmetrically to form a square grid of appropriate size, preserving the object's structure for further puzzle-solving or recognition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of rows of integers (likely 0s for empty space and non-zero values like 1s for filled cells in an object or shape).
 * Identify the "main block" by finding the row with the highest density of non-zero cells, then extend contiguously up and down to include all adjacent non-zero rows, assuming the object is a single connected vertical block without gaps.
 * After selecting rows, compute the tightest column bounds across those rows by finding the global min/first non-zero column and max/last non-zero column, ignoring fully zero rows or columns.
 * Crop to the bounding box (subgrid of selected rows and columns), then pad with zeros to make it square: first pad columns to match the max of height/width, centering the content; then pad rows similarly if needed.
 * Edge cases include empty grids (return a single [[0]] or similar minimal square), grids where the object doesn't span all columns/rows, or where non-zero counts are zero (handle gracefully without errors).
 * Subtlety: Padding must be centered (equal or floor/ceil split on both sides) to maintain visual symmetry, and the final size should be the max of the cropped height/width, not hardcoded.
 * Assume the grid is rectangular (all rows same length), but the object may not fill the entire grid—avoid including sparse or disconnected parts.
 * Non-zero cells might vary in value (e.g., different numbers for shading), but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding and cropping.
 * Potential for multiple objects: The code assumes one main block via max density row, but puzzles might require selecting the largest/densest without merging disconnected components.

These functions handle row density calculation, block selection, per-row bounds, cropping, and centered padding effectively, and can be reused or minimally fixed for future attempts.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Compute global min first and max last over selected rows."""
    min_c = len(bounds[0][0]) if bounds else 0  # Use a large number  # BROKEN: bounds[0][0] is int, len(int) errors
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
This function is broken due to attempting len() on an int (should initialize min_c to a large value like len(g[0]) instead of len(bounds[0][0])), causing runtime errors on all inputs; it cannot be used as-is and needs fixing to compute column bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the core logic of finding a dense contiguous row block via non-zero counts and extending boundaries, which aligns with extracting a main object.
 * Row and column bound calculation (via get_row_bounds) works in principle for tight cropping, and padding functions ensure centered square output, which seems essential for visual puzzles.
 * However, the entire program fails to execute due to a bug in compute_col_bounds (len() on int), producing errors instead of grids for all cases—nothing "works" in terms of runnable output.
 * Block selection assumes vertical contiguity without gaps, which may miss horizontal-only or disconnected objects, but it's a reasonable start if the puzzle focuses on single blobs.
 * Cropping and padding are applied in the right order (columns first, then rows), but untested due to the crash.
 * No extraction of multiple objects or handling of varying non-zero values beyond binary count; assumes one main block, which might overlook puzzles with noise or multiple components.
 * The main function handles empty grids minimally, but the error prevents verification.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of cropping/padding to square but zero progress on execution, as all attempts (this one) crash identically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or produce a valid grid—it indicates a runtime failure rather than an incorrect but runnable result.
 * No actual grid is generated, so it cannot match any expected cropped/padded square for the test input; the error occurs early in compute_col_bounds, preventing any output.
 * This differs from expectations (a padded square grid representing the main object) because the code crashes instead of processing the grid; likely the test input has a valid non-empty grid, but the bug blocks all progress.
 * Without seeing the test grid, the error suggests the code isn't robust to standard inputs (e.g., non-empty bounds tuples), and future fixes must ensure no type mismatches to handle the test case properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop and normalize a larger input grid (likely 20x20 with non-zero elements forming visual "objects" or patterns in the top portion) into the smallest possible square grid that tightly bounds all non-zero cells, by shifting the content to start at position (0,0) and padding the rest with zeros to make it square (using the maximum of the bounding height and width as the side length). The output preserves the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but eliminates empty space around the edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids appear to be 20x20, but non-zero content is confined to the top ~16 rows (rows 0-15), with rows 16-19 likely being empty or irrelevant (e.g., a footer or padding); however, hardcoding "i < 16" in min/max calculations risks excluding valid content if it spills over or if the rule is more flexible.
 * Compute the bounding box by finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices with any non-zero value; height = max_r - min_r + 1, width = max_c - min_c + 1; side length s = max(height, width) to ensure a square output.
 * Shift all non-zero cells by subtracting min_r from their row index and min_c from their column index, placing them in a new s x s grid starting at (0,0); any cells that would fall outside after shifting are discarded (though this hasn't occurred in examples).
 * Outputs are printed as lists of integers (one per row), with the number of lists indicating the grid height (which should equal s); all outputs must be square, but the provided generated outputs vary in size and include unnecessary empty rows/columns.
 * Subtlety: Disconnected components or scattered non-zeros (e.g., in train3, there are separate 1's, 4's, and 2's) must all be included in the single bounding box—no extraction of individual "objects"; the entire non-zero content is treated as one unit.
 * Easy to miss: Padding must be zeros only outside the shifted bounding box; do not alter values or introduce new non-zeros; if the bounding box is empty or all zeros, output a 0x0 or minimal grid, but examples have content.
 * Grids may have irregular shapes (e.g., train1 has a frame-like 3's with internal 8's, 6's; train2 has nested shapes with 5's as borders), so min/max must scan every cell accurately without assuming connectivity.
 * Outputs in examples are rectangular in print but should represent square grids (e.g., train2 expected is 10x10, but printed as 10 lists of 10 ints); ensure no trailing empty rows/columns in the final grid.
 * The program ignores rows >=16 entirely in min/max, which works if content is always top-heavy but fails if not; also, if min_r ==20 (all empty in top 16), it returns 0, which may pad incorrectly.
 * No rotation, scaling, or value changes—just translation to top-left and squaring.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions for finding min/max row/col and shifting are conceptually useful but buggy (e.g., hardcoded i<16 limits scanning; compute_size is correct but simplistic; shift_and_place discards out-of-bounds but doesn't handle empty cases well). Here's a refined version without the row limit, using full 20x20 scan:

```python
from typing import List

def find_min_r(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    min_r = len(g)  # Assume 20
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, i)
                break  # Optimize: once row has non-zero, it's min
    return min_r if min_r < len(g) else 0  # 0 if empty?

def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    max_r = -1
    for i in range(len(g) - 1, -1, -1):  # Scan from bottom for efficiency
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                max_r = i
                break
    return max_r if max_r >= 0 else 0

# Similar for find_min_c and find_max_c, scanning columns fully without i<16 limit

def compute_size(h: int, w: int) -> int:
    return max(h, w) if h > 0 and w > 0 else 0  # Handle empty case

def create_empty_grid(s: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[0] * s for _ in range(s)] if s > 0 else []

def shift_and_place(g: List[List[int]], new_grid: List[List[int]], min_r: int, min_c: int, s: int) -> None:
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                ni = i - min_r
                nj = j - min_c
                if 0 <= ni < s and 0 <= nj < s:
                    new_grid[ni][nj] = g[i][j]
```

No types like PuzzleElement are needed; simple grid ops suffice. Function to extract all non-zero positions could help verify bounding box:

```python
def get_nonzero_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    positions = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                positions.append((i, j))
    return positions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a bounding box approach but hardcoded row scans to i<16, which excluded potential content below row 15 and led to incorrect min_r/max_r in cases with bottom content (though examples seem top-confined, it still failed due to sizing/shifting bugs).
 * What worked: Shifting logic in shift_and_place correctly translates cells relative to min_r/min_c; compute_size correctly makes square by max(h,w); it identified non-zeros and avoided overwriting.
 * What didn't work: Hardcoded i<16 in all find_* functions ignored rows 16-19, but even if content is there, it caused oversized s (e.g., if min_r=0, h=16ish, s large); returned 0 for empty scans but didn't handle s=0 properly, leading to empty or mismatched grids.
 * Train1: Generated a ~13x13 grid but misplaced elements—e.g., row0 has [0,0,3,0,3,...] (two 3's too early) vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] (single 3 later); internal 8's and 6's shifted wrong, with extra 3's in row2 and missing shifts in lower rows; overall, bounding box too loose, including phantom space on left/top.
 * Train2: Generated ~15x15 with lots of empty rows/columns (e.g., many leading/trailing 0's per row, and empty rows at bottom); expected is tight 10x10—e.g., generated row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,...] has scattered 5's not shifted to tight bound, while expected starts with [5,0,5,...] packed left; 3's and 4's misaligned, with extra padding.
 * Train3: Generated ~14x14 with excessive empties (e.g., many all-zero rows at top/middle); expected 10x10 tight—e.g., generated has isolated 1's and 4's spread out (row0 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,...] vs expected starting directly with [0,4,0,4,...]); alternating 4's not packed, 2's blob shifted incorrectly, leading to loose bounds.
 * No object extraction function was used or needed; the attempt treated the whole grid as one, which is correct, but didn't verify with something like get_nonzero_positions to debug bounds.
 * Function find_min_r etc. are helpful but broken due to i<16—remove limit; shift_and_place is useful but should check for empty input (s=0) to return empty list.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The hardcoded row limit makes all scans incomplete; compute_size returns max even if h=0, potentially giving s=w but wrong if empty; no handling for non-square inputs leading to oversized outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it generates a nearly full 19x19 grid (19 rows listed, many with 19 elements) filled mostly with zeros and scattered non-zeros (e.g., 5's in columns 3-4 early on, 3's at bottom-left, 4 in row12 col12), but fails to tightly bound or shift: e.g., non-zeros span from row2 (3's) to row15 (3's), columns 2-18, but output includes huge empty top/left/right/bottom padding instead of cropping to ~14x17 then squaring to 17x17 and shifting everything to top-left.
 * It looks incorrect because the bounding box isn't computed tightly (likely due to i<16 including too much empty space above/below, or wrong min_r=0 assuming full height); shifted positions are off—e.g., the cluster of 3's/5's/4 in rows10-15 cols9-18 should pack to row0 col0 start, but remains offset; extra empty rows (e.g., rows5-6,8-9 all zeros) bloat the size unnecessarily.
 * Does not make sense: Expected should be a compact square (s~10-14 based on visible clusters: vertical 5's early, horizontal 3's/5's bottom), with all non-zeros contiguous from (0,0), no scattered empties inside bounds; this output retains input layout too closely without proper crop/shift, suggesting the i<16 bug or full-grid scan without true min/max.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels or labeled regions in a visual drawing) to isolate and output a cropped, centered, and square-padded version of the primary "object" or content, excluding backgrounds, frames, or extraneous elements. The goal appears to be tight bounding box cropping around the meaningful visual element, followed by padding to a square, but the exact definition of the "primary object" (e.g., excluding connected borders or frames) is key to matching expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids contain numbers like 0 (background), 3 (possibly a frame or border color), 4/5/6/8 (object colors), and the output must preserve these values exactly while adjusting positions via cropping/padding.
 * Connected components are 8-directional (including diagonals), which is correctly implemented, but the "largest" component may include unwanted frames (e.g., surrounding 3's in train1 and test), leading to overly broad bounding boxes that shift or include extra elements.
 * Cropping must be precise to the minimal bounding box of the intended object; padding centers the cropped content in a square of side max(height, width) of the crop, with 0's filling edges, but misalignment occurs if the bbox is wrong (e.g., generated outputs shift rows/columns relative to expected).
 * Subtle elements: Outer frames (e.g., 3's in train1/test) seem treated as background to exclude, not part of the object; multiple components exist (e.g., separate blobs of 4/6/8), so largest-by-size may grab the frame instead of the inner drawing. In train2/3, rotations or symmetries in borders (5's/4's) suggest excluding perimeter patterns. Padding must not introduce asymmetries; expected outputs often have irregular padding (e.g., more 0's on one side).
 * All non-zero cells aren't always the object—likely need to ignore border-like structures (e.g., full rows/columns of same number). Outputs are always square-padded but dimensions vary (13x13 for train1, 10x10 for train2/3, 7x7 for test).
 * Easy to miss: Component size counts cells, but frames may be larger; bbox updates must track min/max accurately during flood-fill. No rotation or flipping seems needed, but symmetries in inputs (e.g., test's H-like 3's with inner 4) imply symmetric cropping.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes largest component is the target, which fails; need to perhaps find bbox of all non-zero or subtract frame. Outputs must match expected exactly, including 0 placements—no tolerance for shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_largest_component_bbox(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    # (as provided: flood-fills 8-connected components to find largest by cell count, tracks bbox)
    # Helpful for identifying connected regions, but flawed as it grabs frames; could modify to skip border-connected or find second-largest.
    pass

def crop_and_pad(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (as provided: extracts subgrid to bbox, pads to square with 0's in top-left alignment)
    # Core logic is sound for post-bbox processing; ensures square output. Subtle issue: assumes input indices valid, but works if bbox correct. Helpful for final formatting.
    pass
```
```python
# No other functions in attempt; could add:
def find_all_nonzero_bbox(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    # Alternative: min/max over all non-zero cells (ignores connectivity); might capture full content without component bias.
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = rows, 0, cols, 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, r)
                max_r = max(max_r, r)
                min_c = min(min_c, c)
                max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c if min_r <= max_r else (0, 0, 0, 0)
```
* No unhelpful/broken functions in attempt; the provided ones are relevant but insufficient alone (e.g., find_largest_component_bbox grabs wrong region).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Single attempt shown: All three training examples failed due to incorrect bbox selection, leading to shifted or inclusive cropping that mismatches expected positions and includes/excludes wrong elements.
 * Train1: Generated crops to a 13x13 square including a full 3's frame and inner elements, but bbox starts too left/early (e.g., row1 has 3 at col3 and col5, vs expected's 3's at col4 and col11; row3 has 8's starting col3 vs expected col4; overall, generated includes extra top-left 3's and misaligns bottom rows like row10 having 8's where expected has 0's). What worked: Correctly identifies connected 3/8/6 regions and pads to square. What didn't: Largest component is the 3's frame (connected around edges), bloating bbox and shifting content right/down vs expected (which seems to crop tighter around inner 8/6 with partial 3's).
 * Train2: Generated 10x10 crops include 5's border and inner 3/4, but misaligns (e.g., row2 has 3's starting col4 vs expected row2 all 0's except col7=3; row4 has 3's at col2/3 and 4 at col5/6 vs expected row4 3's at col3 and 4's shifted right; includes extra 5's on right). What worked: Padding logic centers roughly. What didn't: Grabs 5's frame as part of largest component, causing vertical/horizontal shifts; expected excludes some 0-rows and adjusts for inner 3/4 blob, possibly treating 5's as background.
 * Train3: Generated 10x10 includes 4's border and inner 1/2, but rotates or shifts borders (e.g., row1 starts with 4,0,4,... vs expected row1 0,4,0,...; row3 has 1 at col4 vs expected row3 1's at col4/5 but different 0 placements; overall, generated seems to crop from a different origin, including extra 4's on edges). What worked: 8-connected flood-fill correctly groups 1/2/4. What didn't: Largest component includes perimeter 4's (alternating pattern), leading to bbox that flips or misaligns symmetries; expected tightens to inner 1/2 with minimal border, suggesting frame exclusion.
 * General: Attempt understands connected components and bbox/padding, but misses that frames (3/5/4 borders) are not the "object"—need to detect/exclude them (e.g., via perimeter check or non-largest component). No extraction of "objects" beyond largest; could add frame detection. Unknown why shifts occur exactly (possibly bbox min_r/min_c off by 1-2 due to frame inclusion).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (7x7) does not look correct: It crops to include the full 3's frame (forming an H or window shape) with inner 4, but bbox seems too broad/left-aligned (e.g., row1 [0,0,3,3,0,0,0] includes left 3's cluster; row7 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0] has bottom-right 3 isolated). Expected likely tighter around the central 4 and symmetric 3's arms, excluding outer 0's or frame edges—e.g., should center the 4 at ~row4/col4 with balanced 3's padding, matching train patterns where frames are partially omitted/shifted (e.g., more 0's on sides, no full border inclusion). This fails similarly to trainings by treating the 3's frame as the primary component; to fix, exclude perimeter-connected 3's or use overall non-zero bbox for tighter fit.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract the primary cluster or "object" of non-zero values from a sparse grid, crop to its tight bounding box (excluding distant outliers), translate the content to the top-left corner, and pad with zeros to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and shapes of the non-zero elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The primary task is outlier removal by selecting the densest contiguous block of rows with the most non-zeros, then cropping columns to the minimal bounding box that covers non-zeros only within that row block—this excludes scattered or distant elements (e.g., isolated 8's at the bottom in train1 or isolated 3's/4's in train2).
 * After cropping, translate the content to top-left (no leading zero rows or columns before the first non-zero), then pad to the smallest square size using zeros, but padding appears to be added only as needed on the right and bottom (not centered), maintaining the top-left alignment of the main cluster.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have multiple disconnected components (e.g., borders, stray pixels like the top-left 8's in train1 or bottom 5's in train2); only the main dense cluster should be kept, ignoring low-density or isolated parts. Padding must not introduce artificial centering that shifts the content away from top-left. Row/column counts must handle empty rows/columns correctly without including them in the bounding box. The output square size is determined by the max of cropped height and width, with uneven padding (e.g., more on one side if odd difference).
 * Considerations across attempts: Prefix sums for efficient max subarray sum on row densities work well for finding dense blocks but fail if the "best" block includes empty internal rows incorrectly or if column cropping leaks outliers from outside the row block. Centered padding breaks top-left alignment, leading to extra zeros on left/top. No handling for cases with no non-zeros (should return minimal [[0]]). Grids can be rectangular input but output must be square. Values like 3,5,8,4,6,1,2 are treated as non-zero "filled" pixels without regard to their specific numbers—only presence matters for density/cropping.
 * Easy-to-miss: The expected outputs preserve exact relative positions within the crop (no rotation/scaling), and the square padding is minimal (e.g., train1 expected is 13x13, not larger). Isolated single rows/columns of non-zeros (e.g., bottom 5's in train3) are outliers to ignore. If multiple dense blocks exist, pick the one with max total non-zeros, allowing internal empties but not extending to sparse ends.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    """Count the number of non-zero elements in a row."""
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is helpful for density calculations and works correctly.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Compute non-zero counts for each row in the grid."""
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preparing data for block selection.)

```python
def get_prefix_sums(counts: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Compute prefix sums of row counts for efficient range sum queries."""
    prefix = [0]
    for c in counts:
        prefix.append(prefix[-1] + c)
    return prefix
```
(Very helpful for O(n^2) max subarray sum to find densest row block efficiently; core to outlier removal.)

```python
def find_max_sum_row_block(prefix: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the contiguous row block with the maximum total non-zeros (allows internal empty rows)."""
    n = len(prefix) - 1
    max_sum = 0
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 2):
            current_sum = prefix[j - 1] - prefix[i]
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_start = i
                best_end = j - 2  # Adjust for prefix indexing
    return best_start, best_end
```
(Helpful for selecting the main row block but buggy in indexing—best_end = j-2 can cause off-by-one errors leading to included/excluded rows; still useful as a base for density-based selection.)

```python
def find_col_bounds(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the minimal and maximal column indices with non-zeros in the row block."""

    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    has_nonzero = False
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i]
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                min_c = min(min_c, j)
                max_c = max(max_c, j)
                has_nonzero = True
    if not has_nonzero:
        return 0, 0
    return min_c, max_c
```
(Helpful for column cropping within the selected rows; correctly ignores zeros but assumes uniform column length—works well if no outliers outside row block.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:

        row_slice = g[i][min_c:max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row_slice)
    return cropped
```
(Helpful and correct for extracting the subgrid; preserves exact values and positions.)

The following function is broken/not helpful:
```python
def pad_to_square_size(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Pad the cropped grid to a square by adding zero rows and columns centered (global translation and padding rule)."""
    # ... (centered padding logic)
```
(This is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle: it centers padding, shifting content away from top-left, which mismatches all expectations; replace with top-left padding to right/bottom.)

```python
def remove_outliers_by_block(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Select the densest row block to exclude distant outliers (outlier removal rule)."""
    # Composes the above but inherits bugs from find_max_sum_row_block and lacks top-left translation.
```
(Partially helpful as a composer but overall broken due to no translation step after crop and buggy block selection.)

No types like classes are used; simple List[List[int]] for grids is sufficient. No extraction of "objects" beyond density-based cropping is needed—treating the grid as a binary image (non-zero vs zero) for bounding box is key.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the need for density-based row block selection (using max subarray sum on row non-zero counts) to remove outliers, which works conceptually for excluding sparse rows (e.g., empty rows in train1).
 * What worked: Prefix sum approach efficiently finds contiguous dense rows; column bounding correctly tightens width to non-zeros in the block; cropping preserves relative positions and values.
 * What didn't work: All three training examples failed completely—generated outputs include extra padding, outliers, and wrong sizes/shifts. For train1, generated a oversized ~19x19 grid with centered padding, including bottom 8's as outliers and extra left/top zeros, vs expected 13x13 top-left cropped main 3/8 figure (missing bottom padding row and left zeros in some places). For train2, generated ~17x17 with stray 3's/4's/5's not cropped out, centered, and wrong row order/alignment vs expected 10x10 tight crop of central 5/3/4 cluster. For train3, generated mostly zeros with scattered remnants (e.g., isolated 1's and bottom 4's not excluded), oversized, vs expected 10x10 tight alternating 4/1/2 pattern cropped from middle.
 * Missed top-left translation after cropping (generated has centered zeros on left/top); buggy best_end indexing in find_max_sum_row_block likely includes/excludes wrong rows (e.g., train1 includes too many empty rows). Centered padding is a core mismatch—always shifts content incorrectly. No handling for multiple candidate blocks (always picks max but may pick wrong if ties). Function pad_to_square_size is incorrect/not relevant (causes all alignment failures; avoid in future). Overall, partial understanding of cropping but fails on alignment/padding, leading to no training passes. extract_objects-like logic isn't present but density cropping approximates it helpfully.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to be an uncropped or partially processed ~19x19 grid including multiple disconnected clusters (e.g., top scattered 3/5/4's, middle 3/4/5's, bottom 5's) without tight bounding, top-left alignment, or square padding; it has irregular leading zeros per row and preserves full input width/sparsity, suggesting the program applied loose row block selection but failed column crop or padding entirely (e.g., includes empty columns and distant 5's at bottom-right). This mismatches the pattern from trainings, where outputs should be small tight squares (~10-13 size) with only the densest central cluster (likely the middle 3/4/5 block here, cropped to ~8x10 then padded to 10x10 top-left). It looks like a near-input copy with some row selection but no real processing, so incorrect—likely due to indexing bugs including extra rows/columns and no translation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

    """Find the start and end indices of the longest sequence of significant non-empty rows."""
    # This is broken: uses a fixed >2 threshold and longest streak, which includes/excludes wrong rows (e.g., sparse border rows in ex1/2, flips row order in ex3).

    """Pad the cropped grid to a square by adding zero rows and columns centered."""
    # Generally correct for centering, but can produce oversized/off-center results if crop is wrong (e.g., 13x13 with uneven pads).
```
The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with different "colors" or values like 3,6,8) to extract the central or main non-zero content, crop it to a tight bounding box, and pad it symmetrically to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main block" should be identified as the longest consecutive sequence of rows with any non-zero elements, but care must be taken to exclude leading/trailing fully zero rows without including isolated zero rows within the block if they are structurally important (e.g., in example 1, internal zero positions are preserved but the block start/end must align precisely with the expected cropped area).
 * Column bounds must be computed only over the main row block, finding the minimal and maximal non-zero columns across those rows, but without expanding beyond the actual content—subtly, if a row in the block has no non-zeros (but is included in the block due to adjacency), its bounds should not affect min/max (current compute_col_bounds skips if l==-1, which is good, but may still misalign if block includes empty rows incorrectly).
 * Padding to square must be symmetric (centering the content) using zeros, first padding columns to match height, then rows to match the new width, but the target size is max(h,w) after cropping—issue is that if cropping misses parts, padding adds extra zeros in wrong places (e.g., in example 1, generated adds unintended non-zeros or shifts content left/right).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes with borders of zeros; the output should be square but retain the exact relative positions of non-zeros from the cropped area (e.g., example 2 shows misalignment in rows 3-4 where generated has [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] but expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], indicating column crop is too narrow or shifted).
 * Subtle element: Non-zeros represent "pixels" of different types (e.g., 3 might be borders, 6/8 fills), and the puzzle likely requires exact reproduction without altering values or introducing new ones—easy to miss that bounding box must be inclusive of all edge non-zeros but exclusive of outer empty space.
 * In example 3, the pattern alternates rows/columns, and generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips the starting row order, suggesting possible row reversal or reordering not handled (or wrong block detection includes extra).
 * General: Handle empty or all-zero grids by returning [[0]]; assume rectangular input; outputs are lists of lists, printed as rows.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), consider that main block detection uses row non-zero counts correctly but may over-include if zero rows are adjacent (e.g., example 1 generated includes row 0 with partial non-zeros? Wait, generated row 0 [0,0,3,0,3,...] suggests crop started too early or wrong min_c).

            curr_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_len - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This identifies the longest run of non-empty rows, which is core but subtly fails if multiple blocks exist or if zeros inside should be included—worked partially for block length but wrong start in examples.)

                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row min/max non-zero columns; essential for tight cropping, but only applied to main block rows.)

def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, num_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:

    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l != -1:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
(Combines row bounds for overall column crop; helpful but may yield empty if all rows in block are zero, leading to [[0]] fallback.)

(Core cropping function; works for slicing but inherits errors from bounds.)

    if current_size >= target_size:

    else:
        for r in range(len(lst)):
            lst[r] = [0] * left_or_top + lst[r] + [0] * right_or_bottom
    return lst
```
(Handles symmetric zero-padding for dimensions; useful and correct in isolation, but applied after faulty crop leads to misaligned content.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    size = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, False)  # pad columns
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, True)   # pad rows
    return cropped
```
(Overall squaring logic; helpful but order matters—padding columns first then rows ensures square, but if w > h initially, row padding adds to height correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the concept of finding a main non-zero block via row counts and cropping to bounding box, which works for isolating content in dense grids but fails on precise start/end (e.g., Train 1 generated starts crop too early, including extraneous left-shifted 3's in row 0 and mismatches like row 2 [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—shifted right by 1 and wrong values at ends; unknown why exact mismatch but likely min_c off by 1).
 * Train 2: Cropping works for row block but column bounds too narrow, omitting right-side elements (generated row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—missing two 3's on right, extra 3 on left); padding adds zeros incorrectly around incomplete crop.
 * Train 3: Block detection includes wrong rows, leading to row order flip or extra borders (generated row 0 [4,0,4,...] vs expected row 0 [0,4,0,...]—seems like it cropped starting from an offset row and didn't reverse or adjust for alternating pattern).
 * find_main_block is helpful but broken for cases with internal zero rows that should be included (it skips on any zero count row, potentially splitting blocks—e.g., if a structural zero row has count=0 but is part of the object, it's excluded).
 * get_row_bounds and compute_col_bounds are essential and mostly correct but fail when block has varying widths, leading to over-tight crops.
 * pad_dimension and pad_to_square are not broken and helpful for final output, but unhelpful if upstream crop is wrong (don't modify, but ensure crop inputs are accurate).
 * Overall, no extraction of "objects" like connected components was attempted, which might be needed if multiple disjoint parts exist (not in this code, but could be relevant for subtleties like ignoring outliers); current approach assumes single main block.
 * Train 1 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., generated row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—extra 3 and wrong positions, likely from faulty end_r or max_c).
 * No function for connected component analysis or object extraction, which might be unhelpful here since the puzzle seems bounding-box based, not segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped a central 5x13-ish pattern (rows ~3-9 with 3's,5's,4's) but padded excessively to 13x13 with large zero borders, shifting the content downward and not centering it properly (e.g., non-zeros start at row 3, but expected likely tighter crop to rows 4-8, columns ~3-10, padded to ~7x7 square embedded in zeros without the wide empty top/bottom). 
 * It includes symmetric 5's on left/right but mismatches internal structure (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] suggests incomplete column crop, missing connections like the 4 in row 6); this doesn't make sense as a clean extraction—likely wrong min_c/max_c (too wide on sides, too narrow vertically) and over-pads without preserving the "object" shape (e.g., the cross-like 3's and inner 4 seem distorted). 
 * To handle test case, account for multiple horizontal bars (top/bottom 5's, middle 3's) by ensuring block includes all connected non-zeros vertically, even if sparse; current code probably picks a partial block, leading to missing top/bottom elements.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid processing, where the goal is to identify the primary "object" or contiguous region of non-zero values in a 2D grid (likely representing an image or shape), crop it to its tight bounding box, and then pad the result to form a square grid while preserving the content. The output should be a transformed grid that isolates and normalizes the main feature for comparison or rendering.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of rows of integers (0 for empty/background, non-zero for filled/object pixels), and the "object" is defined by contiguous sequences of rows with non-zero counts, ignoring isolated or sparse rows.
 * Focus on the largest contiguous block of rows with any non-zeros to avoid including noise or separate components; subtle elements include handling rows with varying non-zero positions (e.g., irregular shapes) and ensuring column bounds are computed only over the selected rows.
 * Cropping must create a tight bounding box: min/max columns based on the first/last non-zero in each relevant row, but aggregated globally to avoid over-cropping jagged edges.
 * Padding to square should center the content (symmetric or near-symmetric padding with zeros) and handle cases where height and width differ, potentially starting from a 1x1 zero grid if empty.
 * Edge cases: empty grids, all-zero rows/columns, single-row/column objects, or grids where non-zeros don't align perfectly; avoid assuming uniform row lengths or non-negative values.
 * Non-zero values might represent different "colors" or intensities, but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding/cropping; preserve original values in the output.
 * Subtlety: Contiguous blocks reset on zero-count rows, so multiple objects might exist, but only the largest is selected—easy to miss if code doesn't properly scan for max length.
 * Global bounds must initialize correctly (e.g., min_col to infinity or grid width, max_col to -1) to handle rows with no non-zeros within the block.

(This correctly identifies the start/end of the largest run of non-zero-count rows; essential for isolating the main object vertically. Handles edge cases like all-zero grid returning (0,-1) or similar.)

        bounds.append((first, last))

(Effective for centering and squaring; handles empty grids and asymmetric padding well, preserving original values.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt demonstrates partial understanding of the puzzle by correctly identifying the need for contiguous row selection, per-row bounds, tight cropping, and square padding, but fails entirely due to a runtime error in all cases.
 * What worked: The vertical block detection (find_largest_contiguous_block) and per-row bounds (get_row_first_last) are logically sound and would isolate the main object if integrated properly; cropping and padding functions execute without issues in isolation.
 * What didn't work: The compute_global_bounds function is broken—it incorrectly initializes min_c as len(bounds[0][0]), where bounds[0][0] is an int (column index), causing "object of type 'int' has no len()" error on all inputs; this prevents any successful execution, so no outputs are generated for analysis.
 * No training examples or test passed; all resulted in the same execution error, indicating the bug blocks the entire pipeline.
 * The approach assumes the largest contiguous non-zero row block is the "object," which aligns with puzzle subtleties (e.g., ignoring noise), but untested due to crash.
 * Function compute_global_bounds is broken and unhelpful in its current form (causes crash; don't use without fixing initialization to something like min_c = float('inf') or grid width, and max_c = -1, then update only if l != -1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to the len() on int bug, so no actual grid is generated—completely incorrect and unusable for verification.
 * Expected test output should be a square-padded bounding box of the main contiguous object (e.g., if test input has a central shape spanning rows 2-5 and columns 3-7, output would crop to that 4x5 region, pad to 5x5 with zeros around, preserving non-zeros); the error prevents any match, and without seeing the input grid, it's unclear if the approach would otherwise align, but the crash confirms it does not produce a valid result.
 * This highlights the need to handle empty or edge rows in bounds aggregation without assuming non-empty tuples.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns (likely representing shapes, figures, or "objects" with pixel values like 3,5,6,8,4 indicating colors or types), where the goal is to extract the "main" or primary figure/object from the input grid, normalize its position (e.g., translate to top-left), compute a bounding box, and output a square grid representation padded with zeros, while ignoring or excluding noise, frames, or secondary elements. The output size is based on the max dimension of the extracted region, but the results suggest the extraction criteria (e.g., row selection, bounding box) are imprecise, leading to inclusions/exclusions of pixels that don't match expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain a "main" figure (dense cluster of non-zero pixels) surrounded by potential noise, frames, or disconnected elements (e.g., sparse lines or dots outside the core shape); the program must identify and isolate only the primary connected or consecutive component, excluding outer frames or isolated pixels.
 * Y-range selection is critical: use consecutive rows with non-zero sums, but prioritize the block with maximum total non-zero pixels to avoid noise; however, subtle disconnected parts (e.g., small protrusions or separate blobs) may need inclusion if part of the main structure, or exclusion if they are artifacts.
 * Bounding box computation must tightly fit the main figure's extent (min/max x/y of non-zeros in selected rows), but avoid expanding to include frame-like borders; translation shifts to (0,0) origin, and output is a square of side max(width, height) of the bbox, padded with zeros—do not return the original n x n size unless s == n.
 * Subtleties include handling asymmetric shapes (e.g., figures not centered), multiple potential "main" blocks (select largest by sum or area), and ensuring no pixel values are altered during extraction/translation—only positions change.
 * Noise handling: Grids may have zero-rows or sparse rows above/below/around the main figure; do not include them in the y-range or bbox unless they connect to the main structure.
 * Output must preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within the extracted region; mismatches often occur in top/bottom rows (e.g., extra 3s included as noise) or side alignments (e.g., shifted 8s or 6s).
 * Consider connected components: The main figure may not be fully rectangular; use row_bounds to find per-row min/max x, but aggregate carefully to avoid over-expansion.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return zero-filled n x n; if no main block, output zeros; varying grid sizes (10x10 or 13x13) mean s can be < n, leading to smaller outputs implicitly padded in display.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect y-range (including noise rows) or bbox (missing/extruding parts), resulting in shifted or incomplete figures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several modular functions for row analysis and extraction, which are partially useful for identifying and isolating regions but need refinement for accurate main figure selection (e.g., better y-range logic or component detection). No new types are defined, but Tuple[int, int] for bounds and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for pixels (y,x,value) are effective for handling positions and values.

The main `program` function composes these but is flawed in y-range/bbox selection; no explicit object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) is present, which might be needed for complex shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (all training examples failed); it correctly implements modular extraction/translation/padding but fails on core selection logic.
 * What worked: Pixel extraction preserves values; translation to (0,0) normalizes position; square padding handles varying bbox sizes; row_sums and row_bounds efficiently identify dense regions without full scans.
 * What didn't work: Y-range selection via max-sum consecutive rows includes noise (e.g., top/bottom sparse rows with 3s in train1), leading to bbox that captures extras; no handling for disconnected components or frames, causing over-inclusion; output size s often matches n but with misplaced pixels due to wrong min_y/max_y.
 * Train1: Generated includes extra 3s in row0 (positions 2,4) and row12 (3s at 3,4), but expected has 3s at 3 and 10 in row0, and 3s at 5 and 7 in row12; inner figure (8s,6s) is shifted/missing parts (e.g., generated row2 has 8s at 2-3 but expected at 3; row10 has 8s at 8-9 but expected at 9 missing); overall, figure is vertically expanded with noise, horizontally misaligned (unknown reason, possibly bbox min_x too low).
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 at 3 but expected all 0s except row1 3 at 6; row3 has 3s at 1-2 but expected 3 at 2; row4 has 5 at 0,3 at 2 but expected 5 at 0,3s at 1-2; row5 matches somewhat but row6 has 4s missing in expected positions; figure is incomplete/shifted rightward, with extra 3s in noise rows (e.g., row1), suggesting wrong y-range including top noise.
 * Train3: Generated row0/1 are [4,0,4,...]/[0,4,0,...] but expected swapped to [0,4,0,...]/[4,0,4,...], indicating possible rotation or frame misextraction; inner 1s/2s are misplaced (e.g., generated row2 has 1 at 5 but expected row2 all 0s except 1s at 3-4; row4 has 2s at 4-5 but expected row4 2s at 4-5 ok, but surrounding 1s wrong); frame is included but inverted, inner figure vertically shifted down by ~1 row (unknown reason, likely y-range starts too early).
 * Function `get_main_bbox` is helpful but broken when y-range is noisy (propagates errors); `find_main_y_range` is essential but insufficient (needs connectivity or size threshold); no unhelpful functions, but the composition in `program` assumes single main block—add component detection for multi-blob grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of normalization but misses subtle noise exclusion and precise component isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it extracts a partial figure (5s on sides, 3s/4s in middle) but places it starting from row1 (with row0 as [0s,3,3,0s] like noise or bottom fragment), repeats the pattern in rows1-2/4-5 but inverts or shifts (e.g., row2 has 3s at 4-8 but test input row? has different), adds isolated 3 in row6 middle, then pads with 7+ zero rows— this suggests wrong y-range (included top noise, excluded bottom?), incomplete bbox (missing left/right alignments, e.g., 5s at 0-1 and 11-12 but 3s not centered), and over-padding without centering. Expected likely a tight square of the central cross-like figure (3s horizontal, 4s vertical-ish, framed by 5s) translated to top-left without extras, possibly 7x7 or similar s<13, but output bloats to 13x13 with misplaced elements (e.g., duplicated rows 1/5 and 2/4 indicate loop error or wrong min_y). It fails to isolate the main "plus" shape, including apparent noise 3s, and doesn't match a clean normalized output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear **in every train example** (inputs 1-3 and their corresponding outputs). I focused only on properties like color, holes, pixels, bbox (position and size), and spatial relations (e.g., overlap or containment) that show clear, direct effects or links (e.g., one property influencing another's transformation or placement). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone small blocks with no overlapping bboxes or shared properties across examples) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., hole counts, which are 1 in train 1 but 0 in trains 2 and 3) are not included. Where a connection involves an unexplainable transformation, it is noted as unknown.

- **Color groups to pixel counts (preservation effect)**: Components grouped by color have their individual pixel counts preserved in the output for matching components (e.g., a specific component with pixels=N in input appears with pixels=N in output). This is consistent across all examples, indicating color acts as an identifier that links input components to their output counterparts, affecting which pixels are retained during transformation. Examples:
  - Train 1: Pink component (pixels=12) preserved; large Maroon (pixels=37) preserved; small Maroon (pixels=3) preserved.
  - Train 2: Yellow component (pixels=6) preserved; each Green component (pixels=5) preserved individually.
  - Train 3: Red component (pixels=4) preserved; multiple Yellow components (pixels=1 each) preserved individually.
  - Note: Total pixels per color may vary slightly due to ignored peripheral elements (see below), but individual component links hold.

- **Bbox size (width/height derived from [x1,y1,x2,y2]) to shape preservation**: For components where input bbox defines a clear rectangular extent (width = x2 - x1 + 1, height = y2 - y1 + 1), the output bbox preserves the exact width and height dimensions. This links shape properties to transformation rules, ensuring geometric form affects repositioning without scaling. Consistent in trains 1 and 2 (where multi-pixel components exist); in train 3, single-pixel components trivially preserve 1x1 size, making it consistent across all.
  - Train 1: Pink input bbox size (5x5) -> output (5x5); large Maroon (9x9) -> (9x9); small Maroon (2x2) -> (2x2).
  - Train 2: Yellow (3x3) -> (3x3); Greens (e.g., 4x2 or 2x4) -> matching (4x2 or 2x4) individually.
  - Train 3: All listed components are 1x1 or small rectangles (e.g., Red 2x2) -> output matches (e.g., Red 2x2).

- **Position (bbox coordinates) to repositioning (unknown transformation)**: Input bbox positions directly influence output positions, with all main components repositioned relative to a top-left normalization (outputs start from [0,0] bounding area). This is a consistent link (position affects movement), but the exact transformation rule (e.g., shift amount or sorting logic) is unknown and varies (e.g., uniform left-shift in train 1, non-uniform in trains 2 and 3). No forced explanation; noted as unknown effect on final coordinates.
  - Applies to all main components across examples (e.g., central/large elements move into a compact [0,max] grid).

- **Peripheral small components (high y-position) to ignoring (exclusion effect)**: Small, standalone components at high y-positions (y >=15) with low pixels (1-2) and no bbox overlap with main structures are consistently excluded from outputs in trains 1 and 2, linking their position to non-inclusion in transformation. In train 3, no such peripheral components exist (all interact via repositioning), but the pattern holds as "no exclusion needed" for consistency. This affects overall pixel totals but not main component links.
  - Train 1: Small Maroon (y16-17, pixels=2), Green (y18, pixels=1), Pink (y18, pixels=2) ignored.
  - Train 2: Small Green (y15, pixels=1), Yellow (y16, pixels=1) ignored.
  - Train 3: No high-y isolates; all repositioned (consistent with no exclusion required).

No other obvious connections (e.g., hole count -> color change, color -> hole creation, or specific overlaps like containment) are consistent across **every** example—train 1 shows some containment (e.g., Pink inside Green bbox), but trains 2 and 3 lack it for main components. Specific shape silhouettes (e.g., lines vs. blocks) vary too much to link consistently without forcing unrelated patterns.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 13:28:14] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract and normalize the core "image" or content from sparse 2D grids filled with numbers representing pixels or symbols, likely by cropping out surrounding empty (zero) space and centering/padding the result into a square format while preserving the relative positions and asymmetries of the non-zero elements. The goal is to produce a tight, centered bounding box of the active content without distorting shapes, but the current program over-crops or misaligns columns/rows, leading to shifted or incomplete representations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids represent visual patterns (e.g., shapes or symbols made of numbers like 3,8,6,5,4,1), and the output must preserve exact relative positions of non-zeros, including asymmetries (e.g., in training example 1, the top row's 3s are not symmetrically placed, and internal "gaps" like zero rows or columns within the content must not be cropped out if they are structural).
 * Cropping should use the global min/max row and column indices of all non-zero cells across the entire grid, not just the longest contiguous block of non-empty rows—this misses disconnected or gapped components (e.g., borders or separate objects).
 * Padding must be centered (equal or near-equal on both sides) to make a square of side max(height, width) of the cropped grid, but only after accurate cropping; over-padding or incorrect min/max leads to shifted content.
 * Empty rows/columns on the borders should be fully removed, but internal empties (e.g., in training example 2's row 1 or 8) are part of the design and must stay.
 * Subtle asymmetries in expected outputs (e.g., training example 1's bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] vs. generated [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]; training example 3's row orders are swapped in places) suggest the puzzle may involve orientation or specific "framing" rules, but cropping must not reorder or flip.
 * All non-zero values (regardless of their number, e.g., 3 as border, 8/6 as fills) define the bounds; zeros inside are intentional spaces, not to be filled.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 13x13 for train1, 10x10 for others), and output should match input dimensions if square, but centered padding ensures squareness.
 * Potential multiple "objects" (e.g., borders around inner shapes in train3), so bounding box must encompass all, not just the densest area.
 * Edge cases: Fully empty grids return [[0]]; uneven padding (e.g., (s - dim) // 2 for one side) to handle odd differences.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is useful for identifying non-empty rows but insufficient alone for global bounds; better for scanning density.)

```python
def first_nonzero(row: List[int]) -> int:
    for j in range(len(row)):
        if row[j] != 0:
            return j
    return len(row)
```
(Helpful for left-edge detection per row; extend to global min_col by taking min over all rows' first_nonzero.)

```python
def last_nonzero(row: List[int]) -> int:
    for j in range(len(row) - 1, -1, -1):
        if row[j] != 0:
            return j
    return -1
```
(Helpful for right-edge detection per row; extend to global max_col by taking max over all rows' last_nonzero.)
```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is good: compute global min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c from all non-zeros
    # Then crop: [row[min_c:max_c+1] for row in g[start:end+1]]
    # Then pad to s = max(h, w) centered, as done (pad_left = (s - w)//2, etc.)
    # But replace contiguous block logic with full scan:
    n, m = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    min_r, max_r = n, -1
    min_c, max_c = m, -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, i)
                max_r = max(max_r, i)
                min_c = min(min_c, j)
                max_c = max(max_c, j)
    if max_r < 0:
        return [[0]]
    cropped = [row[min_c:max_c+1] for row in g[min_r:max_r+1]]
    # Rest of padding logic as-is
```
(This improved version uses full bounding box; original's contiguous rows fail on gapped content.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies non-empty rows and pads to a square centered, which works for basic symmetry and size normalization (e.g., outputs are square-ish and zero-padded).
 * However, it fails to compute accurate column bounds (min_c/max_c) by only scanning a contiguous row block, leading to left-shifted content (e.g., in train1, generated starts 3s at column 2 instead of 3, and includes extra left zeros while missing right placements like the final 3 in row 0).
 * Longest contiguous non-empty rows logic ignores global content, cropping out top/bottom elements (e.g., train1 generated omits or shifts the asymmetric 3s in expected row 0 and 12; train2 generated places 3s wrong in row 1 and shifts inner 4s/3s).
 * In train3, row order and positions are mangled (e.g., generated keeps border-like 4s but misaligns inner 1/2 shapes, swapping some row patterns entirely compared to expected, possibly due to incorrect row start/end).
 * Function `count_nonzeros` is helpful for row density but not used effectively for global bounds.
 * Functions `first_nonzero` and `last_nonzero` are useful per-row tools but underutilized—program takes min/max over a subset of rows only, causing incomplete column spans (e.g., misses rightmost 3s in train1 row 11).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., separate shapes like borders vs. fills) attempted, but may not be needed; simple bounding box suffices if global.
 * Padding works partially (centered zeros added correctly), but since crop is wrong, final output has artifacts like extra internal zeros or shifts (e.g., train2 generated has 3s in row1 where expected has zeros, and misplaces 4s).
 * Train1 mismatches include: row0 generated [0,0,3,0,3,...] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,...3,...] (shifted left, wrong positions); row2 generated has 8s starting too left; row10 generated [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,3,0] (missing right 8, extra left alignment).
 * Train2 mismatches: row1 generated [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0] (3 too left); row3 generated [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5] (extra left 3s, missing right 3s); inner 4s shifted.
 * Train3 mismatches: Entire structure wrong—generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips row patterns (e.g., expected row0 [0,4,0,...] vs generated row1; inner 1/2 blobs misaligned, e.g., row4 generated [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4] with different zero placements).
 * No reordering or flipping attempted, which might be needed for train3's apparent rotation, but likely not—mismatches are from bad cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it excessively pads with zero rows (e.g., rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zero, but content starts at row3 with partial 3s, suggesting over-removal of top rows or wrong row bounds; expected likely crops tighter to rows with 5/3/4 content).
 * Content is somewhat preserved (e.g., central 3s and 4 in rows 4-8 match patterns like train1/2), but columns are shifted left (e.g., row4 [5,5,0,3,3,...] starts 5s too early vs. likely expected border-like spacing), and right side has uneven 5s, missing potential asymmetry.
 * Too many full-zero rows indicate the contiguous block logic failed again (test input has zero rows at top/bottom, but program may have cropped to inner block, excluding framing 5s properly).
 * Inner structure (e.g., 3s forming a shape with 4 inside, 5s as border) is visible but misaligned, e.g., row5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] has 3s not centered; does not match a clean, tight crop—likely needs global min/max to include all 5/3/4 without extra left/right zeros.
 * Overall, it partially captures the "object" but distorts positions, similar to training failures; correct output should be a centered square with exact non-zero placements, no excessive zero borders beyond minimal padding.

[2025-10-03 13:28:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 13:50:07] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to extract the "main content" of a sparse grid (likely an image or diagram represented as numbers) by cropping to a tight bounding box around all non-zero elements and then padding the result to a centered square of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, using zero-padding. The output must exactly match the expected grid structure, including precise positioning of non-zeros after padding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping must capture *all* non-zero elements in the grid without excluding any, even if they are separated by empty (all-zero) rows or columns within the content area—do not assume content is in a single consecutive block.
 * Padding must be centered: for a subgrid of height h and width w, pad to size s = max(h, w), with vertical padding split as evenly as possible (top_pad = (s - h) // 2, bottom_pad = s - h - top_pad) and similarly for horizontal (left/right), ensuring zeros are added symmetrically around the content.
 * The bounding box for rows should be the minimal and maximal row indices containing *any* non-zero (i.e., overall min_r and max_r across the entire grid where sum(row) > 0), not the longest consecutive sequence of non-empty rows, as empty rows inside the content must still be included if they are between min_r and max_r.
 * For columns, the bounding box should similarly be the minimal and maximal column indices with *any* non-zero in the entire grid (or equivalently in the row-bounded subgrid), to avoid shifting or excluding edge content.
 * Grids may have outer empty rows/columns that should be cropped out, but inner empty rows/columns within the bounding box must be preserved as part of the content.
 * Output must be a list of lists (exact 2D structure), with each inner list being a flat row of integers—no formatting errors like mixing list-of-lists with separate lists.
 * Subtleties include handling cases where h != w (asymmetric padding), grids with isolated non-zeros (e.g., borders or sparse elements), and ensuring no artificial shifting occurs during extraction (e.g., due to incorrect min_c/max_c calculation).
 * All training examples failed, suggesting the consecutive-rows approach fragments content; the test output's weird formatting (mixing [] and [[ ]]) indicates a printing or return issue in the program.
 * No evidence of needing to "extract objects" like blobs or connected components—it's purely bounding box + padding, not semantic analysis.
 * Consider overall sparsity: grids have lots of zeros, so sum(row) > 0 is a reliable non-empty check, but verify with any(g[i][j] != 0 for j in row).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current attempt's functions are mostly on the right track for extraction and padding but broken in row selection; here's a refined version of key helpers (unhelpful ones like find_longest_consecutive_nonempty_rows should be discarded):

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_overall_bounding_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the minimal and maximal row indices containing at least one non-zero element (overall bounding, includes inner empties)."""
    n = len(g)
    nonempty_rows = [i for i in range(n) if any(cell != 0 for cell in g[i])]
    if not nonempty_rows:
        return 0, n - 1  # Edge case: all empty, return full grid
    return min(nonempty_rows), max(nonempty_rows)

def find_overall_bounding_columns(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the minimal and maximal column indices containing at least one non-zero in the entire grid."""
    n_rows = len(g)
    if n_rows == 0:
        return 0, 0
    n_cols = len(g[0])
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(n_rows):
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_c = min(min_c, j)
                max_c = max(max_c, j)
    if max_c == -1:
        return 0, n_cols - 1  # All empty
    return min_c, max_c
```

```python
def create_padded_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Extract the subgrid from the given bounds and pad to a square of side max(h, w), centered with zeros."""
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    size = max(h, w)
    top_pad = (size - h) // 2
    bottom_pad = size - h - top_pad
    left_pad = (size - w) // 2
    right_pad = size - w - left_pad
    # Extract subgrid rows
    subgrid = [[g[min_r + i][min_c + j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    # Horizontally pad each row
    padded_rows = [[ [0] * left_pad + subgrid[i] + [0] * right_pad for i in range(h) ]]
    # Vertically pad with zero rows
    output = [[0] * size for _ in range(top_pad)] + padded_rows[0] + [[0] * size for _ in range(bottom_pad)]

```

The function find_longest_consecutive_nonempty_rows from the attempt is broken/not helpful (it ignores inner empty rows and picks only the longest block, leading to incomplete content; discard it). find_bounding_columns is mostly helpful but should use overall grid, not row-limited. create_padded_subgrid is helpful but has a minor bug in the attempt's version (padded_sub uses list comprehension incorrectly, leading to nested lists; fixed above). No need for object extraction functions, as the puzzle is geometric cropping, not component analysis.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on cropping to the longest consecutive non-empty rows, which worked for identifying a dense block but failed by excluding potential inner empty rows or outer content, resulting in shifted or incomplete grids in all training examples.
 * Padding logic was mostly correct (centered zeros to square), but extraction errors propagated, causing mismatches like extra/missing non-zeros or wrong positions (e.g., in Train 1, generated row 0 has 3's at positions 2 and 4, but expected has them at 3 and 11; unknown why exactly, but likely due to wrong min_c shifting the subgrid left).
 * In Train 1, the generated grid mismatched expected in multiple rows: e.g., row 2 generated [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3] (leading 3's missing, trailing 3 added; row 5 generated [0,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,0,8,8,3,3] vs expected [3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,0,8,8,3,0] (leading zeros instead of 3's); row 9 generated [3,3,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,3,0] vs expected [0,3,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,3,0] (extra 8's and wrong positions).
 * In Train 2, generated mismatched in row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5] (extra 3's, missing trailing 3 and 5 shift); row 4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs expected [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0] (missing 4's, wrong positions for 3's); the generated seems to have cropped too narrowly on columns, excluding right-edge content.
 * In Train 3, generated row 2 [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] (leading 4 misplaced, missing inner 1's); row 5 [0,4,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,4] vs expected [4,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,4,0] (wrong starting elements, shifted 1's and 4's); suggests incorrect row/column bounds, possibly treating border patterns as separate blocks.
 * All attempts (just this one) produced 2D lists correctly sized to square but with content errors; no successful training passes, indicating core row selection flaw.
 * Function find_longest_consecutive_nonempty_rows is incorrect and not relevant (it splits on inner empties, don't use it); find_bounding_columns is partially helpful but row-limited; create_padded_subgrid has nesting bug in horizontal padding.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it has inconsistent formatting (some rows as flat [0,0,...] lists, others as [[0,0,...]] sublists, and stray empty rows like [0,0,...] repeated), suggesting a return or printing bug in the program rather than a clean 2D list.
 * Content appears partially cropped (e.g., middle rows show 3's, 4's, 5's in a pattern, with empty top/bottom), but it's not centered-padded to a proper square—e.g., row with [[5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5]] has 13 elements, but surrounding empties are not symmetrically padded, and the overall structure mixes 1D/2D, making it invalid.
 * It seems to have applied the consecutive-rows logic, capturing a central block but missing precise bounds (e.g., the 3's and 5's look like borders, but positions don't align symmetrically); without expected test output, it's unclear if content matches, but the messiness indicates it won't pass any validation.
 * To handle test case, ensure overall bounding (not consecutive) to capture full border-like patterns, and fix output to always return List[List[int]] without nesting errors.

[2025-10-03 13:50:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 14:13:55] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation, where the goal is to identify the core non-zero content (likely an "image" or object formed by numbers representing colors/shapes) within a larger grid that may include borders, frames, or extraneous zeros, then crop, pad, and center it into a square format while preserving the relative positions and values of the inner elements. The outputs suggest a need to tightly bound the main block, handle irregular shapes without distortion, and ensure precise alignment/padding to match expected layouts, possibly accounting for symmetric frames or multiple components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids contain numbers (e.g., 3 for borders/frames, 6/8/4/5 for inner shapes/objects) separated by zeros; the "main block" is the contiguous or visually central non-zero region, but not necessarily the absolute minimal bounding box if it includes frame elements that should be partially retained or adjusted.
 * Padding must create a square (side length based on max of height/width of the block), with even distribution on all sides, but the current approach over-pads or misaligns, leading to shifted elements (e.g., borders not symmetric).
 * Subtle asymmetries in inner shapes (e.g., 8's and 6's in train 1 forming irregular blobs) must be preserved exactly; the program distorts by slicing incorrectly or assuming uniform rows.
 * Frames (e.g., 3's in train 1/2, 4's/5's in train 2/3) seem integral but need selective inclusion/exclusion—generated outputs include full frames but misplace inner details, suggesting the block should encompass frame + content but center precisely.
 * Handle multiple disconnected components (e.g., train 1 has 6's and 8's not fully contiguous); the longest consecutive row span works partially but fails on column bounding if rows have varying non-zero extents.
 * Zeros inside the block (holes in shapes) must remain; padding adds outer zeros only, but current code adds uneven pads, causing shifts (e.g., train 1 generated top row has 3's too leftward vs. expected).
 * Grid size varies (13x13 in train 1, 10x10 in others); output must match input dimensions or expand to square, but examples show same size with internal rearrangement/padding.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs sometimes swap or reorder rows/columns slightly (e.g., train 1 row 2 expected matches generated row 2, but row 3 has 8's shifted right; train 3 borders are inverted in positions), hinting at possible rotation, mirroring, or canonical orientation.
 * For test input: Central cross-like shape with 3's (horizontal/vertical bars), framed by 5's on sides and bottom; main block spans rows 3-9, columns 0-12, but with sparse 4's—output should center this into square, preserving the 3-bar structure without over-padding edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_main_block(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]:
    """
    Attempts to find bounding box of non-empty rows/columns.
    Works for identifying row span (consecutive non-empty rows) but fails on precise column bounds per row,
    leading to wide/over-inclusive w that causes misalignment.
    """
    # (existing code as provided; partially useful for row detection but needs per-row min/max refinement)
    pass
```

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Crops to bounding box, pads to square with centered content.
    Helpful for basic structure but broken in padding calculation (e.g., pad_h/pad_w integer div floors unevenly,
    and row_slice assumes uniform width across h, ignoring varying row lengths).
    Not sufficient alone—needs better bounding and possible row/column reordering.
    """
    # (existing code as provided; core idea is right but implementation distorts shapes)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies a vertical span of non-empty rows (e.g., train 1 uses rows 2-11, close to expected) and computes a square side s = max(h, w), which works for sizing.
 * What worked: Padding adds zeros correctly in concept, and output remains same dimensions; handles empty grids edge case.
 * What didn't: Bounding box is too loose on columns (uses global min/max_cs across rows, but rows have varying extents, leading to extra zeros sliced in, e.g., train 1 generated row 3 has 8's starting too early vs. expected shifted right).
 * Train 1: Generated includes full 3-frame but shifts inner 8/6 shapes left/up (e.g., row 3 generated [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs. expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...]—3's protrude incorrectly, and bottom rows mismatch in 8 placements, possibly due to uneven pad_w=1 or wrong min_c=1).
 * Train 2: Generated border 5's/3's misaligned (e.g., row 4 generated [5,0,3,0,4,...] vs. expected [5,3,3,0,4,...]—inner 3's and 4's shifted, missing right-side 3's; seems to crop too narrowly on columns).
 * Train 3: Generated inverts border pattern (starts with [4,0,4,...] on row 0 vs. expected [0,4,0,...]), and inner 1/2 shapes are distorted (e.g., row 5 generated [0,4,1,0,2,...] vs. expected [4,0,0,0,2,...]—rows appear swapped or columns offset by 1).
 * Overall: Program assumes rectangular uniform slice, but shapes are irregular; no handling for frame detection or orientation—leads to all INCORRECT.
 * find_main_block is partially helpful for row spans but broken for columns (min/max_cs aggregates wrongly, inflating w); use but refine with per-row trimming.
 * No other functions tried; this attempt shows basic understanding of cropping/padding but misses shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output pads the entire grid to 13x13 (all zeros except inner), centering a block around rows 4-8 with 3's and 5's/4's, but it looks incorrect: it retains full-width 5's on sides but squishes the central 3-bar structure (e.g., row 5 generated [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] vs. what should be a tighter centered cross preserving sparse 4's and gaps—expected likely has more even padding, no side 5's bleeding into center, and 4's unshifted).
 * Differences: Over-pads top/bottom with 3 empty rows each (reasonable for square but misaligns if s computed wrong); inner 3's form a plus-sign but generated row 6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] keeps side 5's too wide, distorting the frame—expected should crop 5's as borders and center only the 3/4 core, possibly rotating to match train patterns.
 * Does not make sense: The output treats 5's as part of main block (w too wide), leading to asymmetric padding; subtle 4's (single cell?) are preserved but offset, hinting program misses isolated elements—likely needs component detection, not just bounding box.
 * To handle test: Refine column bounds to tightest per row, exclude outer frames if they are uniform (e.g., detect 5's as border), and ensure s pads minimally while keeping shape intact.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 14:13:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract or crop a subgrid from a larger input grid (likely square, with dimensions around 10-13 based on examples) that captures the "core" or primary patterned object(s) formed by non-zero numbers, while excluding border padding, empty rows/columns, or extraneous elements. The output should be a rectangular or square subgrid that matches the expected structure exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of the numbers (which seem to represent colors, labels, or connected components like blobs/shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid contains non-zero numbers (e.g., 3,8,6 in train1; 5,3,4 in train2; 4,1,2 in train3) arranged in patterns that likely form distinct "objects" or shapes, surrounded by zeros acting as background or padding; the task is to isolate the bounding box of the main object(s), but not just any dense area—subtleties include handling irregular shapes, multiple components, and ensuring the crop aligns precisely with the expected layout (e.g., including specific zero placements within the object).
 * Outputs must match the expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected is 13 rows x 13 columns, but generated is 12x12; train2 expected 10x10, generated 10x10 but content wrong; train3 expected 10x10 with rotated/shifted elements, generated 9x9?); mismatches in size indicate failure to detect the correct span or padding.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have "borders" or frames (e.g., 3's outlining in train1, 5's in train2/train3), internal zeros that are part of the shape (not to be cropped out), and asymmetric placements (e.g., objects not centered, with uneven padding); vertical and horizontal cropping must consider the minimal bounding box that includes all relevant non-zeros without trimming internal structure.
 * Connected components or spans: Non-zeros form blobs (e.g., 8's as one shape, 6's as another in train1), and the crop should encompass the largest or primary blob(s); however, it's not just max span—expected outputs shift or select specific alignments (e.g., train1 expected starts columns later, includes extra row/column with sparse 3's).
 * Padding and zeros: Expected outputs retain some outer zeros if they are part of the frame (e.g., train1 expected has leading/trailing zeros in rows), but exclude large empty borders; generated outputs often over-crop or misalign, removing necessary zeros or adding incorrect padding.
 * Multiple objects: Grids may have hierarchical or adjacent shapes (e.g., train1 has 3-frame around 8/6 innards; train2 has 5-frame with internal 3/4; train3 has 4-frame with internal 1/2), requiring the crop to include the enclosing frame without fragmenting internals.
 * Vertical selection: Not all rows with max horizontal span are equal; expected selects a contiguous block but shifted (e.g., train1 generated starts at row 1, expected includes row 0 and 12 with sparse elements).
 * Horizontal alignment: Left edge is not always the global min column; it must align to the frame's start (e.g., train1 generated left=1 based on min_first, but expected left=3 with more leading zeros).
 * Density vs. structure: Summing non-zero counts for vertical selection works partially but fails when multiple candidate blocks have similar sums; expected prioritizes structural integrity over max density.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero rows/columns in output only if they frame the object (e.g., train3 expected has patterned borders); test input has scattered 5/3/4 patterns, likely needing a crop that captures a central cross-like or framed shape.
 * Overall: The puzzle emphasizes exact reproduction of the "visible" core image, possibly from a larger canvas with margins; failures often stem from incorrect bounding box calculation, ignoring frame elements, or wrong vertical/horizontal slicing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes some potentially useful primitives for analysis, but they are flawed in application.

```python
from typing import List

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is helpful for measuring row density, useful for vertical block selection, but insufficient alone as it ignores column-wise or structural alignment.)

```python
def get_span(row: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    first = None
    for i in range(n):
        if row[i] != 0:
            first = i
            break
    if first is None:
        return 0
    last = None
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if row[i] != 0:
            last = i
            break
    return last - first + 1 if last is not None else 0
```
(This computes the width of the non-zero segment in a row, helpful for identifying max pattern size horizontally, but misses multi-segment rows or frame detection; could be extended for column spans.)

No other types or tools are provided; future attempts might benefit from functions to find bounding boxes (min/max row/col with non-zeros), detect connected components (e.g., flood fill for blobs), or compute minimal enclosing rectangle for specific values (e.g., trace 3-frames).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt provided, which attempts a cropping strategy based on max horizontal spans and vertical density sums, but all training examples fail due to dimensional mismatches (e.g., train1 generated 12x12 vs. expected 13x13) and content errors (e.g., wrong left alignment, missing sparse frame rows).
 * Worked partially: Horizontal span detection identifies a reasonable size (e.g., captures width of main patterns), and vertical density sum selects a dense block (e.g., train1 generated includes core 8/6 rows 2-10, which overlap expected).
 * Did not work: Over-relies on max span rows for left alignment (e.g., train1 min_first=1 from row1's 3, but expected left=3 to include more padding and align frame); vertical selection picks wrong start (e.g., train1 best_start=1, skipping row0's sparse 3's and excluding row12); adds incorrect padding in rows (e.g., train1 generated pads short rows with zeros on right, but expected has exact 13 cols without padding); ignores overall grid symmetry or frame tracing.
 * Train1: Generated shifts left edge too far left (starts at col1 with 0,0,3 vs. expected col3 with 0,0,0,3), includes wrong row block (rows1-12, missing top/bottom sparse rows, extra dense row10 that's not in expected block), and trims to 12 cols (loses right 3's); differences include misplaced 8's/6's (e.g., generated row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs. expected row2: [0,3,0,8,0,8,...])—unknown why exact positions mismatch, possibly due to wrong left/right calc.
 * Train2: Generated has correct 10x10 size but wrong content (e.g., row3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—generated fills internal zeros incorrectly, shifts 3's/4's leftward); includes row1 as [0,0,0,3,...] but expected has it as empty-ish [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]; vertical block starts too early, capturing wrong frame alignment.
 * Train3: Generated appears 9x9 (rows listed as 9, but code aims for size=9?), with shifted borders (e.g., row0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] vs. expected row9: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—seems rotated or flipped incorrectly); internal 1/2 placements wrong (e.g., row4: [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4] vs. expected row4: [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—generated adds extra leading 4's, loses padding); function get_span likely picks wrong max_s (9 vs. expected 10, trimming borders).
 * The core program(g) function is broken for dimension handling (assumes square crop of max_s, pads incorrectly, selects suboptimal vertical block); count_nonzeros and get_span are helpful but not sufficient—need better bounding box or frame detection; avoid overusing density sums without structural checks, as it leads to dense-but-misaligned crops.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears malformed/incomplete for the puzzle: it has 13 rows but varying lengths (some 13 elems, but structure is ragged); includes large empty rows (e.g., row2 all zeros, row10 all zeros), which likely shouldn't be in a core crop unless framing, but here they disrupt the pattern; the visible parts show a scattered 5/3/4 arrangement (e.g., row4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] seems like a horizontal bar, row6: [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] with a 4 insert), but it's vertically spread with empties, suggesting wrong vertical block selection (probably picked a non-contiguous or padded block including borders).
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Assuming test input has a central framed object with 5's as outer, 3's/4's inner (based on scattered non-zeros around center), expected should be a tight ~9-11x13 crop centering the cross/bar patterns without full empty rows (e.g., exclude top/bottom empties, align left to first 5/3 col ~4, right to last ~12); generated includes too many leading/trailing zeros per row and wrong row selection (e.g., starts with sparse row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0], but likely expected skips to denser block starting row4); it fails to capture a cohesive shape, outputting a "smeared" version with isolated elements—does not make sense as a core extraction, missing subtle frame alignment (e.g., 5's not properly bordering 3/4's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely binary or simple numeric grids representing shapes or objects), where the goal is to identify and extract the "main" contiguous block or object (defined by non-zero cells), crop it to its minimal bounding box, and then pad it symmetrically to form a square grid of appropriate size, preserving the object's structure for further puzzle-solving or recognition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of rows of integers (likely 0s for empty space and non-zero values like 1s for filled cells in an object or shape).
 * Identify the "main block" by finding the row with the highest density of non-zero cells, then extend contiguously up and down to include all adjacent non-zero rows, assuming the object is a single connected vertical block without gaps.
 * After selecting rows, compute the tightest column bounds across those rows by finding the global min/first non-zero column and max/last non-zero column, ignoring fully zero rows or columns.
 * Crop to the bounding box (subgrid of selected rows and columns), then pad with zeros to make it square: first pad columns to match the max of height/width, centering the content; then pad rows similarly if needed.
 * Edge cases include empty grids (return a single [[0]] or similar minimal square), grids where the object doesn't span all columns/rows, or where non-zero counts are zero (handle gracefully without errors).
 * Subtlety: Padding must be centered (equal or floor/ceil split on both sides) to maintain visual symmetry, and the final size should be the max of the cropped height/width, not hardcoded.
 * Assume the grid is rectangular (all rows same length), but the object may not fill the entire grid—avoid including sparse or disconnected parts.
 * Non-zero cells might vary in value (e.g., different numbers for shading), but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding and cropping.
 * Potential for multiple objects: The code assumes one main block via max density row, but puzzles might require selecting the largest/densest without merging disconnected components.

These functions handle row density calculation, block selection, per-row bounds, cropping, and centered padding effectively, and can be reused or minimally fixed for future attempts.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Compute global min first and max last over selected rows."""
    min_c = len(bounds[0][0]) if bounds else 0  # Use a large number  # BROKEN: bounds[0][0] is int, len(int) errors

            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
This function is broken due to attempting len() on an int (should initialize min_c to a large value like len(g[0]) instead of len(bounds[0][0])), causing runtime errors on all inputs; it cannot be used as-is and needs fixing to compute column bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the core logic of finding a dense contiguous row block via non-zero counts and extending boundaries, which aligns with extracting a main object.
 * Row and column bound calculation (via get_row_bounds) works in principle for tight cropping, and padding functions ensure centered square output, which seems essential for visual puzzles.
 * However, the entire program fails to execute due to a bug in compute_col_bounds (len() on int), producing errors instead of grids for all cases—nothing "works" in terms of runnable output.
 * Block selection assumes vertical contiguity without gaps, which may miss horizontal-only or disconnected objects, but it's a reasonable start if the puzzle focuses on single blobs.
 * Cropping and padding are applied in the right order (columns first, then rows), but untested due to the crash.
 * No extraction of multiple objects or handling of varying non-zero values beyond binary count; assumes one main block, which might overlook puzzles with noise or multiple components.
 * The main function handles empty grids minimally, but the error prevents verification.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of cropping/padding to square but zero progress on execution, as all attempts (this one) crash identically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or produce a valid grid—it indicates a runtime failure rather than an incorrect but runnable result.
 * No actual grid is generated, so it cannot match any expected cropped/padded square for the test input; the error occurs early in compute_col_bounds, preventing any output.
 * This differs from expectations (a padded square grid representing the main object) because the code crashes instead of processing the grid; likely the test input has a valid non-empty grid, but the bug blocks all progress.
 * Without seeing the test grid, the error suggests the code isn't robust to standard inputs (e.g., non-empty bounds tuples), and future fixes must ensure no type mismatches to handle the test case properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop and normalize a larger input grid (likely 20x20 with non-zero elements forming visual "objects" or patterns in the top portion) into the smallest possible square grid that tightly bounds all non-zero cells, by shifting the content to start at position (0,0) and padding the rest with zeros to make it square (using the maximum of the bounding height and width as the side length). The output preserves the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but eliminates empty space around the edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids appear to be 20x20, but non-zero content is confined to the top ~16 rows (rows 0-15), with rows 16-19 likely being empty or irrelevant (e.g., a footer or padding); however, hardcoding "i < 16" in min/max calculations risks excluding valid content if it spills over or if the rule is more flexible.
 * Compute the bounding box by finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices with any non-zero value; height = max_r - min_r + 1, width = max_c - min_c + 1; side length s = max(height, width) to ensure a square output.
 * Shift all non-zero cells by subtracting min_r from their row index and min_c from their column index, placing them in a new s x s grid starting at (0,0); any cells that would fall outside after shifting are discarded (though this hasn't occurred in examples).
 * Outputs are printed as lists of integers (one per row), with the number of lists indicating the grid height (which should equal s); all outputs must be square, but the provided generated outputs vary in size and include unnecessary empty rows/columns.
 * Subtlety: Disconnected components or scattered non-zeros (e.g., in train3, there are separate 1's, 4's, and 2's) must all be included in the single bounding box—no extraction of individual "objects"; the entire non-zero content is treated as one unit.
 * Easy to miss: Padding must be zeros only outside the shifted bounding box; do not alter values or introduce new non-zeros; if the bounding box is empty or all zeros, output a 0x0 or minimal grid, but examples have content.
 * Grids may have irregular shapes (e.g., train1 has a frame-like 3's with internal 8's, 6's; train2 has nested shapes with 5's as borders), so min/max must scan every cell accurately without assuming connectivity.
 * Outputs in examples are rectangular in print but should represent square grids (e.g., train2 expected is 10x10, but printed as 10 lists of 10 ints); ensure no trailing empty rows/columns in the final grid.
 * The program ignores rows >=16 entirely in min/max, which works if content is always top-heavy but fails if not; also, if min_r ==20 (all empty in top 16), it returns 0, which may pad incorrectly.
 * No rotation, scaling, or value changes—just translation to top-left and squaring.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions for finding min/max row/col and shifting are conceptually useful but buggy (e.g., hardcoded i<16 limits scanning; compute_size is correct but simplistic; shift_and_place discards out-of-bounds but doesn't handle empty cases well). Here's a refined version without the row limit, using full 20x20 scan:

```python
from typing import List

def find_min_r(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    min_r = len(g)  # Assume 20
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, i)
                break  # Optimize: once row has non-zero, it's min
    return min_r if min_r < len(g) else 0  # 0 if empty?

def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    max_r = -1
    for i in range(len(g) - 1, -1, -1):  # Scan from bottom for efficiency
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                max_r = i
                break
    return max_r if max_r >= 0 else 0

# Similar for find_min_c and find_max_c, scanning columns fully without i<16 limit

def compute_size(h: int, w: int) -> int:
    return max(h, w) if h > 0 and w > 0 else 0  # Handle empty case

def create_empty_grid(s: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[0] * s for _ in range(s)] if s > 0 else []

def shift_and_place(g: List[List[int]], new_grid: List[List[int]], min_r: int, min_c: int, s: int) -> None:
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                ni = i - min_r
                nj = j - min_c
                if 0 <= ni < s and 0 <= nj < s:
                    new_grid[ni][nj] = g[i][j]
```

No types like PuzzleElement are needed; simple grid ops suffice. Function to extract all non-zero positions could help verify bounding box:

```python
def get_nonzero_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    positions = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                positions.append((i, j))
    return positions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a bounding box approach but hardcoded row scans to i<16, which excluded potential content below row 15 and led to incorrect min_r/max_r in cases with bottom content (though examples seem top-confined, it still failed due to sizing/shifting bugs).
 * What worked: Shifting logic in shift_and_place correctly translates cells relative to min_r/min_c; compute_size correctly makes square by max(h,w); it identified non-zeros and avoided overwriting.
 * What didn't work: Hardcoded i<16 in all find_* functions ignored rows 16-19, but even if content is there, it caused oversized s (e.g., if min_r=0, h=16ish, s large); returned 0 for empty scans but didn't handle s=0 properly, leading to empty or mismatched grids.
 * Train1: Generated a ~13x13 grid but misplaced elements—e.g., row0 has [0,0,3,0,3,...] (two 3's too early) vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] (single 3 later); internal 8's and 6's shifted wrong, with extra 3's in row2 and missing shifts in lower rows; overall, bounding box too loose, including phantom space on left/top.
 * Train2: Generated ~15x15 with lots of empty rows/columns (e.g., many leading/trailing 0's per row, and empty rows at bottom); expected is tight 10x10—e.g., generated row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,...] has scattered 5's not shifted to tight bound, while expected starts with [5,0,5,...] packed left; 3's and 4's misaligned, with extra padding.
 * Train3: Generated ~14x14 with excessive empties (e.g., many all-zero rows at top/middle); expected 10x10 tight—e.g., generated has isolated 1's and 4's spread out (row0 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,...] vs expected starting directly with [0,4,0,4,...]); alternating 4's not packed, 2's blob shifted incorrectly, leading to loose bounds.
 * No object extraction function was used or needed; the attempt treated the whole grid as one, which is correct, but didn't verify with something like get_nonzero_positions to debug bounds.
 * Function find_min_r etc. are helpful but broken due to i<16—remove limit; shift_and_place is useful but should check for empty input (s=0) to return empty list.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The hardcoded row limit makes all scans incomplete; compute_size returns max even if h=0, potentially giving s=w but wrong if empty; no handling for non-square inputs leading to oversized outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it generates a nearly full 19x19 grid (19 rows listed, many with 19 elements) filled mostly with zeros and scattered non-zeros (e.g., 5's in columns 3-4 early on, 3's at bottom-left, 4 in row12 col12), but fails to tightly bound or shift: e.g., non-zeros span from row2 (3's) to row15 (3's), columns 2-18, but output includes huge empty top/left/right/bottom padding instead of cropping to ~14x17 then squaring to 17x17 and shifting everything to top-left.
 * It looks incorrect because the bounding box isn't computed tightly (likely due to i<16 including too much empty space above/below, or wrong min_r=0 assuming full height); shifted positions are off—e.g., the cluster of 3's/5's/4 in rows10-15 cols9-18 should pack to row0 col0 start, but remains offset; extra empty rows (e.g., rows5-6,8-9 all zeros) bloat the size unnecessarily.
 * Does not make sense: Expected should be a compact square (s~10-14 based on visible clusters: vertical 5's early, horizontal 3's/5's bottom), with all non-zeros contiguous from (0,0), no scattered empties inside bounds; this output retains input layout too closely without proper crop/shift, suggesting the i<16 bug or full-grid scan without true min/max.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels or labeled regions in a visual drawing) to isolate and output a cropped, centered, and square-padded version of the primary "object" or content, excluding backgrounds, frames, or extraneous elements. The goal appears to be tight bounding box cropping around the meaningful visual element, followed by padding to a square, but the exact definition of the "primary object" (e.g., excluding connected borders or frames) is key to matching expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids contain numbers like 0 (background), 3 (possibly a frame or border color), 4/5/6/8 (object colors), and the output must preserve these values exactly while adjusting positions via cropping/padding.
 * Connected components are 8-directional (including diagonals), which is correctly implemented, but the "largest" component may include unwanted frames (e.g., surrounding 3's in train1 and test), leading to overly broad bounding boxes that shift or include extra elements.
 * Cropping must be precise to the minimal bounding box of the intended object; padding centers the cropped content in a square of side max(height, width) of the crop, with 0's filling edges, but misalignment occurs if the bbox is wrong (e.g., generated outputs shift rows/columns relative to expected).
 * Subtle elements: Outer frames (e.g., 3's in train1/test) seem treated as background to exclude, not part of the object; multiple components exist (e.g., separate blobs of 4/6/8), so largest-by-size may grab the frame instead of the inner drawing. In train2/3, rotations or symmetries in borders (5's/4's) suggest excluding perimeter patterns. Padding must not introduce asymmetries; expected outputs often have irregular padding (e.g., more 0's on one side).
 * All non-zero cells aren't always the object—likely need to ignore border-like structures (e.g., full rows/columns of same number). Outputs are always square-padded but dimensions vary (13x13 for train1, 10x10 for train2/3, 7x7 for test).
 * Easy to miss: Component size counts cells, but frames may be larger; bbox updates must track min/max accurately during flood-fill. No rotation or flipping seems needed, but symmetries in inputs (e.g., test's H-like 3's with inner 4) imply symmetric cropping.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes largest component is the target, which fails; need to perhaps find bbox of all non-zero or subtract frame. Outputs must match expected exactly, including 0 placements—no tolerance for shifts.

```
* No unhelpful/broken functions in attempt; the provided ones are relevant but insufficient alone (e.g., find_largest_component_bbox grabs wrong region).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Single attempt shown: All three training examples failed due to incorrect bbox selection, leading to shifted or inclusive cropping that mismatches expected positions and includes/excludes wrong elements.
 * Train1: Generated crops to a 13x13 square including a full 3's frame and inner elements, but bbox starts too left/early (e.g., row1 has 3 at col3 and col5, vs expected's 3's at col4 and col11; row3 has 8's starting col3 vs expected col4; overall, generated includes extra top-left 3's and misaligns bottom rows like row10 having 8's where expected has 0's). What worked: Correctly identifies connected 3/8/6 regions and pads to square. What didn't: Largest component is the 3's frame (connected around edges), bloating bbox and shifting content right/down vs expected (which seems to crop tighter around inner 8/6 with partial 3's).
 * Train2: Generated 10x10 crops include 5's border and inner 3/4, but misaligns (e.g., row2 has 3's starting col4 vs expected row2 all 0's except col7=3; row4 has 3's at col2/3 and 4 at col5/6 vs expected row4 3's at col3 and 4's shifted right; includes extra 5's on right). What worked: Padding logic centers roughly. What didn't: Grabs 5's frame as part of largest component, causing vertical/horizontal shifts; expected excludes some 0-rows and adjusts for inner 3/4 blob, possibly treating 5's as background.
 * Train3: Generated 10x10 includes 4's border and inner 1/2, but rotates or shifts borders (e.g., row1 starts with 4,0,4,... vs expected row1 0,4,0,...; row3 has 1 at col4 vs expected row3 1's at col4/5 but different 0 placements; overall, generated seems to crop from a different origin, including extra 4's on edges). What worked: 8-connected flood-fill correctly groups 1/2/4. What didn't: Largest component includes perimeter 4's (alternating pattern), leading to bbox that flips or misaligns symmetries; expected tightens to inner 1/2 with minimal border, suggesting frame exclusion.
 * General: Attempt understands connected components and bbox/padding, but misses that frames (3/5/4 borders) are not the "object"—need to detect/exclude them (e.g., via perimeter check or non-largest component). No extraction of "objects" beyond largest; could add frame detection. Unknown why shifts occur exactly (possibly bbox min_r/min_c off by 1-2 due to frame inclusion).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (7x7) does not look correct: It crops to include the full 3's frame (forming an H or window shape) with inner 4, but bbox seems too broad/left-aligned (e.g., row1 [0,0,3,3,0,0,0] includes left 3's cluster; row7 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0] has bottom-right 3 isolated). Expected likely tighter around the central 4 and symmetric 3's arms, excluding outer 0's or frame edges—e.g., should center the 4 at ~row4/col4 with balanced 3's padding, matching train patterns where frames are partially omitted/shifted (e.g., more 0's on sides, no full border inclusion). This fails similarly to trainings by treating the 3's frame as the primary component; to fix, exclude perimeter-connected 3's or use overall non-zero bbox for tighter fit.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract the primary cluster or "object" of non-zero values from a sparse grid, crop to its tight bounding box (excluding distant outliers), translate the content to the top-left corner, and pad with zeros to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and shapes of the non-zero elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The primary task is outlier removal by selecting the densest contiguous block of rows with the most non-zeros, then cropping columns to the minimal bounding box that covers non-zeros only within that row block—this excludes scattered or distant elements (e.g., isolated 8's at the bottom in train1 or isolated 3's/4's in train2).
 * After cropping, translate the content to top-left (no leading zero rows or columns before the first non-zero), then pad to the smallest square size using zeros, but padding appears to be added only as needed on the right and bottom (not centered), maintaining the top-left alignment of the main cluster.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have multiple disconnected components (e.g., borders, stray pixels like the top-left 8's in train1 or bottom 5's in train2); only the main dense cluster should be kept, ignoring low-density or isolated parts. Padding must not introduce artificial centering that shifts the content away from top-left. Row/column counts must handle empty rows/columns correctly without including them in the bounding box. The output square size is determined by the max of cropped height and width, with uneven padding (e.g., more on one side if odd difference).
 * Considerations across attempts: Prefix sums for efficient max subarray sum on row densities work well for finding dense blocks but fail if the "best" block includes empty internal rows incorrectly or if column cropping leaks outliers from outside the row block. Centered padding breaks top-left alignment, leading to extra zeros on left/top. No handling for cases with no non-zeros (should return minimal [[0]]). Grids can be rectangular input but output must be square. Values like 3,5,8,4,6,1,2 are treated as non-zero "filled" pixels without regard to their specific numbers—only presence matters for density/cropping.
 * Easy-to-miss: The expected outputs preserve exact relative positions within the crop (no rotation/scaling), and the square padding is minimal (e.g., train1 expected is 13x13, not larger). Isolated single rows/columns of non-zeros (e.g., bottom 5's in train3) are outliers to ignore. If multiple dense blocks exist, pick the one with max total non-zeros, allowing internal empties but not extending to sparse ends.

    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is helpful for density calculations and works correctly.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Compute non-zero counts for each row in the grid."""
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preparing data for block selection.)

```python
def get_prefix_sums(counts: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Compute prefix sums of row counts for efficient range sum queries."""
    prefix = [0]
    for c in counts:
        prefix.append(prefix[-1] + c)
    return prefix
```
(Very helpful for O(n^2) max subarray sum to find densest row block efficiently; core to outlier removal.)

```python
def find_max_sum_row_block(prefix: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the contiguous row block with the maximum total non-zeros (allows internal empty rows)."""
    n = len(prefix) - 1
    max_sum = 0
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 2):
            current_sum = prefix[j - 1] - prefix[i]
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_start = i
                best_end = j - 2  # Adjust for prefix indexing
    return best_start, best_end
```
(Helpful for selecting the main row block but buggy in indexing—best_end = j-2 can cause off-by-one errors leading to included/excluded rows; still useful as a base for density-based selection.)

```python
def find_col_bounds(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:

                has_nonzero = True
    if not has_nonzero:
        return 0, 0
    return min_c, max_c
```
(Helpful for column cropping within the selected rows; correctly ignores zeros but assumes uniform column length—works well if no outliers outside row block.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Crop the grid to the specified row and column range (preserves relative positions)."""
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row_slice = g[i][min_c:max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row_slice)
    return cropped
```
(Helpful and correct for extracting the subgrid; preserves exact values and positions.)

The following function is broken/not helpful:
```python
def pad_to_square_size(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Pad the cropped grid to a square by adding zero rows and columns centered (global translation and padding rule)."""
    # ... (centered padding logic)
```
(This is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle: it centers padding, shifting content away from top-left, which mismatches all expectations; replace with top-left padding to right/bottom.)

```python
def remove_outliers_by_block(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Select the densest row block to exclude distant outliers (outlier removal rule)."""
    # Composes the above but inherits bugs from find_max_sum_row_block and lacks top-left translation.
```
(Partially helpful as a composer but overall broken due to no translation step after crop and buggy block selection.)

No types like classes are used; simple List[List[int]] for grids is sufficient. No extraction of "objects" beyond density-based cropping is needed—treating the grid as a binary image (non-zero vs zero) for bounding box is key.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the need for density-based row block selection (using max subarray sum on row non-zero counts) to remove outliers, which works conceptually for excluding sparse rows (e.g., empty rows in train1).
 * What worked: Prefix sum approach efficiently finds contiguous dense rows; column bounding correctly tightens width to non-zeros in the block; cropping preserves relative positions and values.
 * What didn't work: All three training examples failed completely—generated outputs include extra padding, outliers, and wrong sizes/shifts. For train1, generated a oversized ~19x19 grid with centered padding, including bottom 8's as outliers and extra left/top zeros, vs expected 13x13 top-left cropped main 3/8 figure (missing bottom padding row and left zeros in some places). For train2, generated ~17x17 with stray 3's/4's/5's not cropped out, centered, and wrong row order/alignment vs expected 10x10 tight crop of central 5/3/4 cluster. For train3, generated mostly zeros with scattered remnants (e.g., isolated 1's and bottom 4's not excluded), oversized, vs expected 10x10 tight alternating 4/1/2 pattern cropped from middle.
 * Missed top-left translation after cropping (generated has centered zeros on left/top); buggy best_end indexing in find_max_sum_row_block likely includes/excludes wrong rows (e.g., train1 includes too many empty rows). Centered padding is a core mismatch—always shifts content incorrectly. No handling for multiple candidate blocks (always picks max but may pick wrong if ties). Function pad_to_square_size is incorrect/not relevant (causes all alignment failures; avoid in future). Overall, partial understanding of cropping but fails on alignment/padding, leading to no training passes. extract_objects-like logic isn't present but density cropping approximates it helpfully.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to be an uncropped or partially processed ~19x19 grid including multiple disconnected clusters (e.g., top scattered 3/5/4's, middle 3/4/5's, bottom 5's) without tight bounding, top-left alignment, or square padding; it has irregular leading zeros per row and preserves full input width/sparsity, suggesting the program applied loose row block selection but failed column crop or padding entirely (e.g., includes empty columns and distant 5's at bottom-right). This mismatches the pattern from trainings, where outputs should be small tight squares (~10-13 size) with only the densest central cluster (likely the middle 3/4/5 block here, cropped to ~8x10 then padded to 10x10 top-left). It looks like a near-input copy with some row selection but no real processing, so incorrect—likely due to indexing bugs including extra rows/columns and no translation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract and normalize the core "image" or content from sparse 2D grids filled with numbers representing pixels or symbols, likely by cropping out surrounding empty (zero) space and centering/padding the result into a square format while preserving the relative positions and asymmetries of the non-zero elements. The goal is to produce a tight, centered bounding box of the active content without distorting shapes, but the current program over-crops or misaligns columns/rows, leading to shifted or incomplete representations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids represent visual patterns (e.g., shapes or symbols made of numbers like 3,8,6,5,4,1), and the output must preserve exact relative positions of non-zeros, including asymmetries (e.g., in training example 1, the top row's 3s are not symmetrically placed, and internal "gaps" like zero rows or columns within the content must not be cropped out if they are structural).
 * Cropping should use the global min/max row and column indices of all non-zero cells across the entire grid, not just the longest contiguous block of non-empty rows—this misses disconnected or gapped components (e.g., borders or separate objects).
 * Padding must be centered (equal or near-equal on both sides) to make a square of side max(height, width) of the cropped grid, but only after accurate cropping; over-padding or incorrect min/max leads to shifted content.
 * Empty rows/columns on the borders should be fully removed, but internal empties (e.g., in training example 2's row 1 or 8) are part of the design and must stay.
 * Subtle asymmetries in expected outputs (e.g., training example 1's bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] vs. generated [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]; training example 3's row orders are swapped in places) suggest the puzzle may involve orientation or specific "framing" rules, but cropping must not reorder or flip.
 * All non-zero values (regardless of their number, e.g., 3 as border, 8/6 as fills) define the bounds; zeros inside are intentional spaces, not to be filled.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 13x13 for train1, 10x10 for others), and output should match input dimensions if square, but centered padding ensures squareness.
 * Potential multiple "objects" (e.g., borders around inner shapes in train3), so bounding box must encompass all, not just the densest area.
 * Edge cases: Fully empty grids return [[0]]; uneven padding (e.g., (s - dim) // 2 for one side) to handle odd differences.

from typing import List

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)

    for j in range(len(row)):
        if row[j] != 0:

```
(Helpful for left-edge detection per row; extend to global min_col by taking min over all rows' first_nonzero.)

    return -1
```
(Helpful for right-edge detection per row; extend to global max_col by taking max over all rows' last_nonzero.)
```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is good: compute global min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c from all non-zeros
    # Then crop: [row[min_c:max_c+1] for row in g[start:end+1]]
    # Then pad to s = max(h, w) centered, as done (pad_left = (s - w)//2, etc.)
    # But replace contiguous block logic with full scan:
    n, m = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    min_r, max_r = n, -1
    min_c, max_c = m, -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, i)
                max_r = max(max_r, i)
                min_c = min(min_c, j)
                max_c = max(max_c, j)
    if max_r < 0:
        return [[0]]
    cropped = [row[min_c:max_c+1] for row in g[min_r:max_r+1]]
    # Rest of padding logic as-is
```
(This improved version uses full bounding box; original's contiguous rows fail on gapped content.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies non-empty rows and pads to a square centered, which works for basic symmetry and size normalization (e.g., outputs are square-ish and zero-padded).
 * However, it fails to compute accurate column bounds (min_c/max_c) by only scanning a contiguous row block, leading to left-shifted content (e.g., in train1, generated starts 3s at column 2 instead of 3, and includes extra left zeros while missing right placements like the final 3 in row 0).
 * Longest contiguous non-empty rows logic ignores global content, cropping out top/bottom elements (e.g., train1 generated omits or shifts the asymmetric 3s in expected row 0 and 12; train2 generated places 3s wrong in row 1 and shifts inner 4s/3s).
 * In train3, row order and positions are mangled (e.g., generated keeps border-like 4s but misaligns inner 1/2 shapes, swapping some row patterns entirely compared to expected, possibly due to incorrect row start/end).
 * Function `count_nonzeros` is helpful for row density but not used effectively for global bounds.
 * Functions `first_nonzero` and `last_nonzero` are useful per-row tools but underutilized—program takes min/max over a subset of rows only, causing incomplete column spans (e.g., misses rightmost 3s in train1 row 11).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., separate shapes like borders vs. fills) attempted, but may not be needed; simple bounding box suffices if global.
 * Padding works partially (centered zeros added correctly), but since crop is wrong, final output has artifacts like extra internal zeros or shifts (e.g., train2 generated has 3s in row1 where expected has zeros, and misplaces 4s).
 * Train1 mismatches include: row0 generated [0,0,3,0,3,...] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,...3,...] (shifted left, wrong positions); row2 generated has 8s starting too left; row10 generated [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,3,0] (missing right 8, extra left alignment).
 * Train2 mismatches: row1 generated [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0] (3 too left); row3 generated [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5] (extra left 3s, missing right 3s); inner 4s shifted.
 * Train3 mismatches: Entire structure wrong—generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips row patterns (e.g., expected row0 [0,4,0,...] vs generated row1; inner 1/2 blobs misaligned, e.g., row4 generated [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4] with different zero placements).
 * No reordering or flipping attempted, which might be needed for train3's apparent rotation, but likely not—mismatches are from bad cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it excessively pads with zero rows (e.g., rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zero, but content starts at row3 with partial 3s, suggesting over-removal of top rows or wrong row bounds; expected likely crops tighter to rows with 5/3/4 content).
 * Content is somewhat preserved (e.g., central 3s and 4 in rows 4-8 match patterns like train1/2), but columns are shifted left (e.g., row4 [5,5,0,3,3,...] starts 5s too early vs. likely expected border-like spacing), and right side has uneven 5s, missing potential asymmetry.
 * Too many full-zero rows indicate the contiguous block logic failed again (test input has zero rows at top/bottom, but program may have cropped to inner block, excluding framing 5s properly).
 * Inner structure (e.g., 3s forming a shape with 4 inside, 5s as border) is visible but misaligned, e.g., row5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] has 3s not centered; does not match a clean, tight crop—likely needs global min/max to include all 5/3/4 without extra left/right zeros.
 * Overall, it partially captures the "object" but distorts positions, similar to training failures; correct output should be a centered square with exact non-zero placements, no excessive zero borders beyond minimal padding.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to extract the "main content" of a sparse grid (likely an image or diagram represented as numbers) by cropping to a tight bounding box around all non-zero elements and then padding the result to a centered square of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, using zero-padding. The output must exactly match the expected grid structure, including precise positioning of non-zeros after padding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping must capture *all* non-zero elements in the grid without excluding any, even if they are separated by empty (all-zero) rows or columns within the content area—do not assume content is in a single consecutive block.
 * Padding must be centered: for a subgrid of height h and width w, pad to size s = max(h, w), with vertical padding split as evenly as possible (top_pad = (s - h) // 2, bottom_pad = s - h - top_pad) and similarly for horizontal (left/right), ensuring zeros are added symmetrically around the content.
 * The bounding box for rows should be the minimal and maximal row indices containing *any* non-zero (i.e., overall min_r and max_r across the entire grid where sum(row) > 0), not the longest consecutive sequence of non-empty rows, as empty rows inside the content must still be included if they are between min_r and max_r.
 * For columns, the bounding box should similarly be the minimal and maximal column indices with *any* non-zero in the entire grid (or equivalently in the row-bounded subgrid), to avoid shifting or excluding edge content.
 * Grids may have outer empty rows/columns that should be cropped out, but inner empty rows/columns within the bounding box must be preserved as part of the content.
 * Output must be a list of lists (exact 2D structure), with each inner list being a flat row of integers—no formatting errors like mixing list-of-lists with separate lists.
 * Subtleties include handling cases where h != w (asymmetric padding), grids with isolated non-zeros (e.g., borders or sparse elements), and ensuring no artificial shifting occurs during extraction (e.g., due to incorrect min_c/max_c calculation).
 * All training examples failed, suggesting the consecutive-rows approach fragments content; the test output's weird formatting (mixing [] and [[ ]]) indicates a printing or return issue in the program.
 * No evidence of needing to "extract objects" like blobs or connected components—it's purely bounding box + padding, not semantic analysis.
 * Consider overall sparsity: grids have lots of zeros, so sum(row) > 0 is a reliable non-empty check, but verify with any(g[i][j] != 0 for j in row).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current attempt's functions are mostly on the right track for extraction and padding but broken in row selection; here's a refined version of key helpers (unhelpful ones like find_longest_consecutive_nonempty_rows should be discarded):

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_overall_bounding_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the minimal and maximal row indices containing at least one non-zero element (overall bounding, includes inner empties)."""
    n = len(g)
    nonempty_rows = [i for i in range(n) if any(cell != 0 for cell in g[i])]
    if not nonempty_rows:
        return 0, n - 1  # Edge case: all empty, return full grid
    return min(nonempty_rows), max(nonempty_rows)

def find_overall_bounding_columns(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the minimal and maximal column indices containing at least one non-zero in the entire grid."""
    n_rows = len(g)
    if n_rows == 0:
        return 0, 0
    n_cols = len(g[0])
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(n_rows):
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_c = min(min_c, j)
                max_c = max(max_c, j)
    if max_c == -1:
        return 0, n_cols - 1  # All empty
    return min_c, max_c
```

```python
def create_padded_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Extract the subgrid from the given bounds and pad to a square of side max(h, w), centered with zeros."""
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    size = max(h, w)
    top_pad = (size - h) // 2
    bottom_pad = size - h - top_pad
    left_pad = (size - w) // 2
    right_pad = size - w - left_pad
    # Extract subgrid rows
    subgrid = [[g[min_r + i][min_c + j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    # Horizontally pad each row
    padded_rows = [[ [0] * left_pad + subgrid[i] + [0] * right_pad for i in range(h) ]]
    # Vertically pad with zero rows
    output = [[0] * size for _ in range(top_pad)] + padded_rows[0] + [[0] * size for _ in range(bottom_pad)]
    return output
```

The function find_longest_consecutive_nonempty_rows from the attempt is broken/not helpful (it ignores inner empty rows and picks only the longest block, leading to incomplete content; discard it). find_bounding_columns is mostly helpful but should use overall grid, not row-limited. create_padded_subgrid is helpful but has a minor bug in the attempt's version (padded_sub uses list comprehension incorrectly, leading to nested lists; fixed above). No need for object extraction functions, as the puzzle is geometric cropping, not component analysis.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on cropping to the longest consecutive non-empty rows, which worked for identifying a dense block but failed by excluding potential inner empty rows or outer content, resulting in shifted or incomplete grids in all training examples.
 * Padding logic was mostly correct (centered zeros to square), but extraction errors propagated, causing mismatches like extra/missing non-zeros or wrong positions (e.g., in Train 1, generated row 0 has 3's at positions 2 and 4, but expected has them at 3 and 11; unknown why exactly, but likely due to wrong min_c shifting the subgrid left).
 * In Train 1, the generated grid mismatched expected in multiple rows: e.g., row 2 generated [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3] (leading 3's missing, trailing 3 added; row 5 generated [0,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,0,8,8,3,3] vs expected [3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,0,8,8,3,0] (leading zeros instead of 3's); row 9 generated [3,3,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,3,0] vs expected [0,3,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,3,0] (extra 8's and wrong positions).
 * In Train 2, generated mismatched in row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5] (extra 3's, missing trailing 3 and 5 shift); row 4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs expected [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0] (missing 4's, wrong positions for 3's); the generated seems to have cropped too narrowly on columns, excluding right-edge content.
 * In Train 3, generated row 2 [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] (leading 4 misplaced, missing inner 1's); row 5 [0,4,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,4] vs expected [4,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,4,0] (wrong starting elements, shifted 1's and 4's); suggests incorrect row/column bounds, possibly treating border patterns as separate blocks.
 * All attempts (just this one) produced 2D lists correctly sized to square but with content errors; no successful training passes, indicating core row selection flaw.
 * Function find_longest_consecutive_nonempty_rows is incorrect and not relevant (it splits on inner empties, don't use it); find_bounding_columns is partially helpful but row-limited; create_padded_subgrid has nesting bug in horizontal padding.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it has inconsistent formatting (some rows as flat [0,0,...] lists, others as [[0,0,...]] sublists, and stray empty rows like [0,0,...] repeated), suggesting a return or printing bug in the program rather than a clean 2D list.
 * Content appears partially cropped (e.g., middle rows show 3's, 4's, 5's in a pattern, with empty top/bottom), but it's not centered-padded to a proper square—e.g., row with [[5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5]] has 13 elements, but surrounding empties are not symmetrically padded, and the overall structure mixes 1D/2D, making it invalid.
 * It seems to have applied the consecutive-rows logic, capturing a central block but missing precise bounds (e.g., the 3's and 5's look like borders, but positions don't align symmetrically); without expected test output, it's unclear if content matches, but the messiness indicates it won't pass any validation.
 * To handle test case, ensure overall bounding (not consecutive) to capture full border-like patterns, and fix output to always return List[List[int]] without nesting errors.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation, where the goal is to identify the core non-zero content (likely an "image" or object formed by numbers representing colors/shapes) within a larger grid that may include borders, frames, or extraneous zeros, then crop, pad, and center it into a square format while preserving the relative positions and values of the inner elements. The outputs suggest a need to tightly bound the main block, handle irregular shapes without distortion, and ensure precise alignment/padding to match expected layouts, possibly accounting for symmetric frames or multiple components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids contain numbers (e.g., 3 for borders/frames, 6/8/4/5 for inner shapes/objects) separated by zeros; the "main block" is the contiguous or visually central non-zero region, but not necessarily the absolute minimal bounding box if it includes frame elements that should be partially retained or adjusted.
 * Padding must create a square (side length based on max of height/width of the block), with even distribution on all sides, but the current approach over-pads or misaligns, leading to shifted elements (e.g., borders not symmetric).
 * Subtle asymmetries in inner shapes (e.g., 8's and 6's in train 1 forming irregular blobs) must be preserved exactly; the program distorts by slicing incorrectly or assuming uniform rows.
 * Frames (e.g., 3's in train 1/2, 4's/5's in train 2/3) seem integral but need selective inclusion/exclusion—generated outputs include full frames but misplace inner details, suggesting the block should encompass frame + content but center precisely.
 * Handle multiple disconnected components (e.g., train 1 has 6's and 8's not fully contiguous); the longest consecutive row span works partially but fails on column bounding if rows have varying non-zero extents.
 * Zeros inside the block (holes in shapes) must remain; padding adds outer zeros only, but current code adds uneven pads, causing shifts (e.g., train 1 generated top row has 3's too leftward vs. expected).
 * Grid size varies (13x13 in train 1, 10x10 in others); output must match input dimensions or expand to square, but examples show same size with internal rearrangement/padding.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs sometimes swap or reorder rows/columns slightly (e.g., train 1 row 2 expected matches generated row 2, but row 3 has 8's shifted right; train 3 borders are inverted in positions), hinting at possible rotation, mirroring, or canonical orientation.
 * For test input: Central cross-like shape with 3's (horizontal/vertical bars), framed by 5's on sides and bottom; main block spans rows 3-9, columns 0-12, but with sparse 4's—output should center this into square, preserving the 3-bar structure without over-padding edges.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies a vertical span of non-empty rows (e.g., train 1 uses rows 2-11, close to expected) and computes a square side s = max(h, w), which works for sizing.
 * What worked: Padding adds zeros correctly in concept, and output remains same dimensions; handles empty grids edge case.
 * What didn't: Bounding box is too loose on columns (uses global min/max_cs across rows, but rows have varying extents, leading to extra zeros sliced in, e.g., train 1 generated row 3 has 8's starting too early vs. expected shifted right).
 * Train 1: Generated includes full 3-frame but shifts inner 8/6 shapes left/up (e.g., row 3 generated [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs. expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...]—3's protrude incorrectly, and bottom rows mismatch in 8 placements, possibly due to uneven pad_w=1 or wrong min_c=1).
 * Train 2: Generated border 5's/3's misaligned (e.g., row 4 generated [5,0,3,0,4,...] vs. expected [5,3,3,0,4,...]—inner 3's and 4's shifted, missing right-side 3's; seems to crop too narrowly on columns).
 * Train 3: Generated inverts border pattern (starts with [4,0,4,...] on row 0 vs. expected [0,4,0,...]), and inner 1/2 shapes are distorted (e.g., row 5 generated [0,4,1,0,2,...] vs. expected [4,0,0,0,2,...]—rows appear swapped or columns offset by 1).
 * Overall: Program assumes rectangular uniform slice, but shapes are irregular; no handling for frame detection or orientation—leads to all INCORRECT.
 * find_main_block is partially helpful for row spans but broken for columns (min/max_cs aggregates wrongly, inflating w); use but refine with per-row trimming.
 * No other functions tried; this attempt shows basic understanding of cropping/padding but misses shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output pads the entire grid to 13x13 (all zeros except inner), centering a block around rows 4-8 with 3's and 5's/4's, but it looks incorrect: it retains full-width 5's on sides but squishes the central 3-bar structure (e.g., row 5 generated [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] vs. what should be a tighter centered cross preserving sparse 4's and gaps—expected likely has more even padding, no side 5's bleeding into center, and 4's unshifted).
 * Differences: Over-pads top/bottom with 3 empty rows each (reasonable for square but misaligns if s computed wrong); inner 3's form a plus-sign but generated row 6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] keeps side 5's too wide, distorting the frame—expected should crop 5's as borders and center only the 3/4 core, possibly rotating to match train patterns.
 * Does not make sense: The output treats 5's as part of main block (w too wide), leading to asymmetric padding; subtle 4's (single cell?) are preserved but offset, hinting program misses isolated elements—likely needs component detection, not just bounding box.
 * To handle test: Refine column bounds to tightest per row, exclude outer frames if they are uniform (e.g., detect 5's as border), and ensure s pads minimally while keeping shape intact.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

```
The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with different "colors" or values like 3,6,8) to extract the central or main non-zero content, crop it to a tight bounding box, and pad it symmetrically to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main block" should be identified as the longest consecutive sequence of rows with any non-zero elements, but care must be taken to exclude leading/trailing fully zero rows without including isolated zero rows within the block if they are structurally important (e.g., in example 1, internal zero positions are preserved but the block start/end must align precisely with the expected cropped area).
 * Column bounds must be computed only over the main row block, finding the minimal and maximal non-zero columns across those rows, but without expanding beyond the actual content—subtly, if a row in the block has no non-zeros (but is included in the block due to adjacency), its bounds should not affect min/max (current compute_col_bounds skips if l==-1, which is good, but may still misalign if block includes empty rows incorrectly).
 * Padding to square must be symmetric (centering the content) using zeros, first padding columns to match height, then rows to match the new width, but the target size is max(h,w) after cropping—issue is that if cropping misses parts, padding adds extra zeros in wrong places (e.g., in example 1, generated adds unintended non-zeros or shifts content left/right).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes with borders of zeros; the output should be square but retain the exact relative positions of non-zeros from the cropped area (e.g., example 2 shows misalignment in rows 3-4 where generated has [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] but expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], indicating column crop is too narrow or shifted).
 * Subtle element: Non-zeros represent "pixels" of different types (e.g., 3 might be borders, 6/8 fills), and the puzzle likely requires exact reproduction without altering values or introducing new ones—easy to miss that bounding box must be inclusive of all edge non-zeros but exclusive of outer empty space.
 * In example 3, the pattern alternates rows/columns, and generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips the starting row order, suggesting possible row reversal or reordering not handled (or wrong block detection includes extra).
 * General: Handle empty or all-zero grids by returning [[0]]; assume rectangular input; outputs are lists of lists, printed as rows.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), consider that main block detection uses row non-zero counts correctly but may over-include if zero rows are adjacent (e.g., example 1 generated includes row 0 with partial non-zeros? Wait, generated row 0 [0,0,3,0,3,...] suggests crop started too early or wrong min_c).

        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row min/max non-zero columns; essential for tight cropping, but only applied to main block rows.)

            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c

(Combines row bounds for overall column crop; helpful but may yield empty if all rows in block are zero, leading to [[0]] fallback.)

            lst[r] = [0] * left_or_top + lst[r] + [0] * right_or_bottom
    return lst
```
(Handles symmetric zero-padding for dimensions; useful and correct in isolation, but applied after faulty crop leads to misaligned content.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    size = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, False)  # pad columns
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, True)   # pad rows
    return cropped
```
(Overall squaring logic; helpful but order matters—padding columns first then rows ensures square, but if w > h initially, row padding adds to height correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the concept of finding a main non-zero block via row counts and cropping to bounding box, which works for isolating content in dense grids but fails on precise start/end (e.g., Train 1 generated starts crop too early, including extraneous left-shifted 3's in row 0 and mismatches like row 2 [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—shifted right by 1 and wrong values at ends; unknown why exact mismatch but likely min_c off by 1).
 * Train 2: Cropping works for row block but column bounds too narrow, omitting right-side elements (generated row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—missing two 3's on right, extra 3 on left); padding adds zeros incorrectly around incomplete crop.
 * Train 3: Block detection includes wrong rows, leading to row order flip or extra borders (generated row 0 [4,0,4,...] vs expected row 0 [0,4,0,...]—seems like it cropped starting from an offset row and didn't reverse or adjust for alternating pattern).
 * find_main_block is helpful but broken for cases with internal zero rows that should be included (it skips on any zero count row, potentially splitting blocks—e.g., if a structural zero row has count=0 but is part of the object, it's excluded).
 * get_row_bounds and compute_col_bounds are essential and mostly correct but fail when block has varying widths, leading to over-tight crops.
 * pad_dimension and pad_to_square are not broken and helpful for final output, but unhelpful if upstream crop is wrong (don't modify, but ensure crop inputs are accurate).
 * Overall, no extraction of "objects" like connected components was attempted, which might be needed if multiple disjoint parts exist (not in this code, but could be relevant for subtleties like ignoring outliers); current approach assumes single main block.
 * Train 1 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., generated row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—extra 3 and wrong positions, likely from faulty end_r or max_c).
 * No function for connected component analysis or object extraction, which might be unhelpful here since the puzzle seems bounding-box based, not segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped a central 5x13-ish pattern (rows ~3-9 with 3's,5's,4's) but padded excessively to 13x13 with large zero borders, shifting the content downward and not centering it properly (e.g., non-zeros start at row 3, but expected likely tighter crop to rows 4-8, columns ~3-10, padded to ~7x7 square embedded in zeros without the wide empty top/bottom). 
 * It includes symmetric 5's on left/right but mismatches internal structure (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] suggests incomplete column crop, missing connections like the 4 in row 6); this doesn't make sense as a clean extraction—likely wrong min_c/max_c (too wide on sides, too narrow vertically) and over-pads without preserving the "object" shape (e.g., the cross-like 3's and inner 4 seem distorted). 
 * To handle test case, account for multiple horizontal bars (top/bottom 5's, middle 3's) by ensuring block includes all connected non-zeros vertically, even if sparse; current code probably picks a partial block, leading to missing top/bottom elements.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid processing, where the goal is to identify the primary "object" or contiguous region of non-zero values in a 2D grid (likely representing an image or shape), crop it to its tight bounding box, and then pad the result to form a square grid while preserving the content. The output should be a transformed grid that isolates and normalizes the main feature for comparison or rendering.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of rows of integers (0 for empty/background, non-zero for filled/object pixels), and the "object" is defined by contiguous sequences of rows with non-zero counts, ignoring isolated or sparse rows.
 * Focus on the largest contiguous block of rows with any non-zeros to avoid including noise or separate components; subtle elements include handling rows with varying non-zero positions (e.g., irregular shapes) and ensuring column bounds are computed only over the selected rows.
 * Cropping must create a tight bounding box: min/max columns based on the first/last non-zero in each relevant row, but aggregated globally to avoid over-cropping jagged edges.
 * Padding to square should center the content (symmetric or near-symmetric padding with zeros) and handle cases where height and width differ, potentially starting from a 1x1 zero grid if empty.
 * Edge cases: empty grids, all-zero rows/columns, single-row/column objects, or grids where non-zeros don't align perfectly; avoid assuming uniform row lengths or non-negative values.
 * Non-zero values might represent different "colors" or intensities, but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding/cropping; preserve original values in the output.
 * Subtlety: Contiguous blocks reset on zero-count rows, so multiple objects might exist, but only the largest is selected—easy to miss if code doesn't properly scan for max length.
 * Global bounds must initialize correctly (e.g., min_col to infinity or grid width, max_col to -1) to handle rows with no non-zeros within the block.

                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row horizontal bounds; note initialization of first to n and last to -1 to handle all-zero rows gracefully, where (n, -1) indicates empty.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
(Reliable for extracting subgrid; assumes valid indices and handles empty slices.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    size = max(h, w)
    # Pad columns first if needed
    if w < size:
        pad_left = (size - w) // 2
        pad_right = size - w - pad_left
        for i in range(h):
            grid[i] = [0] * pad_left + grid[i] + [0] * pad_right
        w = size
    # Pad rows if needed
    if h < size:
        pad_top = (size - h) // 2
        pad_bottom = size - h - pad_top
        empty = [0] * size
        for _ in range(pad_top):
            grid.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(pad_bottom):
            grid.append(empty[:])
    return grid
```
(Effective for centering and squaring; handles empty grids and asymmetric padding well, preserving original values.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt demonstrates partial understanding of the puzzle by correctly identifying the need for contiguous row selection, per-row bounds, tight cropping, and square padding, but fails entirely due to a runtime error in all cases.
 * What worked: The vertical block detection (find_largest_contiguous_block) and per-row bounds (get_row_first_last) are logically sound and would isolate the main object if integrated properly; cropping and padding functions execute without issues in isolation.
 * What didn't work: The compute_global_bounds function is broken—it incorrectly initializes min_c as len(bounds[0][0]), where bounds[0][0] is an int (column index), causing "object of type 'int' has no len()" error on all inputs; this prevents any successful execution, so no outputs are generated for analysis.
 * No training examples or test passed; all resulted in the same execution error, indicating the bug blocks the entire pipeline.
 * The approach assumes the largest contiguous non-zero row block is the "object," which aligns with puzzle subtleties (e.g., ignoring noise), but untested due to crash.
 * Function compute_global_bounds is broken and unhelpful in its current form (causes crash; don't use without fixing initialization to something like min_c = float('inf') or grid width, and max_c = -1, then update only if l != -1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to the len() on int bug, so no actual grid is generated—completely incorrect and unusable for verification.
 * Expected test output should be a square-padded bounding box of the main contiguous object (e.g., if test input has a central shape spanning rows 2-5 and columns 3-7, output would crop to that 4x5 region, pad to 5x5 with zeros around, preserving non-zeros); the error prevents any match, and without seeing the input grid, it's unclear if the approach would otherwise align, but the crash confirms it does not produce a valid result.
 * This highlights the need to handle empty or edge rows in bounds aggregation without assuming non-empty tuples.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns (likely representing shapes, figures, or "objects" with pixel values like 3,5,6,8,4 indicating colors or types), where the goal is to extract the "main" or primary figure/object from the input grid, normalize its position (e.g., translate to top-left), compute a bounding box, and output a square grid representation padded with zeros, while ignoring or excluding noise, frames, or secondary elements. The output size is based on the max dimension of the extracted region, but the results suggest the extraction criteria (e.g., row selection, bounding box) are imprecise, leading to inclusions/exclusions of pixels that don't match expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain a "main" figure (dense cluster of non-zero pixels) surrounded by potential noise, frames, or disconnected elements (e.g., sparse lines or dots outside the core shape); the program must identify and isolate only the primary connected or consecutive component, excluding outer frames or isolated pixels.
 * Y-range selection is critical: use consecutive rows with non-zero sums, but prioritize the block with maximum total non-zero pixels to avoid noise; however, subtle disconnected parts (e.g., small protrusions or separate blobs) may need inclusion if part of the main structure, or exclusion if they are artifacts.
 * Bounding box computation must tightly fit the main figure's extent (min/max x/y of non-zeros in selected rows), but avoid expanding to include frame-like borders; translation shifts to (0,0) origin, and output is a square of side max(width, height) of the bbox, padded with zeros—do not return the original n x n size unless s == n.
 * Subtleties include handling asymmetric shapes (e.g., figures not centered), multiple potential "main" blocks (select largest by sum or area), and ensuring no pixel values are altered during extraction/translation—only positions change.
 * Noise handling: Grids may have zero-rows or sparse rows above/below/around the main figure; do not include them in the y-range or bbox unless they connect to the main structure.
 * Output must preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within the extracted region; mismatches often occur in top/bottom rows (e.g., extra 3s included as noise) or side alignments (e.g., shifted 8s or 6s).
 * Consider connected components: The main figure may not be fully rectangular; use row_bounds to find per-row min/max x, but aggregate carefully to avoid over-expansion.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return zero-filled n x n; if no main block, output zeros; varying grid sizes (10x10 or 13x13) mean s can be < n, leading to smaller outputs implicitly padded in display.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect y-range (including noise rows) or bbox (missing/extruding parts), resulting in shifted or incomplete figures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several modular functions for row analysis and extraction, which are partially useful for identifying and isolating regions but need refinement for accurate main figure selection (e.g., better y-range logic or component detection). No new types are defined, but Tuple[int, int] for bounds and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for pixels (y,x,value) are effective for handling positions and values.

The main `program` function composes these but is flawed in y-range/bbox selection; no explicit object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) is present, which might be needed for complex shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (all training examples failed); it correctly implements modular extraction/translation/padding but fails on core selection logic.
 * What worked: Pixel extraction preserves values; translation to (0,0) normalizes position; square padding handles varying bbox sizes; row_sums and row_bounds efficiently identify dense regions without full scans.
 * What didn't work: Y-range selection via max-sum consecutive rows includes noise (e.g., top/bottom sparse rows with 3s in train1), leading to bbox that captures extras; no handling for disconnected components or frames, causing over-inclusion; output size s often matches n but with misplaced pixels due to wrong min_y/max_y.
 * Train1: Generated includes extra 3s in row0 (positions 2,4) and row12 (3s at 3,4), but expected has 3s at 3 and 10 in row0, and 3s at 5 and 7 in row12; inner figure (8s,6s) is shifted/missing parts (e.g., generated row2 has 8s at 2-3 but expected at 3; row10 has 8s at 8-9 but expected at 9 missing); overall, figure is vertically expanded with noise, horizontally misaligned (unknown reason, possibly bbox min_x too low).
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 at 3 but expected all 0s except row1 3 at 6; row3 has 3s at 1-2 but expected 3 at 2; row4 has 5 at 0,3 at 2 but expected 5 at 0,3s at 1-2; row5 matches somewhat but row6 has 4s missing in expected positions; figure is incomplete/shifted rightward, with extra 3s in noise rows (e.g., row1), suggesting wrong y-range including top noise.
 * Train3: Generated row0/1 are [4,0,4,...]/[0,4,0,...] but expected swapped to [0,4,0,...]/[4,0,4,...], indicating possible rotation or frame misextraction; inner 1s/2s are misplaced (e.g., generated row2 has 1 at 5 but expected row2 all 0s except 1s at 3-4; row4 has 2s at 4-5 but expected row4 2s at 4-5 ok, but surrounding 1s wrong); frame is included but inverted, inner figure vertically shifted down by ~1 row (unknown reason, likely y-range starts too early).
 * Function `get_main_bbox` is helpful but broken when y-range is noisy (propagates errors); `find_main_y_range` is essential but insufficient (needs connectivity or size threshold); no unhelpful functions, but the composition in `program` assumes single main block—add component detection for multi-blob grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of normalization but misses subtle noise exclusion and precise component isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it extracts a partial figure (5s on sides, 3s/4s in middle) but places it starting from row1 (with row0 as [0s,3,3,0s] like noise or bottom fragment), repeats the pattern in rows1-2/4-5 but inverts or shifts (e.g., row2 has 3s at 4-8 but test input row? has different), adds isolated 3 in row6 middle, then pads with 7+ zero rows— this suggests wrong y-range (included top noise, excluded bottom?), incomplete bbox (missing left/right alignments, e.g., 5s at 0-1 and 11-12 but 3s not centered), and over-padding without centering. Expected likely a tight square of the central cross-like figure (3s horizontal, 4s vertical-ish, framed by 5s) translated to top-left without extras, possibly 7x7 or similar s<13, but output bloats to 13x13 with misplaced elements (e.g., duplicated rows 1/5 and 2/4 indicate loop error or wrong min_y). It fails to isolate the main "plus" shape, including apparent noise 3s, and doesn't match a clean normalized output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop a grid to focus on the "main" or central non-zero content (likely a symbol, digit, or pattern formed by numbers like 3, 5, 6, 8 representing filled pixels or segments), then pad it symmetrically with zeros to form a square grid of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, while preserving the relative positions and ensuring alignment matches the expected output. The process involves identifying contiguous rows with significant non-zero activity, computing tight column bounds within those rows, cropping, and centering via padding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping must use the tightest bounding box around the main object, but only for contiguous rows that form the core pattern—do not include isolated border rows or rows with minimal/sparse non-zeros if they are not part of the contiguous block, as this can shift the content left/right or include/exclude elements incorrectly.
 * Padding must be centered (even distribution on top/bottom and left/right), but the side length is the max of cropped height/width; however, if the input is already square-like, avoid over-padding or shifting the content asymmetrically.
 * Subtle element: The "main" row for starting the crop is the one with the highest non-zero count, but the contiguous block must extend only to rows where counts >0 without skipping zeros inside the object (but zeros inside are okay if part of the pattern); overlooking internal zero rows within the object can truncate it.
 * Grids may have border-like zeros or sparse rows (e.g., single non-zeros) that should be excluded from the crop to avoid including "frames" or artifacts, but the expected outputs sometimes retain specific sparse elements if they are integral to the pattern's edges.
 * Column bounds must be computed per the selected row range, but min/max columns should ignore empty rows within the range—easy to miss if bounds include padding from empty sub-rows.
 * Patterns involve numbers (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6/4/5 for fills), so treat all non-zero as "filled" for counting/bounds, but preserve exact values in output.
 * Inputs are rectangular lists of lists, outputs must be square and exactly match expected row-by-row, including zero placements.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return [[0]]; sparse patterns may require manual adjustment if auto-contiguous misses disconnected but related parts (though examples suggest patterns are contiguous).
 * From attempts: Row extension (start/end) works for dense centers but fails if the max-count row is not perfectly centered in the object, leading to asymmetric crops; padding functions are correct but applied after wrong crop, causing shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_count(row: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [row_nonzero_count(row) for row in g]

def find_max_count_row(counts: List[int]) -> int:
    if not counts:
        return 0
    max_i = 0
    max_c = counts[0]
    for i in range(1, len(counts)):
        if counts[i] > max_c:
            max_c = counts[i]
            max_i = i
    return max_i

def find_start_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    s = start
    while s > 0 and counts[s - 1] > 0:
        s -= 1
    return s

def find_end_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    e = start
    n = len(counts)
    while e < n - 1 and counts[e + 1] > 0:
        e += 1
    return e
```
These are helpful for identifying the core row range based on non-zero density.

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds

def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, n_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c

def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
These are useful for per-row and aggregate bounds, and basic cropping; they correctly compute min/max but fail if row range is wrong.

```python
def pad_columns(cropped: List[List[int]], target_width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_width = len(cropped[0])
    if current_width >= target_width:
        return cropped
    col_pad_left = (target_width - current_width) // 2
    col_pad_right = target_width - current_width - col_pad_left
    for r in range(len(cropped)):
        cropped[r] = [0] * col_pad_left + cropped[r] + [0] * col_pad_right
    return cropped

def pad_rows(cropped: List[List[int]], target_size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_height = len(cropped)
    if current_height >= target_size:
        return cropped
    row_pad_top = (target_size - current_height) // 2
    row_pad_bottom = target_size - current_height - row_pad_top
    size = len(cropped[0])
    for _ in range(row_pad_top):
        cropped.insert(0, [0] * size)
    for _ in range(row_pad_bottom):
        cropped.append([0] * size)
    return cropped
```
These handle symmetric padding well and are not broken—use them after fixing crop.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the max non-zero row and extends to contiguous non-zero rows, which works for dense central patterns but fails when the object has internal zero-count rows or when sparse edge rows (e.g., borders) should be excluded, leading to over-inclusion of empty space.
 * Cropping via row/column bounds is mostly right but computes min/max too broadly within the row range, including outliers from sparse rows, causing left-shifted content (e.g., in Train 1, generated row 0 has 3's at positions 2 and 4, but expected at 3 and 10, indicating wrong column start).
 * Padding to square is correct in logic (centered, max(h,w) side), but since crop is wrong, the final grid has shifted/misaligned patterns—e.g., Train 1 generated includes extra left zeros and wrong placements in rows 2-10 compared to expected (e.g., generated row 2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...], missing leading zeros and altering 3/8 positions).
 * Train 2 mismatches in row 1 (generated [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0], wrong 3 position) and row 3 (generated [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], extra 3's and shifted), suggesting column bounds grabbed too wide or wrong row range excluded top sparse rows.
 * Train 3 mismatches entirely in row ordering and content—generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips even/odd rows ([0,4,0,...] first), indicating the contiguous row finder or crop ignored the alternating border pattern, treating it as non-contiguous or wrong start row.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond bounds; a function to detect connected components (e.g., flood-fill for blobs) might help if patterns have disconnected parts, but current attempt lacks this—consider adding for future if contiguity fails.
 * The overall program(g) handles empty cases well but defaults to full grid crop if bounds fail, which over-pads without centering the true object.
 * Function `program` integrates everything but is broken due to row range logic—don't reuse without fixing start/end finders to skip zero-count rows outside the main block.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to crop/pad the entire input grid (13x13) with minimal trimming, resulting in large zero borders (e.g., rows 0-2 and 9-12 all zeros, content squeezed in rows 3-8 but shifted right with uneven columns, like 5's at edges but 3/4 patterns not centered). 
 * Compared to mentally running rules: The test input has a central cross-like pattern with 5's on sides, 3's in middle rows/columns, and a 4 in row 6 col 6; correct output should crop tightly to rows ~3-8 (height 6), columns ~3-9 (width 7, side=7), pad to 7x7 centered (e.g., add 0.5 rows top/bottom, 0 left/1 right), preserving exact 3/4/5 positions without the full 13x13 bloat or left/right shifts seen in generated (e.g., generated row 4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] includes outer 5's but expected would trim them if borders, centering the inner 3's and single 4).
 * It makes sense as a failed full-grid pad but not as correct extraction—missing tight crop leads to oversized zeros, and content alignment (e.g., 5's too far left in generated row 4) doesn't match a centered pattern; unknown why it didn't trim columns better, but likely because col_bounds took min_c=0 from edge 5's.

[2025-10-03 14:22:33] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input.

If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:26:29] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely pixel art or ASCII-like representations with numbers as colors/values) where the goal is to extract or crop the "main object" or central content from a larger grid that includes borders, frames, or extraneous zero-padded areas. The extraction should produce a subgrid that matches the expected "clean" or bounded version of the object, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while trimming surrounding zeros appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid always has fixed dimensions (e.g., 20 columns in example 1, 10 in others), but the main object does not span the full width or height; borders often consist of patterned zeros or repeating non-zeros (e.g., 3's or 5's forming frames).
 * Non-zero rows are not always fully consecutive; there may be isolated zero rows at the top/bottom that should be excluded, but the "longest block" approach misses cases where the object has internal zero rows or irregular shapes.
 * Column cropping must account for the tightest bounding box per row group, but min/max columns are calculated per row in the block—subtleties include asymmetric objects where left/right edges vary, and zeros within the object should be preserved (not trimmed internally).
 * Objects may have "legs" or extensions (e.g., in example 1, the bottom row has sparse 3's that differ in generated vs. expected), requiring per-row min/max rather than global for the block.
 * All examples show symmetric or framed structures (e.g., 5's as borders in example 2, 4's in example 3), so extraction should ignore outer frames and focus on inner content; however, frames may integrate with the object (e.g., 3's in example 1 seem part of the object).
 * Expected outputs preserve some leading/trailing zeros within rows to maintain shape (e.g., example 1 expected has [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] vs. generated [0,0,3,0,3,...]), indicating no global left-trimming—crop to the union of all non-zero positions across the relevant rows.
 * Subtle element: The "object" may span nearly all rows but exclude thin top/bottom zero rows; in example 3, the object is rotated or checkerboard-patterned, and extraction flips or reorders rows/columns incorrectly.
 * Consider connectivity: Non-zeros may form disconnected blobs, but examples suggest extracting the primary connected component (e.g., ignore small isolated elements).
 * Height of extracted grid varies (13 rows in example 1, 10 in others), so dynamically determine start/end rows based on first/last non-all-zero rows, not just longest block.
 * Numbers represent colors/types (e.g., 3=one type, 8=another), so preserve exact values; zeros are background.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a longest consecutive non-zero row block to determine height, which worked partially for examples 1 and 2 (captured most rows) but failed in example 3 by including extra patterned rows (e.g., generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected starts with [0,4,0,...], indicating wrong row order or selection).
 * Global min/max column calculation worked for rough width in example 1 (13 cols output) but produced incorrect content: e.g., train 1 generated first row [0,0,3,0,3,0,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...], missing a leading zero and including an extra 3 early—likely due to min_c=1 instead of 3, shifting the slice left.
 * In train 2, generated included extraneous elements like [0,3,3,0,4,...] in row 4 vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], showing the uniform slice didn't align with the inner object's varying left edges (e.g., expected has more leading zeros in some rows).
 * Train 3 generated a near-full grid but mismatched row order and content: e.g., first row [4,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,...], and internal rows like generated [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—suggests the block finder took wrong start/end, and column slicing ignored the checkerboard symmetry.
 * The has_non_zero function is solid and essential for row detection.
 * find_longest_block is partially helpful but broken for gapped or framed objects (e.g., misses that example 3 has alternating non-zero rows throughout).
 * find_min_col and find_max_col are flawed—not helpful as-is, since they compute global bounds but objects need per-row trimming or union bounds that preserve internal spacing; using them leads to shifted or squished outputs.
 * Overall program demonstrates basic bounding box understanding but ignores frame detection and per-row variation, causing all mismatches; no object extraction beyond crude cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same flawed longest-block + global min/max column slicing, producing 7 rows of width 13, but the content shows irregular 5's and 3's that seem like a partial frame or object (e.g., first row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,...] suggests top border, but middle rows like [5,5,0,3,3,3,...] include outer 5's that may be frame elements to exclude).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: e.g., symmetric 5-borders in rows 2,4,6 suggest the output included frame instead of cropping to inner 3/4 content; the sparse bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,...] looks like it trimmed too much vertically, missing potential object extensions.
 * The output has varying non-zero positions (e.g., 3's clustered in cols 5-9, 5's on edges), indicating the global slice shifted everything left (min_c too low), distorting the shape—likely incorrect as it doesn't preserve the "clean" inner object seen in training expecteds.
 * No way to confirm exact expected without rules, but it fails to handle frame-like 5's (similar to train 2's borders), so probably needs frame detection or better row selection to exclude top/bottom zeros properly.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 14:26:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 14:29:14] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def get_nonzero_cols_per_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    return [[j for j in range(n) if g[i][j] != 0] for i in range(n)]

def find_largest_square_block(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    n = len(g)
    nonzero_per_row = get_nonzero_cols_per_row(g)
    best_h = 0
    best_start = 0
    best_min_col = 0
    best_nz = 0
    for h in range(n, 0, -1):
        for s in range(n - h + 1):
            rows_nz = nonzero_per_row[s:s + h]
            if not any(rows_nz):
                continue
            min_c = min(min(r) for r in rows_nz if r)
            max_c = max(max(r) for r in rows_nz if r)
            w = max_c - min_c + 1
            nz = sum(len(r) for r in rows_nz)
            if w == h and nz > best_nz:
                best_h = h
                best_start = s
                best_min_col = min_c
                best_nz = nz
    return best_start, best_h, best_min_col

def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start: int, h: int, min_col: int) -> List[List[int]]:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:29:31] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving sparse grids of integers (likely representing colored cells or patterns), where the goal is to extract a cropped subgrid that captures the "main" figure or object while removing extraneous empty (zero) borders or padding, resulting in a tighter, possibly rectangular bounding area around the non-zero content. The extraction should preserve the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but trim outer empty rows/columns to focus on the core pattern, without forcing a square shape or including unnecessary whitespace.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids are often large (e.g., 18x18 or 19x19) with significant empty (zero) areas on the borders, especially left/right columns and top/bottom rows; the output must crop these dynamically to the minimal or near-minimal bounding rectangle enclosing all non-zero cells, but not so aggressively that internal zeros (part of the pattern) are removed.
 * Outputs are rectangular, not necessarily square—e.g., training example 1 expects 13x13 but with irregular non-zero distribution; forcing square shapes (as in the current program) leads to oversized or misaligned extractions that include padding.
 * Non-zero cells form connected or semi-connected "objects" (e.g., borders, shapes like 3's, 8's, 6's in train1; 5's, 3's, 4's in train2; 4's and inner patterns in train3), and the extraction should encompass the largest or primary object without fragmenting it or including disconnected outliers.
 * Internal zeros within the pattern must be preserved (e.g., gaps in shapes), but outer pure-zero rows/columns should be trimmed; subtle elements include asymmetric padding (more empty on left in train1) and potential for multiple disjoint objects (e.g., small isolated cells in test input like bottom-right 5's).
 * The puzzle may involve identifying a "frame" or border (e.g., alternating 4's in train3) as part of the core pattern, so cropping shouldn't remove structural edges unless they are fully empty.
 * Grids can have varying sizes, so the program must compute bounds dynamically rather than hardcoding; consider row/column spans of non-zeros, but account for cases where the "main" object doesn't span the full height/width (e.g., train2 has empty middle rows in output? No, output includes them if part of bounds).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs can have leading/trailing zeros in rows if they are part of the pattern's edge (e.g., train1 row1 starts/ends with zeros), but entire rows/columns of zeros on the perimeter should be omitted; also, rotation or reordering (seen in train3 mismatch) isn't needed—extraction is positional cropping.
 * Across attempts (only one shown, but implied iterations): Prioritize bounding box over density; handle varying grid sizes without assuming square; avoid maximizing non-zeros in a square, as it grabs too-wide areas with padding (e.g., train1 includes 5+ left zeros per row).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_nonzero_cols_per_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Useful: Computes active (non-zero) columns for each row, helping identify per-row spans without scanning full grid."""
    n = len(g)
    return [[j for j in range(n) if g[i][j] != 0] for i in range(n)]
```

```python
def find_bounding_rect(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    """Potentially helpful (not in current attempt): Finds min/max row and col indices with any non-zero to define crop bounds."""
    n = len(g)
    min_row, max_row = n, -1
    min_col, max_col = n, -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_row = min(min_row, i)
                max_row = max(max_row, i)
                min_col = min(min_col, j)
                max_col = max(max_col, j)
    return min_row, max_row + 1, min_col, max_col + 1  # Returns (start_row, end_row, start_col, end_col)
```

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_row: int, end_row: int, start_col: int, end_col: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Helpful: General cropper for rectangular subgrids; current version is square-only and broken for non-square needs."""
    return [[g[i][j] for j in range(start_col, end_col)] for i in range(start_row, end_row)]
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `find_largest_square_block`: Broken for this puzzle—forces square (w == h) and maximizes non-zero count within it, leading to padded or oversized extractions (e.g., grabs full-width with left zeros in train1); ignores rectangular bounds and includes empty rows/columns; not relevant, as puzzle outputs aren't strictly square.
 * Current `program`: Relies on square finder, so always fails on asymmetric patterns; extracts too much padding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown uses a square-focused approach, which worked partially by identifying dense non-zero areas (e.g., captured most of the 3/8/6 patterns in train1) but failed by including excessive left/top/bottom padding zeros, resulting in oversized/wider outputs (18 cols vs. expected 13 in train1; 15 vs. 10 in train2).
 * Train1: Generated a near-full grid with 5+ leading zeros per row and extra bottom empty rows, mismatching expected cropped version (starts trimming at col 3, ends at col 15-ish, removes left empty block); unknown why it picked h=11 starting at row 0, but it over-included empties; nz maximization grabbed too-wide span (min_c=6, w=11? but still padded).
 * Train2: Generated included extra left/right empties and mismatched row lengths (15 vs. 10), capturing 5/3/4 patterns but with padding (e.g., leading zeros in rows); failed to crop tightly around the central object, adding irrelevant empty rows at bottom.
 * Train3: Generated almost the full 10x10 but with rows 1-2 swapped and inner pattern misaligned (e.g., row3 has [4,0,0,0,0,1,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,...]), suggesting wrong start/min_col (perhaps picked h=10, s=0, min_c=0 including border but shifting?); close in size but positionally wrong, missing subtle inner crop.
 * extract_subgrid is mostly helpful but limited to square (h-wide); get_nonzero_cols_per_row is essential for span detection but underused (only for min/max col, not full bounds).
 * Overall: Missed rectangular cropping; considered density over bounds; no handling for asymmetric empties; train samples all failed due to padding inclusion; function forcing square is incorrect (don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it extracts a very wide (19 cols?) rectangular strip starting from the left, including massive empty padding (e.g., rows 1-5 have 3-18 leading zeros before any non-zero like 5 or 3), and captures disjoint elements (top-left 3's, mid-right 5's block, bottom 3/4/5 patterns) without tight cropping, resulting in a sparse, non-focused grid that doesn't isolate a "main" figure.
 * It mismatches what a correct output should be: mentally, the test input has a small top-left 3/5 cluster (rows 0-4, cols 0-3), a mid-right 5's block (rows 6-8, cols 11-14), a large bottom-center 3/4/5 object (rows 10-14, cols 6-17), and scattered bottom 5's (rows 17-18); a correct extraction likely needs to bound the largest/dominant object (bottom 3/4/5, ~5x12), cropping to ~ rows 10-15, cols 6-18, yielding a tighter 6x13 with preserved internals, not the full padded mess; current output includes irrelevant top empties and doesn't focus, making it look like a raw dump rather than a puzzle solution.

[2025-10-03 14:29:32] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract or crop a subgrid from a larger input grid (likely square, with dimensions around 10-13 based on examples) that captures the "core" or primary patterned object(s) formed by non-zero numbers, while excluding border padding, empty rows/columns, or extraneous elements. The output should be a rectangular or square subgrid that matches the expected structure exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of the numbers (which seem to represent colors, labels, or connected components like blobs/shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid contains non-zero numbers (e.g., 3,8,6 in train1; 5,3,4 in train2; 4,1,2 in train3) arranged in patterns that likely form distinct "objects" or shapes, surrounded by zeros acting as background or padding; the task is to isolate the bounding box of the main object(s), but not just any dense area—subtleties include handling irregular shapes, multiple components, and ensuring the crop aligns precisely with the expected layout (e.g., including specific zero placements within the object).
 * Outputs must match the expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected is 13 rows x 13 columns, but generated is 12x12; train2 expected 10x10, generated 10x10 but content wrong; train3 expected 10x10 with rotated/shifted elements, generated 9x9?); mismatches in size indicate failure to detect the correct span or padding.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have "borders" or frames (e.g., 3's outlining in train1, 5's in train2/train3), internal zeros that are part of the shape (not to be cropped out), and asymmetric placements (e.g., objects not centered, with uneven padding); vertical and horizontal cropping must consider the minimal bounding box that includes all relevant non-zeros without trimming internal structure.
 * Connected components or spans: Non-zeros form blobs (e.g., 8's as one shape, 6's as another in train1), and the crop should encompass the largest or primary blob(s); however, it's not just max span—expected outputs shift or select specific alignments (e.g., train1 expected starts columns later, includes extra row/column with sparse 3's).
 * Padding and zeros: Expected outputs retain some outer zeros if they are part of the frame (e.g., train1 expected has leading/trailing zeros in rows), but exclude large empty borders; generated outputs often over-crop or misalign, removing necessary zeros or adding incorrect padding.
 * Multiple objects: Grids may have hierarchical or adjacent shapes (e.g., train1 has 3-frame around 8/6 innards; train2 has 5-frame with internal 3/4; train3 has 4-frame with internal 1/2), requiring the crop to include the enclosing frame without fragmenting internals.
 * Vertical selection: Not all rows with max horizontal span are equal; expected selects a contiguous block but shifted (e.g., train1 generated starts at row 1, expected includes row 0 and 12 with sparse elements).
 * Horizontal alignment: Left edge is not always the global min column; it must align to the frame's start (e.g., train1 generated left=1 based on min_first, but expected left=3 with more leading zeros).
 * Density vs. structure: Summing non-zero counts for vertical selection works partially but fails when multiple candidate blocks have similar sums; expected prioritizes structural integrity over max density.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero rows/columns in output only if they frame the object (e.g., train3 expected has patterned borders); test input has scattered 5/3/4 patterns, likely needing a crop that captures a central cross-like or framed shape.
 * Overall: The puzzle emphasizes exact reproduction of the "visible" core image, possibly from a larger canvas with margins; failures often stem from incorrect bounding box calculation, ignoring frame elements, or wrong vertical/horizontal slicing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes some potentially useful primitives for analysis, but they are flawed in application.

```python
from typing import List

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is helpful for measuring row density, useful for vertical block selection, but insufficient alone as it ignores column-wise or structural alignment.)

```python
def get_span(row: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    first = None
    for i in range(n):
        if row[i] != 0:
            first = i
            break
    if first is None:
        return 0
    last = None
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if row[i] != 0:
            last = i
            break
    return last - first + 1 if last is not None else 0
```
(This computes the width of the non-zero segment in a row, helpful for identifying max pattern size horizontally, but misses multi-segment rows or frame detection; could be extended for column spans.)

No other types or tools are provided; future attempts might benefit from functions to find bounding boxes (min/max row/col with non-zeros), detect connected components (e.g., flood fill for blobs), or compute minimal enclosing rectangle for specific values (e.g., trace 3-frames).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt provided, which attempts a cropping strategy based on max horizontal spans and vertical density sums, but all training examples fail due to dimensional mismatches (e.g., train1 generated 12x12 vs. expected 13x13) and content errors (e.g., wrong left alignment, missing sparse frame rows).
 * Worked partially: Horizontal span detection identifies a reasonable size (e.g., captures width of main patterns), and vertical density sum selects a dense block (e.g., train1 generated includes core 8/6 rows 2-10, which overlap expected).
 * Did not work: Over-relies on max span rows for left alignment (e.g., train1 min_first=1 from row1's 3, but expected left=3 to include more padding and align frame); vertical selection picks wrong start (e.g., train1 best_start=1, skipping row0's sparse 3's and excluding row12); adds incorrect padding in rows (e.g., train1 generated pads short rows with zeros on right, but expected has exact 13 cols without padding); ignores overall grid symmetry or frame tracing.
 * Train1: Generated shifts left edge too far left (starts at col1 with 0,0,3 vs. expected col3 with 0,0,0,3), includes wrong row block (rows1-12, missing top/bottom sparse rows, extra dense row10 that's not in expected block), and trims to 12 cols (loses right 3's); differences include misplaced 8's/6's (e.g., generated row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs. expected row2: [0,3,0,8,0,8,...])—unknown why exact positions mismatch, possibly due to wrong left/right calc.
 * Train2: Generated has correct 10x10 size but wrong content (e.g., row3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—generated fills internal zeros incorrectly, shifts 3's/4's leftward); includes row1 as [0,0,0,3,...] but expected has it as empty-ish [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]; vertical block starts too early, capturing wrong frame alignment.
 * Train3: Generated appears 9x9 (rows listed as 9, but code aims for size=9?), with shifted borders (e.g., row0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] vs. expected row9: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—seems rotated or flipped incorrectly); internal 1/2 placements wrong (e.g., row4: [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4] vs. expected row4: [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—generated adds extra leading 4's, loses padding); function get_span likely picks wrong max_s (9 vs. expected 10, trimming borders).
 * The core program(g) function is broken for dimension handling (assumes square crop of max_s, pads incorrectly, selects suboptimal vertical block); count_nonzeros and get_span are helpful but not sufficient—need better bounding box or frame detection; avoid overusing density sums without structural checks, as it leads to dense-but-misaligned crops.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears malformed/incomplete for the puzzle: it has 13 rows but varying lengths (some 13 elems, but structure is ragged); includes large empty rows (e.g., row2 all zeros, row10 all zeros), which likely shouldn't be in a core crop unless framing, but here they disrupt the pattern; the visible parts show a scattered 5/3/4 arrangement (e.g., row4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] seems like a horizontal bar, row6: [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] with a 4 insert), but it's vertically spread with empties, suggesting wrong vertical block selection (probably picked a non-contiguous or padded block including borders).
 * Differences from expected (mentally simulated): Assuming test input has a central framed object with 5's as outer, 3's/4's inner (based on scattered non-zeros around center), expected should be a tight ~9-11x13 crop centering the cross/bar patterns without full empty rows (e.g., exclude top/bottom empties, align left to first 5/3 col ~4, right to last ~12); generated includes too many leading/trailing zeros per row and wrong row selection (e.g., starts with sparse row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0], but likely expected skips to denser block starting row4); it fails to capture a cohesive shape, outputting a "smeared" version with isolated elements—does not make sense as a core extraction, missing subtle frame alignment (e.g., 5's not properly bordering 3/4's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely binary or simple numeric grids representing shapes or objects), where the goal is to identify and extract the "main" contiguous block or object (defined by non-zero cells), crop it to its minimal bounding box, and then pad it symmetrically to form a square grid of appropriate size, preserving the object's structure for further puzzle-solving or recognition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of rows of integers (likely 0s for empty space and non-zero values like 1s for filled cells in an object or shape).
 * Identify the "main block" by finding the row with the highest density of non-zero cells, then extend contiguously up and down to include all adjacent non-zero rows, assuming the object is a single connected vertical block without gaps.
 * After selecting rows, compute the tightest column bounds across those rows by finding the global min/first non-zero column and max/last non-zero column, ignoring fully zero rows or columns.
 * Crop to the bounding box (subgrid of selected rows and columns), then pad with zeros to make it square: first pad columns to match the max of height/width, centering the content; then pad rows similarly if needed.
 * Edge cases include empty grids (return a single [[0]] or similar minimal square), grids where the object doesn't span all columns/rows, or where non-zero counts are zero (handle gracefully without errors).
 * Subtlety: Padding must be centered (equal or floor/ceil split on both sides) to maintain visual symmetry, and the final size should be the max of the cropped height/width, not hardcoded.
 * Assume the grid is rectangular (all rows same length), but the object may not fill the entire grid—avoid including sparse or disconnected parts.
 * Non-zero cells might vary in value (e.g., different numbers for shading), but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding and cropping.
 * Potential for multiple objects: The code assumes one main block via max density row, but puzzles might require selecting the largest/densest without merging disconnected components.

        cropped.append([0] * size)
    return cropped
```
These functions handle row density calculation, block selection, per-row bounds, cropping, and centered padding effectively, and can be reused or minimally fixed for future attempts.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Compute global min first and max last over selected rows."""
    min_c = len(bounds[0][0]) if bounds else 0  # Use a large number  # BROKEN: bounds[0][0] is int, len(int) errors
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
This function is broken due to attempting len() on an int (should initialize min_c to a large value like len(g[0]) instead of len(bounds[0][0])), causing runtime errors on all inputs; it cannot be used as-is and needs fixing to compute column bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the core logic of finding a dense contiguous row block via non-zero counts and extending boundaries, which aligns with extracting a main object.
 * Row and column bound calculation (via get_row_bounds) works in principle for tight cropping, and padding functions ensure centered square output, which seems essential for visual puzzles.
 * However, the entire program fails to execute due to a bug in compute_col_bounds (len() on int), producing errors instead of grids for all cases—nothing "works" in terms of runnable output.
 * Block selection assumes vertical contiguity without gaps, which may miss horizontal-only or disconnected objects, but it's a reasonable start if the puzzle focuses on single blobs.
 * Cropping and padding are applied in the right order (columns first, then rows), but untested due to the crash.
 * No extraction of multiple objects or handling of varying non-zero values beyond binary count; assumes one main block, which might overlook puzzles with noise or multiple components.
 * The main function handles empty grids minimally, but the error prevents verification.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding of cropping/padding to square but zero progress on execution, as all attempts (this one) crash identically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or produce a valid grid—it indicates a runtime failure rather than an incorrect but runnable result.
 * No actual grid is generated, so it cannot match any expected cropped/padded square for the test input; the error occurs early in compute_col_bounds, preventing any output.
 * This differs from expectations (a padded square grid representing the main object) because the code crashes instead of processing the grid; likely the test input has a valid non-empty grid, but the bug blocks all progress.
 * Without seeing the test grid, the error suggests the code isn't robust to standard inputs (e.g., non-empty bounds tuples), and future fixes must ensure no type mismatches to handle the test case properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop and normalize a larger input grid (likely 20x20 with non-zero elements forming visual "objects" or patterns in the top portion) into the smallest possible square grid that tightly bounds all non-zero cells, by shifting the content to start at position (0,0) and padding the rest with zeros to make it square (using the maximum of the bounding height and width as the side length). The output preserves the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but eliminates empty space around the edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids appear to be 20x20, but non-zero content is confined to the top ~16 rows (rows 0-15), with rows 16-19 likely being empty or irrelevant (e.g., a footer or padding); however, hardcoding "i < 16" in min/max calculations risks excluding valid content if it spills over or if the rule is more flexible.
 * Compute the bounding box by finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices with any non-zero value; height = max_r - min_r + 1, width = max_c - min_c + 1; side length s = max(height, width) to ensure a square output.
 * Shift all non-zero cells by subtracting min_r from their row index and min_c from their column index, placing them in a new s x s grid starting at (0,0); any cells that would fall outside after shifting are discarded (though this hasn't occurred in examples).
 * Outputs are printed as lists of integers (one per row), with the number of lists indicating the grid height (which should equal s); all outputs must be square, but the provided generated outputs vary in size and include unnecessary empty rows/columns.
 * Subtlety: Disconnected components or scattered non-zeros (e.g., in train3, there are separate 1's, 4's, and 2's) must all be included in the single bounding box—no extraction of individual "objects"; the entire non-zero content is treated as one unit.
 * Easy to miss: Padding must be zeros only outside the shifted bounding box; do not alter values or introduce new non-zeros; if the bounding box is empty or all zeros, output a 0x0 or minimal grid, but examples have content.
 * Grids may have irregular shapes (e.g., train1 has a frame-like 3's with internal 8's, 6's; train2 has nested shapes with 5's as borders), so min/max must scan every cell accurately without assuming connectivity.
 * Outputs in examples are rectangular in print but should represent square grids (e.g., train2 expected is 10x10, but printed as 10 lists of 10 ints); ensure no trailing empty rows/columns in the final grid.
 * The program ignores rows >=16 entirely in min/max, which works if content is always top-heavy but fails if not; also, if min_r ==20 (all empty in top 16), it returns 0, which may pad incorrectly.
 * No rotation, scaling, or value changes—just translation to top-left and squaring.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions for finding min/max row/col and shifting are conceptually useful but buggy (e.g., hardcoded i<16 limits scanning; compute_size is correct but simplistic; shift_and_place discards out-of-bounds but doesn't handle empty cases well). Here's a refined version without the row limit, using full 20x20 scan:

```python
from typing import List

def find_min_r(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    min_r = len(g)  # Assume 20
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, i)
                break  # Optimize: once row has non-zero, it's min
    return min_r if min_r < len(g) else 0  # 0 if empty?

def find_max_r(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    max_r = -1
    for i in range(len(g) - 1, -1, -1):  # Scan from bottom for efficiency
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                max_r = i
                break
    return max_r if max_r >= 0 else 0

# Similar for find_min_c and find_max_c, scanning columns fully without i<16 limit

def compute_size(h: int, w: int) -> int:
    return max(h, w) if h > 0 and w > 0 else 0  # Handle empty case

def create_empty_grid(s: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[0] * s for _ in range(s)] if s > 0 else []

def shift_and_place(g: List[List[int]], new_grid: List[List[int]], min_r: int, min_c: int, s: int) -> None:
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                ni = i - min_r
                nj = j - min_c
                if 0 <= ni < s and 0 <= nj < s:
                    new_grid[ni][nj] = g[i][j]
```

No types like PuzzleElement are needed; simple grid ops suffice. Function to extract all non-zero positions could help verify bounding box:

```python
def get_nonzero_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    positions = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                positions.append((i, j))
    return positions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used a bounding box approach but hardcoded row scans to i<16, which excluded potential content below row 15 and led to incorrect min_r/max_r in cases with bottom content (though examples seem top-confined, it still failed due to sizing/shifting bugs).
 * What worked: Shifting logic in shift_and_place correctly translates cells relative to min_r/min_c; compute_size correctly makes square by max(h,w); it identified non-zeros and avoided overwriting.
 * What didn't work: Hardcoded i<16 in all find_* functions ignored rows 16-19, but even if content is there, it caused oversized s (e.g., if min_r=0, h=16ish, s large); returned 0 for empty scans but didn't handle s=0 properly, leading to empty or mismatched grids.
 * Train1: Generated a ~13x13 grid but misplaced elements—e.g., row0 has [0,0,3,0,3,...] (two 3's too early) vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] (single 3 later); internal 8's and 6's shifted wrong, with extra 3's in row2 and missing shifts in lower rows; overall, bounding box too loose, including phantom space on left/top.
 * Train2: Generated ~15x15 with lots of empty rows/columns (e.g., many leading/trailing 0's per row, and empty rows at bottom); expected is tight 10x10—e.g., generated row0 [0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,...] has scattered 5's not shifted to tight bound, while expected starts with [5,0,5,...] packed left; 3's and 4's misaligned, with extra padding.
 * Train3: Generated ~14x14 with excessive empties (e.g., many all-zero rows at top/middle); expected 10x10 tight—e.g., generated has isolated 1's and 4's spread out (row0 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,...] vs expected starting directly with [0,4,0,4,...]); alternating 4's not packed, 2's blob shifted incorrectly, leading to loose bounds.
 * No object extraction function was used or needed; the attempt treated the whole grid as one, which is correct, but didn't verify with something like get_nonzero_positions to debug bounds.
 * Function find_min_r etc. are helpful but broken due to i<16—remove limit; shift_and_place is useful but should check for empty input (s=0) to return empty list.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The hardcoded row limit makes all scans incomplete; compute_size returns max even if h=0, potentially giving s=w but wrong if empty; no handling for non-square inputs leading to oversized outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it generates a nearly full 19x19 grid (19 rows listed, many with 19 elements) filled mostly with zeros and scattered non-zeros (e.g., 5's in columns 3-4 early on, 3's at bottom-left, 4 in row12 col12), but fails to tightly bound or shift: e.g., non-zeros span from row2 (3's) to row15 (3's), columns 2-18, but output includes huge empty top/left/right/bottom padding instead of cropping to ~14x17 then squaring to 17x17 and shifting everything to top-left.
 * It looks incorrect because the bounding box isn't computed tightly (likely due to i<16 including too much empty space above/below, or wrong min_r=0 assuming full height); shifted positions are off—e.g., the cluster of 3's/5's/4 in rows10-15 cols9-18 should pack to row0 col0 start, but remains offset; extra empty rows (e.g., rows5-6,8-9 all zeros) bloat the size unnecessarily.
 * Does not make sense: Expected should be a compact square (s~10-14 based on visible clusters: vertical 5's early, horizontal 3's/5's bottom), with all non-zeros contiguous from (0,0), no scattered empties inside bounds; this output retains input layout too closely without proper crop/shift, suggesting the i<16 bug or full-grid scan without true min/max.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels or labeled regions in a visual drawing) to isolate and output a cropped, centered, and square-padded version of the primary "object" or content, excluding backgrounds, frames, or extraneous elements. The goal appears to be tight bounding box cropping around the meaningful visual element, followed by padding to a square, but the exact definition of the "primary object" (e.g., excluding connected borders or frames) is key to matching expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids contain numbers like 0 (background), 3 (possibly a frame or border color), 4/5/6/8 (object colors), and the output must preserve these values exactly while adjusting positions via cropping/padding.
 * Connected components are 8-directional (including diagonals), which is correctly implemented, but the "largest" component may include unwanted frames (e.g., surrounding 3's in train1 and test), leading to overly broad bounding boxes that shift or include extra elements.
 * Cropping must be precise to the minimal bounding box of the intended object; padding centers the cropped content in a square of side max(height, width) of the crop, with 0's filling edges, but misalignment occurs if the bbox is wrong (e.g., generated outputs shift rows/columns relative to expected).
 * Subtle elements: Outer frames (e.g., 3's in train1/test) seem treated as background to exclude, not part of the object; multiple components exist (e.g., separate blobs of 4/6/8), so largest-by-size may grab the frame instead of the inner drawing. In train2/3, rotations or symmetries in borders (5's/4's) suggest excluding perimeter patterns. Padding must not introduce asymmetries; expected outputs often have irregular padding (e.g., more 0's on one side).
 * All non-zero cells aren't always the object—likely need to ignore border-like structures (e.g., full rows/columns of same number). Outputs are always square-padded but dimensions vary (13x13 for train1, 10x10 for train2/3, 7x7 for test).
 * Easy to miss: Component size counts cells, but frames may be larger; bbox updates must track min/max accurately during flood-fill. No rotation or flipping seems needed, but symmetries in inputs (e.g., test's H-like 3's with inner 4) imply symmetric cropping.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes largest component is the target, which fails; need to perhaps find bbox of all non-zero or subtract frame. Outputs must match expected exactly, including 0 placements—no tolerance for shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_largest_component_bbox(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    # (as provided: flood-fills 8-connected components to find largest by cell count, tracks bbox)

    # Core logic is sound for post-bbox processing; ensures square output. Subtle issue: assumes input indices valid, but works if bbox correct. Helpful for final formatting.
    pass
```

# No other functions in attempt; could add:

    # Alternative: min/max over all non-zero cells (ignores connectivity); might capture full content without component bias.

                min_c = min(min_c, c)
                max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c if min_r <= max_r else (0, 0, 0, 0)
```
* No unhelpful/broken functions in attempt; the provided ones are relevant but insufficient alone (e.g., find_largest_component_bbox grabs wrong region).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Single attempt shown: All three training examples failed due to incorrect bbox selection, leading to shifted or inclusive cropping that mismatches expected positions and includes/excludes wrong elements.
 * Train1: Generated crops to a 13x13 square including a full 3's frame and inner elements, but bbox starts too left/early (e.g., row1 has 3 at col3 and col5, vs expected's 3's at col4 and col11; row3 has 8's starting col3 vs expected col4; overall, generated includes extra top-left 3's and misaligns bottom rows like row10 having 8's where expected has 0's). What worked: Correctly identifies connected 3/8/6 regions and pads to square. What didn't: Largest component is the 3's frame (connected around edges), bloating bbox and shifting content right/down vs expected (which seems to crop tighter around inner 8/6 with partial 3's).
 * Train2: Generated 10x10 crops include 5's border and inner 3/4, but misaligns (e.g., row2 has 3's starting col4 vs expected row2 all 0's except col7=3; row4 has 3's at col2/3 and 4 at col5/6 vs expected row4 3's at col3 and 4's shifted right; includes extra 5's on right). What worked: Padding logic centers roughly. What didn't: Grabs 5's frame as part of largest component, causing vertical/horizontal shifts; expected excludes some 0-rows and adjusts for inner 3/4 blob, possibly treating 5's as background.
 * Train3: Generated 10x10 includes 4's border and inner 1/2, but rotates or shifts borders (e.g., row1 starts with 4,0,4,... vs expected row1 0,4,0,...; row3 has 1 at col4 vs expected row3 1's at col4/5 but different 0 placements; overall, generated seems to crop from a different origin, including extra 4's on edges). What worked: 8-connected flood-fill correctly groups 1/2/4. What didn't: Largest component includes perimeter 4's (alternating pattern), leading to bbox that flips or misaligns symmetries; expected tightens to inner 1/2 with minimal border, suggesting frame exclusion.
 * General: Attempt understands connected components and bbox/padding, but misses that frames (3/5/4 borders) are not the "object"—need to detect/exclude them (e.g., via perimeter check or non-largest component). No extraction of "objects" beyond largest; could add frame detection. Unknown why shifts occur exactly (possibly bbox min_r/min_c off by 1-2 due to frame inclusion).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (7x7) does not look correct: It crops to include the full 3's frame (forming an H or window shape) with inner 4, but bbox seems too broad/left-aligned (e.g., row1 [0,0,3,3,0,0,0] includes left 3's cluster; row7 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0] has bottom-right 3 isolated). Expected likely tighter around the central 4 and symmetric 3's arms, excluding outer 0's or frame edges—e.g., should center the 4 at ~row4/col4 with balanced 3's padding, matching train patterns where frames are partially omitted/shifted (e.g., more 0's on sides, no full border inclusion). This fails similarly to trainings by treating the 3's frame as the primary component; to fix, exclude perimeter-connected 3's or use overall non-zero bbox for tighter fit.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract the primary cluster or "object" of non-zero values from a sparse grid, crop to its tight bounding box (excluding distant outliers), translate the content to the top-left corner, and pad with zeros to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and shapes of the non-zero elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The primary task is outlier removal by selecting the densest contiguous block of rows with the most non-zeros, then cropping columns to the minimal bounding box that covers non-zeros only within that row block—this excludes scattered or distant elements (e.g., isolated 8's at the bottom in train1 or isolated 3's/4's in train2).
 * After cropping, translate the content to top-left (no leading zero rows or columns before the first non-zero), then pad to the smallest square size using zeros, but padding appears to be added only as needed on the right and bottom (not centered), maintaining the top-left alignment of the main cluster.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have multiple disconnected components (e.g., borders, stray pixels like the top-left 8's in train1 or bottom 5's in train2); only the main dense cluster should be kept, ignoring low-density or isolated parts. Padding must not introduce artificial centering that shifts the content away from top-left. Row/column counts must handle empty rows/columns correctly without including them in the bounding box. The output square size is determined by the max of cropped height and width, with uneven padding (e.g., more on one side if odd difference).
 * Considerations across attempts: Prefix sums for efficient max subarray sum on row densities work well for finding dense blocks but fail if the "best" block includes empty internal rows incorrectly or if column cropping leaks outliers from outside the row block. Centered padding breaks top-left alignment, leading to extra zeros on left/top. No handling for cases with no non-zeros (should return minimal [[0]]). Grids can be rectangular input but output must be square. Values like 3,5,8,4,6,1,2 are treated as non-zero "filled" pixels without regard to their specific numbers—only presence matters for density/cropping.
 * Easy-to-miss: The expected outputs preserve exact relative positions within the crop (no rotation/scaling), and the square padding is minimal (e.g., train1 expected is 13x13, not larger). Isolated single rows/columns of non-zeros (e.g., bottom 5's in train3) are outliers to ignore. If multiple dense blocks exist, pick the one with max total non-zeros, allowing internal empties but not extending to sparse ends.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    """Count the number of non-zero elements in a row."""
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is helpful for density calculations and works correctly.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Compute non-zero counts for each row in the grid."""
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preparing data for block selection.)

```python
def get_prefix_sums(counts: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Compute prefix sums of row counts for efficient range sum queries."""
    prefix = [0]
    for c in counts:
        prefix.append(prefix[-1] + c)
    return prefix
```
(Very helpful for O(n^2) max subarray sum to find densest row block efficiently; core to outlier removal.)

```python
def find_max_sum_row_block(prefix: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the contiguous row block with the maximum total non-zeros (allows internal empty rows)."""
    n = len(prefix) - 1
    max_sum = 0
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 2):
            current_sum = prefix[j - 1] - prefix[i]
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_start = i
                best_end = j - 2  # Adjust for prefix indexing
    return best_start, best_end
```
(Helpful for selecting the main row block but buggy in indexing—best_end = j-2 can cause off-by-one errors leading to included/excluded rows; still useful as a base for density-based selection.)

```python
def find_col_bounds(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the minimal and maximal column indices with non-zeros in the row block."""
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g and g[0] else 0
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    has_nonzero = False
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i]
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                min_c = min(min_c, j)
                max_c = max(max_c, j)
                has_nonzero = True
    if not has_nonzero:
        return 0, 0
    return min_c, max_c
```
(Helpful for column cropping within the selected rows; correctly ignores zeros but assumes uniform column length—works well if no outliers outside row block.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Crop the grid to the specified row and column range (preserves relative positions)."""
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row_slice = g[i][min_c:max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row_slice)
    return cropped
```
(Helpful and correct for extracting the subgrid; preserves exact values and positions.)

The following function is broken/not helpful:
```python
def pad_to_square_size(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Pad the cropped grid to a square by adding zero rows and columns centered (global translation and padding rule)."""
    # ... (centered padding logic)
```
(This is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle: it centers padding, shifting content away from top-left, which mismatches all expectations; replace with top-left padding to right/bottom.)

```python
def remove_outliers_by_block(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Select the densest row block to exclude distant outliers (outlier removal rule)."""
    # Composes the above but inherits bugs from find_max_sum_row_block and lacks top-left translation.
```
(Partially helpful as a composer but overall broken due to no translation step after crop and buggy block selection.)

No types like classes are used; simple List[List[int]] for grids is sufficient. No extraction of "objects" beyond density-based cropping is needed—treating the grid as a binary image (non-zero vs zero) for bounding box is key.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the need for density-based row block selection (using max subarray sum on row non-zero counts) to remove outliers, which works conceptually for excluding sparse rows (e.g., empty rows in train1).
 * What worked: Prefix sum approach efficiently finds contiguous dense rows; column bounding correctly tightens width to non-zeros in the block; cropping preserves relative positions and values.
 * What didn't work: All three training examples failed completely—generated outputs include extra padding, outliers, and wrong sizes/shifts. For train1, generated a oversized ~19x19 grid with centered padding, including bottom 8's as outliers and extra left/top zeros, vs expected 13x13 top-left cropped main 3/8 figure (missing bottom padding row and left zeros in some places). For train2, generated ~17x17 with stray 3's/4's/5's not cropped out, centered, and wrong row order/alignment vs expected 10x10 tight crop of central 5/3/4 cluster. For train3, generated mostly zeros with scattered remnants (e.g., isolated 1's and bottom 4's not excluded), oversized, vs expected 10x10 tight alternating 4/1/2 pattern cropped from middle.
 * Missed top-left translation after cropping (generated has centered zeros on left/top); buggy best_end indexing in find_max_sum_row_block likely includes/excludes wrong rows (e.g., train1 includes too many empty rows). Centered padding is a core mismatch—always shifts content incorrectly. No handling for multiple candidate blocks (always picks max but may pick wrong if ties). Function pad_to_square_size is incorrect/not relevant (causes all alignment failures; avoid in future). Overall, partial understanding of cropping but fails on alignment/padding, leading to no training passes. extract_objects-like logic isn't present but density cropping approximates it helpfully.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to be an uncropped or partially processed ~19x19 grid including multiple disconnected clusters (e.g., top scattered 3/5/4's, middle 3/4/5's, bottom 5's) without tight bounding, top-left alignment, or square padding; it has irregular leading zeros per row and preserves full input width/sparsity, suggesting the program applied loose row block selection but failed column crop or padding entirely (e.g., includes empty columns and distant 5's at bottom-right). This mismatches the pattern from trainings, where outputs should be small tight squares (~10-13 size) with only the densest central cluster (likely the middle 3/4/5 block here, cropped to ~8x10 then padded to 10x10 top-left). It looks like a near-input copy with some row selection but no real processing, so incorrect—likely due to indexing bugs including extra rows/columns and no translation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract and normalize the core "image" or content from sparse 2D grids filled with numbers representing pixels or symbols, likely by cropping out surrounding empty (zero) space and centering/padding the result into a square format while preserving the relative positions and asymmetries of the non-zero elements. The goal is to produce a tight, centered bounding box of the active content without distorting shapes, but the current program over-crops or misaligns columns/rows, leading to shifted or incomplete representations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids represent visual patterns (e.g., shapes or symbols made of numbers like 3,8,6,5,4,1), and the output must preserve exact relative positions of non-zeros, including asymmetries (e.g., in training example 1, the top row's 3s are not symmetrically placed, and internal "gaps" like zero rows or columns within the content must not be cropped out if they are structural).
 * Cropping should use the global min/max row and column indices of all non-zero cells across the entire grid, not just the longest contiguous block of non-empty rows—this misses disconnected or gapped components (e.g., borders or separate objects).
 * Padding must be centered (equal or near-equal on both sides) to make a square of side max(height, width) of the cropped grid, but only after accurate cropping; over-padding or incorrect min/max leads to shifted content.
 * Empty rows/columns on the borders should be fully removed, but internal empties (e.g., in training example 2's row 1 or 8) are part of the design and must stay.
 * Subtle asymmetries in expected outputs (e.g., training example 1's bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] vs. generated [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]; training example 3's row orders are swapped in places) suggest the puzzle may involve orientation or specific "framing" rules, but cropping must not reorder or flip.
 * All non-zero values (regardless of their number, e.g., 3 as border, 8/6 as fills) define the bounds; zeros inside are intentional spaces, not to be filled.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 13x13 for train1, 10x10 for others), and output should match input dimensions if square, but centered padding ensures squareness.
 * Potential multiple "objects" (e.g., borders around inner shapes in train3), so bounding box must encompass all, not just the densest area.
 * Edge cases: Fully empty grids return [[0]]; uneven padding (e.g., (s - dim) // 2 for one side) to handle odd differences.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is useful for identifying non-empty rows but insufficient alone for global bounds; better for scanning density.)

```python
def first_nonzero(row: List[int]) -> int:
    for j in range(len(row)):
        if row[j] != 0:
            return j
    return len(row)
```
(Helpful for left-edge detection per row; extend to global min_col by taking min over all rows' first_nonzero.)

```python
def last_nonzero(row: List[int]) -> int:
    for j in range(len(row) - 1, -1, -1):
        if row[j] != 0:
            return j
    return -1
```
(Helpful for right-edge detection per row; extend to global max_col by taking max over all rows' last_nonzero.)
```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is good: compute global min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c from all non-zeros
    # Then crop: [row[min_c:max_c+1] for row in g[start:end+1]]
    # Then pad to s = max(h, w) centered, as done (pad_left = (s - w)//2, etc.)
    # But replace contiguous block logic with full scan:
    n, m = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    min_r, max_r = n, -1
    min_c, max_c = m, -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, i)
                max_r = max(max_r, i)
                min_c = min(min_c, j)
                max_c = max(max_c, j)
    if max_r < 0:
        return [[0]]
    cropped = [row[min_c:max_c+1] for row in g[min_r:max_r+1]]
    # Rest of padding logic as-is
```
(This improved version uses full bounding box; original's contiguous rows fail on gapped content.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies non-empty rows and pads to a square centered, which works for basic symmetry and size normalization (e.g., outputs are square-ish and zero-padded).
 * However, it fails to compute accurate column bounds (min_c/max_c) by only scanning a contiguous row block, leading to left-shifted content (e.g., in train1, generated starts 3s at column 2 instead of 3, and includes extra left zeros while missing right placements like the final 3 in row 0).
 * Longest contiguous non-empty rows logic ignores global content, cropping out top/bottom elements (e.g., train1 generated omits or shifts the asymmetric 3s in expected row 0 and 12; train2 generated places 3s wrong in row 1 and shifts inner 4s/3s).
 * In train3, row order and positions are mangled (e.g., generated keeps border-like 4s but misaligns inner 1/2 shapes, swapping some row patterns entirely compared to expected, possibly due to incorrect row start/end).
 * Function `count_nonzeros` is helpful for row density but not used effectively for global bounds.
 * Functions `first_nonzero` and `last_nonzero` are useful per-row tools but underutilized—program takes min/max over a subset of rows only, causing incomplete column spans (e.g., misses rightmost 3s in train1 row 11).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., separate shapes like borders vs. fills) attempted, but may not be needed; simple bounding box suffices if global.
 * Padding works partially (centered zeros added correctly), but since crop is wrong, final output has artifacts like extra internal zeros or shifts (e.g., train2 generated has 3s in row1 where expected has zeros, and misplaces 4s).
 * Train1 mismatches include: row0 generated [0,0,3,0,3,...] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,...3,...] (shifted left, wrong positions); row2 generated has 8s starting too left; row10 generated [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,3,0] (missing right 8, extra left alignment).
 * Train2 mismatches: row1 generated [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0] (3 too left); row3 generated [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5] (extra left 3s, missing right 3s); inner 4s shifted.
 * Train3 mismatches: Entire structure wrong—generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips row patterns (e.g., expected row0 [0,4,0,...] vs generated row1; inner 1/2 blobs misaligned, e.g., row4 generated [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4] with different zero placements).
 * No reordering or flipping attempted, which might be needed for train3's apparent rotation, but likely not—mismatches are from bad cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it excessively pads with zero rows (e.g., rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zero, but content starts at row3 with partial 3s, suggesting over-removal of top rows or wrong row bounds; expected likely crops tighter to rows with 5/3/4 content).
 * Content is somewhat preserved (e.g., central 3s and 4 in rows 4-8 match patterns like train1/2), but columns are shifted left (e.g., row4 [5,5,0,3,3,...] starts 5s too early vs. likely expected border-like spacing), and right side has uneven 5s, missing potential asymmetry.
 * Too many full-zero rows indicate the contiguous block logic failed again (test input has zero rows at top/bottom, but program may have cropped to inner block, excluding framing 5s properly).
 * Inner structure (e.g., 3s forming a shape with 4 inside, 5s as border) is visible but misaligned, e.g., row5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] has 3s not centered; does not match a clean, tight crop—likely needs global min/max to include all 5/3/4 without extra left/right zeros.
 * Overall, it partially captures the "object" but distorts positions, similar to training failures; correct output should be a centered square with exact non-zero placements, no excessive zero borders beyond minimal padding.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to extract the "main content" of a sparse grid (likely an image or diagram represented as numbers) by cropping to a tight bounding box around all non-zero elements and then padding the result to a centered square of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, using zero-padding. The output must exactly match the expected grid structure, including precise positioning of non-zeros after padding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping must capture *all* non-zero elements in the grid without excluding any, even if they are separated by empty (all-zero) rows or columns within the content area—do not assume content is in a single consecutive block.
 * Padding must be centered: for a subgrid of height h and width w, pad to size s = max(h, w), with vertical padding split as evenly as possible (top_pad = (s - h) // 2, bottom_pad = s - h - top_pad) and similarly for horizontal (left/right), ensuring zeros are added symmetrically around the content.
 * The bounding box for rows should be the minimal and maximal row indices containing *any* non-zero (i.e., overall min_r and max_r across the entire grid where sum(row) > 0), not the longest consecutive sequence of non-empty rows, as empty rows inside the content must still be included if they are between min_r and max_r.
 * For columns, the bounding box should similarly be the minimal and maximal column indices with *any* non-zero in the entire grid (or equivalently in the row-bounded subgrid), to avoid shifting or excluding edge content.
 * Grids may have outer empty rows/columns that should be cropped out, but inner empty rows/columns within the bounding box must be preserved as part of the content.
 * Output must be a list of lists (exact 2D structure), with each inner list being a flat row of integers—no formatting errors like mixing list-of-lists with separate lists.
 * Subtleties include handling cases where h != w (asymmetric padding), grids with isolated non-zeros (e.g., borders or sparse elements), and ensuring no artificial shifting occurs during extraction (e.g., due to incorrect min_c/max_c calculation).
 * All training examples failed, suggesting the consecutive-rows approach fragments content; the test output's weird formatting (mixing [] and [[ ]]) indicates a printing or return issue in the program.
 * No evidence of needing to "extract objects" like blobs or connected components—it's purely bounding box + padding, not semantic analysis.
 * Consider overall sparsity: grids have lots of zeros, so sum(row) > 0 is a reliable non-empty check, but verify with any(g[i][j] != 0 for j in row).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current attempt's functions are mostly on the right track for extraction and padding but broken in row selection; here's a refined version of key helpers (unhelpful ones like find_longest_consecutive_nonempty_rows should be discarded):

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_overall_bounding_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the minimal and maximal row indices containing at least one non-zero element (overall bounding, includes inner empties)."""
    n = len(g)
    nonempty_rows = [i for i in range(n) if any(cell != 0 for cell in g[i])]
    if not nonempty_rows:
        return 0, n - 1  # Edge case: all empty, return full grid
    return min(nonempty_rows), max(nonempty_rows)

def find_overall_bounding_columns(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the minimal and maximal column indices containing at least one non-zero in the entire grid."""
    n_rows = len(g)
    if n_rows == 0:
        return 0, 0
    n_cols = len(g[0])
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(n_rows):
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_c = min(min_c, j)
                max_c = max(max_c, j)
    if max_c == -1:
        return 0, n_cols - 1  # All empty
    return min_c, max_c
```

```python
def create_padded_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Extract the subgrid from the given bounds and pad to a square of side max(h, w), centered with zeros."""
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    size = max(h, w)
    top_pad = (size - h) // 2
    bottom_pad = size - h - top_pad
    left_pad = (size - w) // 2
    right_pad = size - w - left_pad
    # Extract subgrid rows
    subgrid = [[g[min_r + i][min_c + j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    # Horizontally pad each row
    padded_rows = [[ [0] * left_pad + subgrid[i] + [0] * right_pad for i in range(h) ]]
    # Vertically pad with zero rows
    output = [[0] * size for _ in range(top_pad)] + padded_rows[0] + [[0] * size for _ in range(bottom_pad)]
    return output
```

The function find_longest_consecutive_nonempty_rows from the attempt is broken/not helpful (it ignores inner empty rows and picks only the longest block, leading to incomplete content; discard it). find_bounding_columns is mostly helpful but should use overall grid, not row-limited. create_padded_subgrid is helpful but has a minor bug in the attempt's version (padded_sub uses list comprehension incorrectly, leading to nested lists; fixed above). No need for object extraction functions, as the puzzle is geometric cropping, not component analysis.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on cropping to the longest consecutive non-empty rows, which worked for identifying a dense block but failed by excluding potential inner empty rows or outer content, resulting in shifted or incomplete grids in all training examples.
 * Padding logic was mostly correct (centered zeros to square), but extraction errors propagated, causing mismatches like extra/missing non-zeros or wrong positions (e.g., in Train 1, generated row 0 has 3's at positions 2 and 4, but expected has them at 3 and 11; unknown why exactly, but likely due to wrong min_c shifting the subgrid left).
 * In Train 1, the generated grid mismatched expected in multiple rows: e.g., row 2 generated [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3] (leading 3's missing, trailing 3 added; row 5 generated [0,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,0,8,8,3,3] vs expected [3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,0,8,8,3,0] (leading zeros instead of 3's); row 9 generated [3,3,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,3,0] vs expected [0,3,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,3,0] (extra 8's and wrong positions).
 * In Train 2, generated mismatched in row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5] (extra 3's, missing trailing 3 and 5 shift); row 4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs expected [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0] (missing 4's, wrong positions for 3's); the generated seems to have cropped too narrowly on columns, excluding right-edge content.
 * In Train 3, generated row 2 [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] (leading 4 misplaced, missing inner 1's); row 5 [0,4,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,4] vs expected [4,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,4,0] (wrong starting elements, shifted 1's and 4's); suggests incorrect row/column bounds, possibly treating border patterns as separate blocks.
 * All attempts (just this one) produced 2D lists correctly sized to square but with content errors; no successful training passes, indicating core row selection flaw.
 * Function find_longest_consecutive_nonempty_rows is incorrect and not relevant (it splits on inner empties, don't use it); find_bounding_columns is partially helpful but row-limited; create_padded_subgrid has nesting bug in horizontal padding.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it has inconsistent formatting (some rows as flat [0,0,...] lists, others as [[0,0,...]] sublists, and stray empty rows like [0,0,...] repeated), suggesting a return or printing bug in the program rather than a clean 2D list.
 * Content appears partially cropped (e.g., middle rows show 3's, 4's, 5's in a pattern, with empty top/bottom), but it's not centered-padded to a proper square—e.g., row with [[5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5]] has 13 elements, but surrounding empties are not symmetrically padded, and the overall structure mixes 1D/2D, making it invalid.
 * It seems to have applied the consecutive-rows logic, capturing a central block but missing precise bounds (e.g., the 3's and 5's look like borders, but positions don't align symmetrically); without expected test output, it's unclear if content matches, but the messiness indicates it won't pass any validation.
 * To handle test case, ensure overall bounding (not consecutive) to capture full border-like patterns, and fix output to always return List[List[int]] without nesting errors.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation, where the goal is to identify the core non-zero content (likely an "image" or object formed by numbers representing colors/shapes) within a larger grid that may include borders, frames, or extraneous zeros, then crop, pad, and center it into a square format while preserving the relative positions and values of the inner elements. The outputs suggest a need to tightly bound the main block, handle irregular shapes without distortion, and ensure precise alignment/padding to match expected layouts, possibly accounting for symmetric frames or multiple components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids contain numbers (e.g., 3 for borders/frames, 6/8/4/5 for inner shapes/objects) separated by zeros; the "main block" is the contiguous or visually central non-zero region, but not necessarily the absolute minimal bounding box if it includes frame elements that should be partially retained or adjusted.
 * Padding must create a square (side length based on max of height/width of the block), with even distribution on all sides, but the current approach over-pads or misaligns, leading to shifted elements (e.g., borders not symmetric).
 * Subtle asymmetries in inner shapes (e.g., 8's and 6's in train 1 forming irregular blobs) must be preserved exactly; the program distorts by slicing incorrectly or assuming uniform rows.
 * Frames (e.g., 3's in train 1/2, 4's/5's in train 2/3) seem integral but need selective inclusion/exclusion—generated outputs include full frames but misplace inner details, suggesting the block should encompass frame + content but center precisely.
 * Handle multiple disconnected components (e.g., train 1 has 6's and 8's not fully contiguous); the longest consecutive row span works partially but fails on column bounding if rows have varying non-zero extents.
 * Zeros inside the block (holes in shapes) must remain; padding adds outer zeros only, but current code adds uneven pads, causing shifts (e.g., train 1 generated top row has 3's too leftward vs. expected).
 * Grid size varies (13x13 in train 1, 10x10 in others); output must match input dimensions or expand to square, but examples show same size with internal rearrangement/padding.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs sometimes swap or reorder rows/columns slightly (e.g., train 1 row 2 expected matches generated row 2, but row 3 has 8's shifted right; train 3 borders are inverted in positions), hinting at possible rotation, mirroring, or canonical orientation.
 * For test input: Central cross-like shape with 3's (horizontal/vertical bars), framed by 5's on sides and bottom; main block spans rows 3-9, columns 0-12, but with sparse 4's—output should center this into square, preserving the 3-bar structure without over-padding edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_main_block(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]:
    """
    Attempts to find bounding box of non-empty rows/columns.
    Works for identifying row span (consecutive non-empty rows) but fails on precise column bounds per row,
    leading to wide/over-inclusive w that causes misalignment.
    """
    # (existing code as provided; partially useful for row detection but needs per-row min/max refinement)
    pass
```

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """

    and row_slice assumes uniform width across h, ignoring varying row lengths).
    Not sufficient alone—needs better bounding and possible row/column reordering.
    """
    # (existing code as provided; core idea is right but implementation distorts shapes)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies a vertical span of non-empty rows (e.g., train 1 uses rows 2-11, close to expected) and computes a square side s = max(h, w), which works for sizing.
 * What worked: Padding adds zeros correctly in concept, and output remains same dimensions; handles empty grids edge case.
 * What didn't: Bounding box is too loose on columns (uses global min/max_cs across rows, but rows have varying extents, leading to extra zeros sliced in, e.g., train 1 generated row 3 has 8's starting too early vs. expected shifted right).
 * Train 1: Generated includes full 3-frame but shifts inner 8/6 shapes left/up (e.g., row 3 generated [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs. expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...]—3's protrude incorrectly, and bottom rows mismatch in 8 placements, possibly due to uneven pad_w=1 or wrong min_c=1).
 * Train 2: Generated border 5's/3's misaligned (e.g., row 4 generated [5,0,3,0,4,...] vs. expected [5,3,3,0,4,...]—inner 3's and 4's shifted, missing right-side 3's; seems to crop too narrowly on columns).
 * Train 3: Generated inverts border pattern (starts with [4,0,4,...] on row 0 vs. expected [0,4,0,...]), and inner 1/2 shapes are distorted (e.g., row 5 generated [0,4,1,0,2,...] vs. expected [4,0,0,0,2,...]—rows appear swapped or columns offset by 1).
 * Overall: Program assumes rectangular uniform slice, but shapes are irregular; no handling for frame detection or orientation—leads to all INCORRECT.
 * find_main_block is partially helpful for row spans but broken for columns (min/max_cs aggregates wrongly, inflating w); use but refine with per-row trimming.
 * No other functions tried; this attempt shows basic understanding of cropping/padding but misses shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output pads the entire grid to 13x13 (all zeros except inner), centering a block around rows 4-8 with 3's and 5's/4's, but it looks incorrect: it retains full-width 5's on sides but squishes the central 3-bar structure (e.g., row 5 generated [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] vs. what should be a tighter centered cross preserving sparse 4's and gaps—expected likely has more even padding, no side 5's bleeding into center, and 4's unshifted).
 * Differences: Over-pads top/bottom with 3 empty rows each (reasonable for square but misaligns if s computed wrong); inner 3's form a plus-sign but generated row 6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] keeps side 5's too wide, distorting the frame—expected should crop 5's as borders and center only the 3/4 core, possibly rotating to match train patterns.
 * Does not make sense: The output treats 5's as part of main block (w too wide), leading to asymmetric padding; subtle 4's (single cell?) are preserved but offset, hinting program misses isolated elements—likely needs component detection, not just bounding box.
 * To handle test: Refine column bounds to tightest per row, exclude outer frames if they are uniform (e.g., detect 5's as border), and ensure s pads minimally while keeping shape intact.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop a grid to focus on the "main" or central non-zero content (likely a symbol, digit, or pattern formed by numbers like 3, 5, 6, 8 representing filled pixels or segments), then pad it symmetrically with zeros to form a square grid of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, while preserving the relative positions and ensuring alignment matches the expected output. The process involves identifying contiguous rows with significant non-zero activity, computing tight column bounds within those rows, cropping, and centering via padding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping must use the tightest bounding box around the main object, but only for contiguous rows that form the core pattern—do not include isolated border rows or rows with minimal/sparse non-zeros if they are not part of the contiguous block, as this can shift the content left/right or include/exclude elements incorrectly.
 * Padding must be centered (even distribution on top/bottom and left/right), but the side length is the max of cropped height/width; however, if the input is already square-like, avoid over-padding or shifting the content asymmetrically.
 * Subtle element: The "main" row for starting the crop is the one with the highest non-zero count, but the contiguous block must extend only to rows where counts >0 without skipping zeros inside the object (but zeros inside are okay if part of the pattern); overlooking internal zero rows within the object can truncate it.
 * Grids may have border-like zeros or sparse rows (e.g., single non-zeros) that should be excluded from the crop to avoid including "frames" or artifacts, but the expected outputs sometimes retain specific sparse elements if they are integral to the pattern's edges.
 * Column bounds must be computed per the selected row range, but min/max columns should ignore empty rows within the range—easy to miss if bounds include padding from empty sub-rows.
 * Patterns involve numbers (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6/4/5 for fills), so treat all non-zero as "filled" for counting/bounds, but preserve exact values in output.
 * Inputs are rectangular lists of lists, outputs must be square and exactly match expected row-by-row, including zero placements.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return [[0]]; sparse patterns may require manual adjustment if auto-contiguous misses disconnected but related parts (though examples suggest patterns are contiguous).
 * From attempts: Row extension (start/end) works for dense centers but fails if the max-count row is not perfectly centered in the object, leading to asymmetric crops; padding functions are correct but applied after wrong crop, causing shifts.

```
These are helpful for identifying the core row range based on non-zero density.

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)

        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
These are useful for per-row and aggregate bounds, and basic cropping; they correctly compute min/max but fail if row range is wrong.

    size = len(cropped[0])
    for _ in range(row_pad_top):
        cropped.insert(0, [0] * size)
    for _ in range(row_pad_bottom):
        cropped.append([0] * size)
    return cropped
```
These handle symmetric padding well and are not broken—use them after fixing crop.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the max non-zero row and extends to contiguous non-zero rows, which works for dense central patterns but fails when the object has internal zero-count rows or when sparse edge rows (e.g., borders) should be excluded, leading to over-inclusion of empty space.
 * Cropping via row/column bounds is mostly right but computes min/max too broadly within the row range, including outliers from sparse rows, causing left-shifted content (e.g., in Train 1, generated row 0 has 3's at positions 2 and 4, but expected at 3 and 10, indicating wrong column start).
 * Padding to square is correct in logic (centered, max(h,w) side), but since crop is wrong, the final grid has shifted/misaligned patterns—e.g., Train 1 generated includes extra left zeros and wrong placements in rows 2-10 compared to expected (e.g., generated row 2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...], missing leading zeros and altering 3/8 positions).
 * Train 2 mismatches in row 1 (generated [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0], wrong 3 position) and row 3 (generated [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], extra 3's and shifted), suggesting column bounds grabbed too wide or wrong row range excluded top sparse rows.
 * Train 3 mismatches entirely in row ordering and content—generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips even/odd rows ([0,4,0,...] first), indicating the contiguous row finder or crop ignored the alternating border pattern, treating it as non-contiguous or wrong start row.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond bounds; a function to detect connected components (e.g., flood-fill for blobs) might help if patterns have disconnected parts, but current attempt lacks this—consider adding for future if contiguity fails.
 * The overall program(g) handles empty cases well but defaults to full grid crop if bounds fail, which over-pads without centering the true object.
 * Function `program` integrates everything but is broken due to row range logic—don't reuse without fixing start/end finders to skip zero-count rows outside the main block.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to crop/pad the entire input grid (13x13) with minimal trimming, resulting in large zero borders (e.g., rows 0-2 and 9-12 all zeros, content squeezed in rows 3-8 but shifted right with uneven columns, like 5's at edges but 3/4 patterns not centered). 
 * Compared to mentally running rules: The test input has a central cross-like pattern with 5's on sides, 3's in middle rows/columns, and a 4 in row 6 col 6; correct output should crop tightly to rows ~3-8 (height 6), columns ~3-9 (width 7, side=7), pad to 7x7 centered (e.g., add 0.5 rows top/bottom, 0 left/1 right), preserving exact 3/4/5 positions without the full 13x13 bloat or left/right shifts seen in generated (e.g., generated row 4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] includes outer 5's but expected would trim them if borders, centering the inner 3's and single 4).
 * It makes sense as a failed full-grid pad but not as correct extraction—missing tight crop leads to oversized zeros, and content alignment (e.g., 5's too far left in generated row 4) doesn't match a centered pattern; unknown why it didn't trim columns better, but likely because col_bounds took min_c=0 from edge 5's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely pixel art or ASCII-like representations with numbers as colors/values) where the goal is to extract or crop the "main object" or central content from a larger grid that includes borders, frames, or extraneous zero-padded areas. The extraction should produce a subgrid that matches the expected "clean" or bounded version of the object, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while trimming surrounding zeros appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid always has fixed dimensions (e.g., 20 columns in example 1, 10 in others), but the main object does not span the full width or height; borders often consist of patterned zeros or repeating non-zeros (e.g., 3's or 5's forming frames).
 * Non-zero rows are not always fully consecutive; there may be isolated zero rows at the top/bottom that should be excluded, but the "longest block" approach misses cases where the object has internal zero rows or irregular shapes.
 * Column cropping must account for the tightest bounding box per row group, but min/max columns are calculated per row in the block—subtleties include asymmetric objects where left/right edges vary, and zeros within the object should be preserved (not trimmed internally).
 * Objects may have "legs" or extensions (e.g., in example 1, the bottom row has sparse 3's that differ in generated vs. expected), requiring per-row min/max rather than global for the block.
 * All examples show symmetric or framed structures (e.g., 5's as borders in example 2, 4's in example 3), so extraction should ignore outer frames and focus on inner content; however, frames may integrate with the object (e.g., 3's in example 1 seem part of the object).
 * Expected outputs preserve some leading/trailing zeros within rows to maintain shape (e.g., example 1 expected has [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] vs. generated [0,0,3,0,3,...]), indicating no global left-trimming—crop to the union of all non-zero positions across the relevant rows.
 * Subtle element: The "object" may span nearly all rows but exclude thin top/bottom zero rows; in example 3, the object is rotated or checkerboard-patterned, and extraction flips or reorders rows/columns incorrectly.
 * Consider connectivity: Non-zeros may form disconnected blobs, but examples suggest extracting the primary connected component (e.g., ignore small isolated elements).
 * Height of extracted grid varies (13 rows in example 1, 10 in others), so dynamically determine start/end rows based on first/last non-all-zero rows, not just longest block.
 * Numbers represent colors/types (e.g., 3=one type, 8=another), so preserve exact values; zeros are background.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a longest consecutive non-zero row block to determine height, which worked partially for examples 1 and 2 (captured most rows) but failed in example 3 by including extra patterned rows (e.g., generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected starts with [0,4,0,...], indicating wrong row order or selection).
 * Global min/max column calculation worked for rough width in example 1 (13 cols output) but produced incorrect content: e.g., train 1 generated first row [0,0,3,0,3,0,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...], missing a leading zero and including an extra 3 early—likely due to min_c=1 instead of 3, shifting the slice left.
 * In train 2, generated included extraneous elements like [0,3,3,0,4,...] in row 4 vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], showing the uniform slice didn't align with the inner object's varying left edges (e.g., expected has more leading zeros in some rows).
 * Train 3 generated a near-full grid but mismatched row order and content: e.g., first row [4,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,...], and internal rows like generated [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—suggests the block finder took wrong start/end, and column slicing ignored the checkerboard symmetry.
 * The has_non_zero function is solid and essential for row detection.
 * find_longest_block is partially helpful but broken for gapped or framed objects (e.g., misses that example 3 has alternating non-zero rows throughout).
 * find_min_col and find_max_col are flawed—not helpful as-is, since they compute global bounds but objects need per-row trimming or union bounds that preserve internal spacing; using them leads to shifted or squished outputs.
 * Overall program demonstrates basic bounding box understanding but ignores frame detection and per-row variation, causing all mismatches; no object extraction beyond crude cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same flawed longest-block + global min/max column slicing, producing 7 rows of width 13, but the content shows irregular 5's and 3's that seem like a partial frame or object (e.g., first row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,...] suggests top border, but middle rows like [5,5,0,3,3,3,...] include outer 5's that may be frame elements to exclude).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: e.g., symmetric 5-borders in rows 2,4,6 suggest the output included frame instead of cropping to inner 3/4 content; the sparse bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,...] looks like it trimmed too much vertically, missing potential object extensions.
 * The output has varying non-zero positions (e.g., 3's clustered in cols 5-9, 5's on edges), indicating the global slice shifted everything left (min_c too low), distorting the shape—likely incorrect as it doesn't preserve the "clean" inner object seen in training expecteds.
 * No way to confirm exact expected without rules, but it fails to handle frame-like 5's (similar to train 2's borders), so probably needs frame detection or better row selection to exclude top/bottom zeros properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving sparse grids of integers (likely representing colored cells or patterns), where the goal is to extract a cropped subgrid that captures the "main" figure or object while removing extraneous empty (zero) borders or padding, resulting in a tighter, possibly rectangular bounding area around the non-zero content. The extraction should preserve the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but trim outer empty rows/columns to focus on the core pattern, without forcing a square shape or including unnecessary whitespace.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids are often large (e.g., 18x18 or 19x19) with significant empty (zero) areas on the borders, especially left/right columns and top/bottom rows; the output must crop these dynamically to the minimal or near-minimal bounding rectangle enclosing all non-zero cells, but not so aggressively that internal zeros (part of the pattern) are removed.
 * Outputs are rectangular, not necessarily square—e.g., training example 1 expects 13x13 but with irregular non-zero distribution; forcing square shapes (as in the current program) leads to oversized or misaligned extractions that include padding.
 * Non-zero cells form connected or semi-connected "objects" (e.g., borders, shapes like 3's, 8's, 6's in train1; 5's, 3's, 4's in train2; 4's and inner patterns in train3), and the extraction should encompass the largest or primary object without fragmenting it or including disconnected outliers.
 * Internal zeros within the pattern must be preserved (e.g., gaps in shapes), but outer pure-zero rows/columns should be trimmed; subtle elements include asymmetric padding (more empty on left in train1) and potential for multiple disjoint objects (e.g., small isolated cells in test input like bottom-right 5's).
 * The puzzle may involve identifying a "frame" or border (e.g., alternating 4's in train3) as part of the core pattern, so cropping shouldn't remove structural edges unless they are fully empty.
 * Grids can have varying sizes, so the program must compute bounds dynamically rather than hardcoding; consider row/column spans of non-zeros, but account for cases where the "main" object doesn't span the full height/width (e.g., train2 has empty middle rows in output? No, output includes them if part of bounds).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs can have leading/trailing zeros in rows if they are part of the pattern's edge (e.g., train1 row1 starts/ends with zeros), but entire rows/columns of zeros on the perimeter should be omitted; also, rotation or reordering (seen in train3 mismatch) isn't needed—extraction is positional cropping.
 * Across attempts (only one shown, but implied iterations): Prioritize bounding box over density; handle varying grid sizes without assuming square; avoid maximizing non-zeros in a square, as it grabs too-wide areas with padding (e.g., train1 includes 5+ left zeros per row).

    return [[g[i][j] for j in range(start_col, end_col)] for i in range(start_row, end_row)]
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `find_largest_square_block`: Broken for this puzzle—forces square (w == h) and maximizes non-zero count within it, leading to padded or oversized extractions (e.g., grabs full-width with left zeros in train1); ignores rectangular bounds and includes empty rows/columns; not relevant, as puzzle outputs aren't strictly square.
 * Current `program`: Relies on square finder, so always fails on asymmetric patterns; extracts too much padding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown uses a square-focused approach, which worked partially by identifying dense non-zero areas (e.g., captured most of the 3/8/6 patterns in train1) but failed by including excessive left/top/bottom padding zeros, resulting in oversized/wider outputs (18 cols vs. expected 13 in train1; 15 vs. 10 in train2).
 * Train1: Generated a near-full grid with 5+ leading zeros per row and extra bottom empty rows, mismatching expected cropped version (starts trimming at col 3, ends at col 15-ish, removes left empty block); unknown why it picked h=11 starting at row 0, but it over-included empties; nz maximization grabbed too-wide span (min_c=6, w=11? but still padded).
 * Train2: Generated included extra left/right empties and mismatched row lengths (15 vs. 10), capturing 5/3/4 patterns but with padding (e.g., leading zeros in rows); failed to crop tightly around the central object, adding irrelevant empty rows at bottom.
 * Train3: Generated almost the full 10x10 but with rows 1-2 swapped and inner pattern misaligned (e.g., row3 has [4,0,0,0,0,1,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,...]), suggesting wrong start/min_col (perhaps picked h=10, s=0, min_c=0 including border but shifting?); close in size but positionally wrong, missing subtle inner crop.
 * extract_subgrid is mostly helpful but limited to square (h-wide); get_nonzero_cols_per_row is essential for span detection but underused (only for min/max col, not full bounds).
 * Overall: Missed rectangular cropping; considered density over bounds; no handling for asymmetric empties; train samples all failed due to padding inclusion; function forcing square is incorrect (don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it extracts a very wide (19 cols?) rectangular strip starting from the left, including massive empty padding (e.g., rows 1-5 have 3-18 leading zeros before any non-zero like 5 or 3), and captures disjoint elements (top-left 3's, mid-right 5's block, bottom 3/4/5 patterns) without tight cropping, resulting in a sparse, non-focused grid that doesn't isolate a "main" figure.
 * It mismatches what a correct output should be: mentally, the test input has a small top-left 3/5 cluster (rows 0-4, cols 0-3), a mid-right 5's block (rows 6-8, cols 11-14), a large bottom-center 3/4/5 object (rows 10-14, cols 6-17), and scattered bottom 5's (rows 17-18); a correct extraction likely needs to bound the largest/dominant object (bottom 3/4/5, ~5x12), cropping to ~ rows 10-15, cols 6-18, yielding a tighter 6x13 with preserved internals, not the full padded mess; current output includes irrelevant top empties and doesn't focus, making it look like a raw dump rather than a puzzle solution.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with different "colors" or values like 3,6,8) to extract the central or main non-zero content, crop it to a tight bounding box, and pad it symmetrically to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main block" should be identified as the longest consecutive sequence of rows with any non-zero elements, but care must be taken to exclude leading/trailing fully zero rows without including isolated zero rows within the block if they are structurally important (e.g., in example 1, internal zero positions are preserved but the block start/end must align precisely with the expected cropped area).
 * Column bounds must be computed only over the main row block, finding the minimal and maximal non-zero columns across those rows, but without expanding beyond the actual content—subtly, if a row in the block has no non-zeros (but is included in the block due to adjacency), its bounds should not affect min/max (current compute_col_bounds skips if l==-1, which is good, but may still misalign if block includes empty rows incorrectly).
 * Padding to square must be symmetric (centering the content) using zeros, first padding columns to match height, then rows to match the new width, but the target size is max(h,w) after cropping—issue is that if cropping misses parts, padding adds extra zeros in wrong places (e.g., in example 1, generated adds unintended non-zeros or shifts content left/right).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes with borders of zeros; the output should be square but retain the exact relative positions of non-zeros from the cropped area (e.g., example 2 shows misalignment in rows 3-4 where generated has [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] but expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], indicating column crop is too narrow or shifted).
 * Subtle element: Non-zeros represent "pixels" of different types (e.g., 3 might be borders, 6/8 fills), and the puzzle likely requires exact reproduction without altering values or introducing new ones—easy to miss that bounding box must be inclusive of all edge non-zeros but exclusive of outer empty space.
 * In example 3, the pattern alternates rows/columns, and generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips the starting row order, suggesting possible row reversal or reordering not handled (or wrong block detection includes extra).
 * General: Handle empty or all-zero grids by returning [[0]]; assume rectangular input; outputs are lists of lists, printed as rows.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), consider that main block detection uses row non-zero counts correctly but may over-include if zero rows are adjacent (e.g., example 1 generated includes row 0 with partial non-zeros? Wait, generated row 0 [0,0,3,0,3,...] suggests crop started too early or wrong min_c).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(x != 0 for x in row)
```
(This is useful for identifying dense rows.)

```python
def get_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing row densities to find blocks.)

```python
def find_main_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_len = 0
    best_start = 0
    curr_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            len_block = i - curr_start
            if len_block > max_len:
                max_len = len_block
                best_start = curr_start
            curr_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_len - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This identifies the longest run of non-empty rows, which is core but subtly fails if multiple blocks exist or if zeros inside should be included—worked partially for block length but wrong start in examples.)

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row min/max non-zero columns; essential for tight cropping, but only applied to main block rows.)

```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, num_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = num_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l != -1:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
(Combines row bounds for overall column crop; helpful but may yield empty if all rows in block are zero, leading to [[0]] fallback.)

```python
def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row_slice = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row_slice)
    return cropped
```
(Core cropping function; works for slicing but inherits errors from bounds.)

```python
def pad_dimension(lst: List[List[int]], target_size: int, is_rows: bool) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not lst:
        return [[0]]
    current_size = len(lst) if is_rows else len(lst[0])
    if current_size >= target_size:
        return lst
    pad_size = target_size - current_size
    left_or_top = pad_size // 2
    right_or_bottom = pad_size - left_or_top
    if is_rows:
        empty = [0] * len(lst[0])
        for _ in range(left_or_top):
            lst.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(right_or_bottom):
            lst.append(empty[:])
    else:
        for r in range(len(lst)):
            lst[r] = [0] * left_or_top + lst[r] + [0] * right_or_bottom
    return lst
```
(Handles symmetric zero-padding for dimensions; useful and correct in isolation, but applied after faulty crop leads to misaligned content.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    size = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, False)  # pad columns
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, True)   # pad rows
    return cropped
```
(Overall squaring logic; helpful but order matters—padding columns first then rows ensures square, but if w > h initially, row padding adds to height correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the concept of finding a main non-zero block via row counts and cropping to bounding box, which works for isolating content in dense grids but fails on precise start/end (e.g., Train 1 generated starts crop too early, including extraneous left-shifted 3's in row 0 and mismatches like row 2 [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—shifted right by 1 and wrong values at ends; unknown why exact mismatch but likely min_c off by 1).
 * Train 2: Cropping works for row block but column bounds too narrow, omitting right-side elements (generated row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—missing two 3's on right, extra 3 on left); padding adds zeros incorrectly around incomplete crop.
 * Train 3: Block detection includes wrong rows, leading to row order flip or extra borders (generated row 0 [4,0,4,...] vs expected row 0 [0,4,0,...]—seems like it cropped starting from an offset row and didn't reverse or adjust for alternating pattern).
 * find_main_block is helpful but broken for cases with internal zero rows that should be included (it skips on any zero count row, potentially splitting blocks—e.g., if a structural zero row has count=0 but is part of the object, it's excluded).
 * get_row_bounds and compute_col_bounds are essential and mostly correct but fail when block has varying widths, leading to over-tight crops.
 * pad_dimension and pad_to_square are not broken and helpful for final output, but unhelpful if upstream crop is wrong (don't modify, but ensure crop inputs are accurate).
 * Overall, no extraction of "objects" like connected components was attempted, which might be needed if multiple disjoint parts exist (not in this code, but could be relevant for subtleties like ignoring outliers); current approach assumes single main block.
 * Train 1 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., generated row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—extra 3 and wrong positions, likely from faulty end_r or max_c).
 * No function for connected component analysis or object extraction, which might be unhelpful here since the puzzle seems bounding-box based, not segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped a central 5x13-ish pattern (rows ~3-9 with 3's,5's,4's) but padded excessively to 13x13 with large zero borders, shifting the content downward and not centering it properly (e.g., non-zeros start at row 3, but expected likely tighter crop to rows 4-8, columns ~3-10, padded to ~7x7 square embedded in zeros without the wide empty top/bottom). 
 * It includes symmetric 5's on left/right but mismatches internal structure (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] suggests incomplete column crop, missing connections like the 4 in row 6); this doesn't make sense as a clean extraction—likely wrong min_c/max_c (too wide on sides, too narrow vertically) and over-pads without preserving the "object" shape (e.g., the cross-like 3's and inner 4 seem distorted). 
 * To handle test case, account for multiple horizontal bars (top/bottom 5's, middle 3's) by ensuring block includes all connected non-zeros vertically, even if sparse; current code probably picks a partial block, leading to missing top/bottom elements.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid processing, where the goal is to identify the primary "object" or contiguous region of non-zero values in a 2D grid (likely representing an image or shape), crop it to its tight bounding box, and then pad the result to form a square grid while preserving the content. The output should be a transformed grid that isolates and normalizes the main feature for comparison or rendering.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of rows of integers (0 for empty/background, non-zero for filled/object pixels), and the "object" is defined by contiguous sequences of rows with non-zero counts, ignoring isolated or sparse rows.
 * Focus on the largest contiguous block of rows with any non-zeros to avoid including noise or separate components; subtle elements include handling rows with varying non-zero positions (e.g., irregular shapes) and ensuring column bounds are computed only over the selected rows.
 * Cropping must create a tight bounding box: min/max columns based on the first/last non-zero in each relevant row, but aggregated globally to avoid over-cropping jagged edges.
 * Padding to square should center the content (symmetric or near-symmetric padding with zeros) and handle cases where height and width differ, potentially starting from a 1x1 zero grid if empty.
 * Edge cases: empty grids, all-zero rows/columns, single-row/column objects, or grids where non-zeros don't align perfectly; avoid assuming uniform row lengths or non-negative values.
 * Non-zero values might represent different "colors" or intensities, but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding/cropping; preserve original values in the output.
 * Subtlety: Contiguous blocks reset on zero-count rows, so multiple objects might exist, but only the largest is selected—easy to miss if code doesn't properly scan for max length.
 * Global bounds must initialize correctly (e.g., min_col to infinity or grid width, max_col to -1) to handle rows with no non-zeros within the block.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is solid for row density; use it to identify active rows.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing; efficiently computes non-zero counts per row.)

```python
def find_largest_contiguous_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_length = 0
    best_start = 0
    current_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            length = i - current_start
            if length > max_length:
                max_length = length
                best_start = current_start
            current_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_length - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This correctly identifies the start/end of the largest run of non-zero-count rows; essential for isolating the main object vertically. Handles edge cases like all-zero grid returning (0,-1) or similar.)

```python
def get_row_first_last(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n  # Initialize to full width (beyond any valid index)
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row horizontal bounds; note initialization of first to n and last to -1 to handle all-zero rows gracefully, where (n, -1) indicates empty.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
(Reliable for extracting subgrid; assumes valid indices and handles empty slices.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    size = max(h, w)
    # Pad columns first if needed
    if w < size:
        pad_left = (size - w) // 2
        pad_right = size - w - pad_left
        for i in range(h):
            grid[i] = [0] * pad_left + grid[i] + [0] * pad_right
        w = size
    # Pad rows if needed
    if h < size:
        pad_top = (size - h) // 2
        pad_bottom = size - h - pad_top
        empty = [0] * size
        for _ in range(pad_top):
            grid.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(pad_bottom):
            grid.append(empty[:])
    return grid
```
(Effective for centering and squaring; handles empty grids and asymmetric padding well, preserving original values.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt demonstrates partial understanding of the puzzle by correctly identifying the need for contiguous row selection, per-row bounds, tight cropping, and square padding, but fails entirely due to a runtime error in all cases.
 * What worked: The vertical block detection (find_largest_contiguous_block) and per-row bounds (get_row_first_last) are logically sound and would isolate the main object if integrated properly; cropping and padding functions execute without issues in isolation.
 * What didn't work: The compute_global_bounds function is broken—it incorrectly initializes min_c as len(bounds[0][0]), where bounds[0][0] is an int (column index), causing "object of type 'int' has no len()" error on all inputs; this prevents any successful execution, so no outputs are generated for analysis.
 * No training examples or test passed; all resulted in the same execution error, indicating the bug blocks the entire pipeline.
 * The approach assumes the largest contiguous non-zero row block is the "object," which aligns with puzzle subtleties (e.g., ignoring noise), but untested due to crash.
 * Function compute_global_bounds is broken and unhelpful in its current form (causes crash; don't use without fixing initialization to something like min_c = float('inf') or grid width, and max_c = -1, then update only if l != -1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to the len() on int bug, so no actual grid is generated—completely incorrect and unusable for verification.
 * Expected test output should be a square-padded bounding box of the main contiguous object (e.g., if test input has a central shape spanning rows 2-5 and columns 3-7, output would crop to that 4x5 region, pad to 5x5 with zeros around, preserving non-zeros); the error prevents any match, and without seeing the input grid, it's unclear if the approach would otherwise align, but the crash confirms it does not produce a valid result.
 * This highlights the need to handle empty or edge rows in bounds aggregation without assuming non-empty tuples.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns (likely representing shapes, figures, or "objects" with pixel values like 3,5,6,8,4 indicating colors or types), where the goal is to extract the "main" or primary figure/object from the input grid, normalize its position (e.g., translate to top-left), compute a bounding box, and output a square grid representation padded with zeros, while ignoring or excluding noise, frames, or secondary elements. The output size is based on the max dimension of the extracted region, but the results suggest the extraction criteria (e.g., row selection, bounding box) are imprecise, leading to inclusions/exclusions of pixels that don't match expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain a "main" figure (dense cluster of non-zero pixels) surrounded by potential noise, frames, or disconnected elements (e.g., sparse lines or dots outside the core shape); the program must identify and isolate only the primary connected or consecutive component, excluding outer frames or isolated pixels.
 * Y-range selection is critical: use consecutive rows with non-zero sums, but prioritize the block with maximum total non-zero pixels to avoid noise; however, subtle disconnected parts (e.g., small protrusions or separate blobs) may need inclusion if part of the main structure, or exclusion if they are artifacts.
 * Bounding box computation must tightly fit the main figure's extent (min/max x/y of non-zeros in selected rows), but avoid expanding to include frame-like borders; translation shifts to (0,0) origin, and output is a square of side max(width, height) of the bbox, padded with zeros—do not return the original n x n size unless s == n.
 * Subtleties include handling asymmetric shapes (e.g., figures not centered), multiple potential "main" blocks (select largest by sum or area), and ensuring no pixel values are altered during extraction/translation—only positions change.
 * Noise handling: Grids may have zero-rows or sparse rows above/below/around the main figure; do not include them in the y-range or bbox unless they connect to the main structure.
 * Output must preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within the extracted region; mismatches often occur in top/bottom rows (e.g., extra 3s included as noise) or side alignments (e.g., shifted 8s or 6s).
 * Consider connected components: The main figure may not be fully rectangular; use row_bounds to find per-row min/max x, but aggregate carefully to avoid over-expansion.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return zero-filled n x n; if no main block, output zeros; varying grid sizes (10x10 or 13x13) mean s can be < n, leading to smaller outputs implicitly padded in display.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect y-range (including noise rows) or bbox (missing/extruding parts), resulting in shifted or incomplete figures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several modular functions for row analysis and extraction, which are partially useful for identifying and isolating regions but need refinement for accurate main figure selection (e.g., better y-range logic or component detection). No new types are defined, but Tuple[int, int] for bounds and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for pixels (y,x,value) are effective for handling positions and values.

The main `program` function composes these but is flawed in y-range/bbox selection; no explicit object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) is present, which might be needed for complex shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (all training examples failed); it correctly implements modular extraction/translation/padding but fails on core selection logic.
 * What worked: Pixel extraction preserves values; translation to (0,0) normalizes position; square padding handles varying bbox sizes; row_sums and row_bounds efficiently identify dense regions without full scans.
 * What didn't work: Y-range selection via max-sum consecutive rows includes noise (e.g., top/bottom sparse rows with 3s in train1), leading to bbox that captures extras; no handling for disconnected components or frames, causing over-inclusion; output size s often matches n but with misplaced pixels due to wrong min_y/max_y.
 * Train1: Generated includes extra 3s in row0 (positions 2,4) and row12 (3s at 3,4), but expected has 3s at 3 and 10 in row0, and 3s at 5 and 7 in row12; inner figure (8s,6s) is shifted/missing parts (e.g., generated row2 has 8s at 2-3 but expected at 3; row10 has 8s at 8-9 but expected at 9 missing); overall, figure is vertically expanded with noise, horizontally misaligned (unknown reason, possibly bbox min_x too low).
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 at 3 but expected all 0s except row1 3 at 6; row3 has 3s at 1-2 but expected 3 at 2; row4 has 5 at 0,3 at 2 but expected 5 at 0,3s at 1-2; row5 matches somewhat but row6 has 4s missing in expected positions; figure is incomplete/shifted rightward, with extra 3s in noise rows (e.g., row1), suggesting wrong y-range including top noise.
 * Train3: Generated row0/1 are [4,0,4,...]/[0,4,0,...] but expected swapped to [0,4,0,...]/[4,0,4,...], indicating possible rotation or frame misextraction; inner 1s/2s are misplaced (e.g., generated row2 has 1 at 5 but expected row2 all 0s except 1s at 3-4; row4 has 2s at 4-5 but expected row4 2s at 4-5 ok, but surrounding 1s wrong); frame is included but inverted, inner figure vertically shifted down by ~1 row (unknown reason, likely y-range starts too early).
 * Function `get_main_bbox` is helpful but broken when y-range is noisy (propagates errors); `find_main_y_range` is essential but insufficient (needs connectivity or size threshold); no unhelpful functions, but the composition in `program` assumes single main block—add component detection for multi-blob grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of normalization but misses subtle noise exclusion and precise component isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it extracts a partial figure (5s on sides, 3s/4s in middle) but places it starting from row1 (with row0 as [0s,3,3,0s] like noise or bottom fragment), repeats the pattern in rows1-2/4-5 but inverts or shifts (e.g., row2 has 3s at 4-8 but test input row? has different), adds isolated 3 in row6 middle, then pads with 7+ zero rows— this suggests wrong y-range (included top noise, excluded bottom?), incomplete bbox (missing left/right alignments, e.g., 5s at 0-1 and 11-12 but 3s not centered), and over-padding without centering. Expected likely a tight square of the central cross-like figure (3s horizontal, 4s vertical-ish, framed by 5s) translated to top-left without extras, possibly 7x7 or similar s<13, but output bloats to 13x13 with misplaced elements (e.g., duplicated rows 1/5 and 2/4 indicate loop error or wrong min_y). It fails to isolate the main "plus" shape, including apparent noise 3s, and doesn't match a clean normalized output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:32:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of numbers (likely representing pixel-like patterns or objects with different values like 3,5,8,4,6,1,2 indicating colors, shapes, or densities), where the goal is to automatically detect, extract, and isolate the "main" or central patterned object(s) by cropping to their bounding box and padding to a square grid, while removing extraneous empty space, noise, or secondary elements. The output must match the expected clean, centered square representations exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements within the object.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids contain multiple potential "objects" or patterns (e.g., scattered numbers like 3's forming borders, 8's in shapes, 5's in lines), but only the primary cohesive one(s) should be extracted—secondary or isolated elements (e.g., lone 8's at the bottom in training example 1, or small 3's/4's in example 2) must be omitted to avoid bloating the output.
 * Extraction involves identifying a contiguous block of rows and columns that tightly bounds the main object, not just the densest rows via sum of non-zeros; subtle connections (e.g., via adjacent non-zeros) or visual coherence (e.g., forming a recognizable shape like a figure or symbol) should guide selection, as pure density (Kadane's) misses vertically sparse but connected parts.
 * Padding must center the cropped object in a square of size equal to the max dimension of the crop, using zeros; however, over-padding or including empty rows/columns leads to mismatched sizes (e.g., generated outputs often have 19x19 with excessive zeros, while expected are smaller like 13x13 or 10x10).
 * Non-zero values must be preserved exactly (no alteration), and the output grid must be rectangular lists of lists, but represented as square after padding; subtle elements include handling irregular shapes where first/last non-zero columns vary per row, requiring global min/max bounds per block, but avoiding blocks that include disconnected noise.
 * Grids may have varying sizes (e.g., 19x19 in example 1, 17x17 in example 2), with empty borders or padding already present; extraction should ignore outer zeros but detect if the main object spans most of the grid or is offset.
 * Connected components (e.g., 4-connected or 8-connected non-zeros) might be key to identify "objects" rather than row sums, as current method grabs loose contiguous rows including gaps.
 * Edge cases: All-zero grids return [[0]]; single-object grids need tight crop; multiple objects require selecting the largest/coherent one (e.g., in example 3, ignore top scattered 1's and 4's, focus on central patterned block).
 * Outputs are shown as flattened rows but are 2D lists; mismatches often in size (too big) or content (extra zeros/noise included).

Not relevant—replace with connected component detection or manual block search.)"""
    # ... (code as provided, but flawed logic for if counts[i] > max_current + counts[i], which is always true if counts[i] > 0; buggy comparison)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by selecting overly broad row blocks via flawed Kadane's on row non-zero sums, leading to inclusion of empty or sparse rows (e.g., in training 1, generated a 19x19 with bottom empty rows and side zeros, while expected is 13x13 tight crop of central 3/8/6 pattern; difference: extra padding and missed tight row 2-12 crop, omitting bottom 8's correctly but bloating size).
 * In training 2, generated scattered 5/3/4 elements across a large zero-padded grid, including isolated top/bottom parts, while expected is 10x10 tight extraction of central 5/3/4 shape; difference: wrong row selection (e.g., included row 2 with single 5, but expected starts from denser block), resulting in disconnected output.
 * In training 3, generated a mess with top scattered 1's/4's and bottom empty, missing the central 4/1/2 pattern; expected 10x10 vertical crop/pad of rows ~10-18; difference: selected wrong block (rows 2-3 and 9-18 loosely), ignoring main object's vertical span.
 * Cropping and padding functions worked technically (produced square outputs), but fed bad inputs, so outputs mismatched in content (extra zeros, wrong elements) and size.
 * No connected component analysis, so missed subtle object cohesion (e.g., 8-connected non-zeros for shapes); density sum overlooked vertical/horizontal sparsity in main objects.
 * Bug in Kadane's: The condition `if counts[i] > max_current + counts[i]` simplifies to `0 > max_current`, which is rarely true, causing incorrect start/end indices (e.g., often picks single high-density rows or full grid).
 * extract_objects not present, but would be essential—current approach lacks object detection, treating rows independently.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a large ~19x19 grid with scattered 5's, 3's, and 4's in disconnected patches (e.g., isolated 5's in rows 1-5 and 7-8, then a partial 3/4/5 shape in rows 11-15, plus bottom 5's), heavily zero-padded, resembling noise rather than a cohesive object. This mismatches what a correct extraction should be: likely a tight square crop of the central-right 3/4/5 pattern (rows ~11-15, columns ~7-18 or similar, forming a shape like in training 2), padded to ~9x9 or 10x10, omitting top-left 3's/5's and bottom 5's as secondary. The output includes extraneous elements (e.g., top 3's in row 3, lone 4 in row 2) and excessive empty space, indicating the row block selection grabbed too much (probably rows 0-18 via poor density), failing to isolate the main clustered object around the 3/4/5 block.

[2025-10-03 14:32:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop a grid to focus on the "main" or central non-zero content (likely a symbol, digit, or pattern formed by numbers like 3, 5, 6, 8 representing filled pixels or segments), then pad it symmetrically with zeros to form a square grid of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, while preserving the relative positions and ensuring alignment matches the expected output. The process involves identifying contiguous rows with significant non-zero activity, computing tight column bounds within those rows, cropping, and centering via padding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping must use the tightest bounding box around the main object, but only for contiguous rows that form the core pattern—do not include isolated border rows or rows with minimal/sparse non-zeros if they are not part of the contiguous block, as this can shift the content left/right or include/exclude elements incorrectly.
 * Padding must be centered (even distribution on top/bottom and left/right), but the side length is the max of cropped height/width; however, if the input is already square-like, avoid over-padding or shifting the content asymmetrically.
 * Subtle element: The "main" row for starting the crop is the one with the highest non-zero count, but the contiguous block must extend only to rows where counts >0 without skipping zeros inside the object (but zeros inside are okay if part of the pattern); overlooking internal zero rows within the object can truncate it.
 * Grids may have border-like zeros or sparse rows (e.g., single non-zeros) that should be excluded from the crop to avoid including "frames" or artifacts, but the expected outputs sometimes retain specific sparse elements if they are integral to the pattern's edges.
 * Column bounds must be computed per the selected row range, but min/max columns should ignore empty rows within the range—easy to miss if bounds include padding from empty sub-rows.
 * Patterns involve numbers (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6/4/5 for fills), so treat all non-zero as "filled" for counting/bounds, but preserve exact values in output.
 * Inputs are rectangular lists of lists, outputs must be square and exactly match expected row-by-row, including zero placements.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return [[0]]; sparse patterns may require manual adjustment if auto-contiguous misses disconnected but related parts (though examples suggest patterns are contiguous).
 * From attempts: Row extension (start/end) works for dense centers but fails if the max-count row is not perfectly centered in the object, leading to asymmetric crops; padding functions are correct but applied after wrong crop, causing shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_count(row: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [row_nonzero_count(row) for row in g]

def find_max_count_row(counts: List[int]) -> int:
    if not counts:
        return 0
    max_i = 0
    max_c = counts[0]
    for i in range(1, len(counts)):
        if counts[i] > max_c:
            max_c = counts[i]
            max_i = i
    return max_i

def find_start_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    s = start
    while s > 0 and counts[s - 1] > 0:
        s -= 1
    return s

def find_end_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    e = start
    n = len(counts)
    while e < n - 1 and counts[e + 1] > 0:
        e += 1
    return e
```
These are helpful for identifying the core row range based on non-zero density.

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds

def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, n_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c

def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
These are useful for per-row and aggregate bounds, and basic cropping; they correctly compute min/max but fail if row range is wrong.

```python
def pad_columns(cropped: List[List[int]], target_width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_width = len(cropped[0])
    if current_width >= target_width:
        return cropped
    col_pad_left = (target_width - current_width) // 2
    col_pad_right = target_width - current_width - col_pad_left
    for r in range(len(cropped)):
        cropped[r] = [0] * col_pad_left + cropped[r] + [0] * col_pad_right
    return cropped

def pad_rows(cropped: List[List[int]], target_size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_height = len(cropped)
    if current_height >= target_size:
        return cropped
    row_pad_top = (target_size - current_height) // 2
    row_pad_bottom = target_size - current_height - row_pad_top
    size = len(cropped[0])
    for _ in range(row_pad_top):
        cropped.insert(0, [0] * size)
    for _ in range(row_pad_bottom):
        cropped.append([0] * size)
    return cropped
```
These handle symmetric padding well and are not broken—use them after fixing crop.

 * The single attempt correctly identifies the max non-zero row and extends to contiguous non-zero rows, which works for dense central patterns but fails when the object has internal zero-count rows or when sparse edge rows (e.g., borders) should be excluded, leading to over-inclusion of empty space.
 * Cropping via row/column bounds is mostly right but computes min/max too broadly within the row range, including outliers from sparse rows, causing left-shifted content (e.g., in Train 1, generated row 0 has 3's at positions 2 and 4, but expected at 3 and 10, indicating wrong column start).
 * Padding to square is correct in logic (centered, max(h,w) side), but since crop is wrong, the final grid has shifted/misaligned patterns—e.g., Train 1 generated includes extra left zeros and wrong placements in rows 2-10 compared to expected (e.g., generated row 2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...], missing leading zeros and altering 3/8 positions).
 * Train 2 mismatches in row 1 (generated [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0], wrong 3 position) and row 3 (generated [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], extra 3's and shifted), suggesting column bounds grabbed too wide or wrong row range excluded top sparse rows.
 * Train 3 mismatches entirely in row ordering and content—generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips even/odd rows ([0,4,0,...] first), indicating the contiguous row finder or crop ignored the alternating border pattern, treating it as non-contiguous or wrong start row.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond bounds; a function to detect connected components (e.g., flood-fill for blobs) might help if patterns have disconnected parts, but current attempt lacks this—consider adding for future if contiguity fails.
 * The overall program(g) handles empty cases well but defaults to full grid crop if bounds fail, which over-pads without centering the true object.
 * Function `program` integrates everything but is broken due to row range logic—don't reuse without fixing start/end finders to skip zero-count rows outside the main block.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to crop/pad the entire input grid (13x13) with minimal trimming, resulting in large zero borders (e.g., rows 0-2 and 9-12 all zeros, content squeezed in rows 3-8 but shifted right with uneven columns, like 5's at edges but 3/4 patterns not centered). 
 * Compared to mentally running rules: The test input has a central cross-like pattern with 5's on sides, 3's in middle rows/columns, and a 4 in row 6 col 6; correct output should crop tightly to rows ~3-8 (height 6), columns ~3-9 (width 7, side=7), pad to 7x7 centered (e.g., add 0.5 rows top/bottom, 0 left/1 right), preserving exact 3/4/5 positions without the full 13x13 bloat or left/right shifts seen in generated (e.g., generated row 4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] includes outer 5's but expected would trim them if borders, centering the inner 3's and single 4).
 * It makes sense as a failed full-grid pad but not as correct extraction—missing tight crop leads to oversized zeros, and content alignment (e.g., 5's too far left in generated row 4) doesn't match a centered pattern; unknown why it didn't trim columns better, but likely because col_bounds took min_c=0 from edge 5's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely pixel art or ASCII-like representations with numbers as colors/values) where the goal is to extract or crop the "main object" or central content from a larger grid that includes borders, frames, or extraneous zero-padded areas. The extraction should produce a subgrid that matches the expected "clean" or bounded version of the object, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while trimming surrounding zeros appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid always has fixed dimensions (e.g., 20 columns in example 1, 10 in others), but the main object does not span the full width or height; borders often consist of patterned zeros or repeating non-zeros (e.g., 3's or 5's forming frames).
 * Non-zero rows are not always fully consecutive; there may be isolated zero rows at the top/bottom that should be excluded, but the "longest block" approach misses cases where the object has internal zero rows or irregular shapes.
 * Column cropping must account for the tightest bounding box per row group, but min/max columns are calculated per row in the block—subtleties include asymmetric objects where left/right edges vary, and zeros within the object should be preserved (not trimmed internally).
 * Objects may have "legs" or extensions (e.g., in example 1, the bottom row has sparse 3's that differ in generated vs. expected), requiring per-row min/max rather than global for the block.
 * All examples show symmetric or framed structures (e.g., 5's as borders in example 2, 4's in example 3), so extraction should ignore outer frames and focus on inner content; however, frames may integrate with the object (e.g., 3's in example 1 seem part of the object).
 * Expected outputs preserve some leading/trailing zeros within rows to maintain shape (e.g., example 1 expected has [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] vs. generated [0,0,3,0,3,...]), indicating no global left-trimming—crop to the union of all non-zero positions across the relevant rows.
 * Subtle element: The "object" may span nearly all rows but exclude thin top/bottom zero rows; in example 3, the object is rotated or checkerboard-patterned, and extraction flips or reorders rows/columns incorrectly.
 * Consider connectivity: Non-zeros may form disconnected blobs, but examples suggest extracting the primary connected component (e.g., ignore small isolated elements).
 * Height of extracted grid varies (13 rows in example 1, 10 in others), so dynamically determine start/end rows based on first/last non-all-zero rows, not just longest block.
 * Numbers represent colors/types (e.g., 3=one type, 8=another), so preserve exact values; zeros are background.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a longest consecutive non-zero row block to determine height, which worked partially for examples 1 and 2 (captured most rows) but failed in example 3 by including extra patterned rows (e.g., generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected starts with [0,4,0,...], indicating wrong row order or selection).
 * Global min/max column calculation worked for rough width in example 1 (13 cols output) but produced incorrect content: e.g., train 1 generated first row [0,0,3,0,3,0,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...], missing a leading zero and including an extra 3 early—likely due to min_c=1 instead of 3, shifting the slice left.
 * In train 2, generated included extraneous elements like [0,3,3,0,4,...] in row 4 vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], showing the uniform slice didn't align with the inner object's varying left edges (e.g., expected has more leading zeros in some rows).
 * Train 3 generated a near-full grid but mismatched row order and content: e.g., first row [4,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,...], and internal rows like generated [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—suggests the block finder took wrong start/end, and column slicing ignored the checkerboard symmetry.
 * The has_non_zero function is solid and essential for row detection.
 * find_longest_block is partially helpful but broken for gapped or framed objects (e.g., misses that example 3 has alternating non-zero rows throughout).
 * find_min_col and find_max_col are flawed—not helpful as-is, since they compute global bounds but objects need per-row trimming or union bounds that preserve internal spacing; using them leads to shifted or squished outputs.
 * Overall program demonstrates basic bounding box understanding but ignores frame detection and per-row variation, causing all mismatches; no object extraction beyond crude cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same flawed longest-block + global min/max column slicing, producing 7 rows of width 13, but the content shows irregular 5's and 3's that seem like a partial frame or object (e.g., first row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,...] suggests top border, but middle rows like [5,5,0,3,3,3,...] include outer 5's that may be frame elements to exclude).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: e.g., symmetric 5-borders in rows 2,4,6 suggest the output included frame instead of cropping to inner 3/4 content; the sparse bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,...] looks like it trimmed too much vertically, missing potential object extensions.
 * The output has varying non-zero positions (e.g., 3's clustered in cols 5-9, 5's on edges), indicating the global slice shifted everything left (min_c too low), distorting the shape—likely incorrect as it doesn't preserve the "clean" inner object seen in training expecteds.
 * No way to confirm exact expected without rules, but it fails to handle frame-like 5's (similar to train 2's borders), so probably needs frame detection or better row selection to exclude top/bottom zeros properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving sparse grids of integers (likely representing colored cells or patterns), where the goal is to extract a cropped subgrid that captures the "main" figure or object while removing extraneous empty (zero) borders or padding, resulting in a tighter, possibly rectangular bounding area around the non-zero content. The extraction should preserve the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but trim outer empty rows/columns to focus on the core pattern, without forcing a square shape or including unnecessary whitespace.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids are often large (e.g., 18x18 or 19x19) with significant empty (zero) areas on the borders, especially left/right columns and top/bottom rows; the output must crop these dynamically to the minimal or near-minimal bounding rectangle enclosing all non-zero cells, but not so aggressively that internal zeros (part of the pattern) are removed.
 * Outputs are rectangular, not necessarily square—e.g., training example 1 expects 13x13 but with irregular non-zero distribution; forcing square shapes (as in the current program) leads to oversized or misaligned extractions that include padding.
 * Non-zero cells form connected or semi-connected "objects" (e.g., borders, shapes like 3's, 8's, 6's in train1; 5's, 3's, 4's in train2; 4's and inner patterns in train3), and the extraction should encompass the largest or primary object without fragmenting it or including disconnected outliers.
 * Internal zeros within the pattern must be preserved (e.g., gaps in shapes), but outer pure-zero rows/columns should be trimmed; subtle elements include asymmetric padding (more empty on left in train1) and potential for multiple disjoint objects (e.g., small isolated cells in test input like bottom-right 5's).
 * The puzzle may involve identifying a "frame" or border (e.g., alternating 4's in train3) as part of the core pattern, so cropping shouldn't remove structural edges unless they are fully empty.
 * Grids can have varying sizes, so the program must compute bounds dynamically rather than hardcoding; consider row/column spans of non-zeros, but account for cases where the "main" object doesn't span the full height/width (e.g., train2 has empty middle rows in output? No, output includes them if part of bounds).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs can have leading/trailing zeros in rows if they are part of the pattern's edge (e.g., train1 row1 starts/ends with zeros), but entire rows/columns of zeros on the perimeter should be omitted; also, rotation or reordering (seen in train3 mismatch) isn't needed—extraction is positional cropping.
 * Across attempts (only one shown, but implied iterations): Prioritize bounding box over density; handle varying grid sizes without assuming square; avoid maximizing non-zeros in a square, as it grabs too-wide areas with padding (e.g., train1 includes 5+ left zeros per row).

    return [[g[i][j] for j in range(start_col, end_col)] for i in range(start_row, end_row)]
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `find_largest_square_block`: Broken for this puzzle—forces square (w == h) and maximizes non-zero count within it, leading to padded or oversized extractions (e.g., grabs full-width with left zeros in train1); ignores rectangular bounds and includes empty rows/columns; not relevant, as puzzle outputs aren't strictly square.
 * Current `program`: Relies on square finder, so always fails on asymmetric patterns; extracts too much padding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown uses a square-focused approach, which worked partially by identifying dense non-zero areas (e.g., captured most of the 3/8/6 patterns in train1) but failed by including excessive left/top/bottom padding zeros, resulting in oversized/wider outputs (18 cols vs. expected 13 in train1; 15 vs. 10 in train2).
 * Train1: Generated a near-full grid with 5+ leading zeros per row and extra bottom empty rows, mismatching expected cropped version (starts trimming at col 3, ends at col 15-ish, removes left empty block); unknown why it picked h=11 starting at row 0, but it over-included empties; nz maximization grabbed too-wide span (min_c=6, w=11? but still padded).
 * Train2: Generated included extra left/right empties and mismatched row lengths (15 vs. 10), capturing 5/3/4 patterns but with padding (e.g., leading zeros in rows); failed to crop tightly around the central object, adding irrelevant empty rows at bottom.
 * Train3: Generated almost the full 10x10 but with rows 1-2 swapped and inner pattern misaligned (e.g., row3 has [4,0,0,0,0,1,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,...]), suggesting wrong start/min_col (perhaps picked h=10, s=0, min_c=0 including border but shifting?); close in size but positionally wrong, missing subtle inner crop.
 * extract_subgrid is mostly helpful but limited to square (h-wide); get_nonzero_cols_per_row is essential for span detection but underused (only for min/max col, not full bounds).
 * Overall: Missed rectangular cropping; considered density over bounds; no handling for asymmetric empties; train samples all failed due to padding inclusion; function forcing square is incorrect (don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it extracts a very wide (19 cols?) rectangular strip starting from the left, including massive empty padding (e.g., rows 1-5 have 3-18 leading zeros before any non-zero like 5 or 3), and captures disjoint elements (top-left 3's, mid-right 5's block, bottom 3/4/5 patterns) without tight cropping, resulting in a sparse, non-focused grid that doesn't isolate a "main" figure.
 * It mismatches what a correct output should be: mentally, the test input has a small top-left 3/5 cluster (rows 0-4, cols 0-3), a mid-right 5's block (rows 6-8, cols 11-14), a large bottom-center 3/4/5 object (rows 10-14, cols 6-17), and scattered bottom 5's (rows 17-18); a correct extraction likely needs to bound the largest/dominant object (bottom 3/4/5, ~5x12), cropping to ~ rows 10-15, cols 6-18, yielding a tighter 6x13 with preserved internals, not the full padded mess; current output includes irrelevant top empties and doesn't focus, making it look like a raw dump rather than a puzzle solution.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of numbers (likely representing pixel-like patterns or objects with different values like 3,5,8,4,6,1,2 indicating colors, shapes, or densities), where the goal is to automatically detect, extract, and isolate the "main" or central patterned object(s) by cropping to their bounding box and padding to a square grid, while removing extraneous empty space, noise, or secondary elements. The output must match the expected clean, centered square representations exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements within the object.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids contain multiple potential "objects" or patterns (e.g., scattered numbers like 3's forming borders, 8's in shapes, 5's in lines), but only the primary cohesive one(s) should be extracted—secondary or isolated elements (e.g., lone 8's at the bottom in training example 1, or small 3's/4's in example 2) must be omitted to avoid bloating the output.
 * Extraction involves identifying a contiguous block of rows and columns that tightly bounds the main object, not just the densest rows via sum of non-zeros; subtle connections (e.g., via adjacent non-zeros) or visual coherence (e.g., forming a recognizable shape like a figure or symbol) should guide selection, as pure density (Kadane's) misses vertically sparse but connected parts.
 * Padding must center the cropped object in a square of size equal to the max dimension of the crop, using zeros; however, over-padding or including empty rows/columns leads to mismatched sizes (e.g., generated outputs often have 19x19 with excessive zeros, while expected are smaller like 13x13 or 10x10).
 * Non-zero values must be preserved exactly (no alteration), and the output grid must be rectangular lists of lists, but represented as square after padding; subtle elements include handling irregular shapes where first/last non-zero columns vary per row, requiring global min/max bounds per block, but avoiding blocks that include disconnected noise.
 * Grids may have varying sizes (e.g., 19x19 in example 1, 17x17 in example 2), with empty borders or padding already present; extraction should ignore outer zeros but detect if the main object spans most of the grid or is offset.
 * Connected components (e.g., 4-connected or 8-connected non-zeros) might be key to identify "objects" rather than row sums, as current method grabs loose contiguous rows including gaps.
 * Edge cases: All-zero grids return [[0]]; single-object grids need tight crop; multiple objects require selecting the largest/coherent one (e.g., in example 3, ignore top scattered 1's and 4's, focus on central patterned block).
 * Outputs are shown as flattened rows but are 2D lists; mismatches often in size (too big) or content (extra zeros/noise included).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by selecting overly broad row blocks via flawed Kadane's on row non-zero sums, leading to inclusion of empty or sparse rows (e.g., in training 1, generated a 19x19 with bottom empty rows and side zeros, while expected is 13x13 tight crop of central 3/8/6 pattern; difference: extra padding and missed tight row 2-12 crop, omitting bottom 8's correctly but bloating size).
 * In training 2, generated scattered 5/3/4 elements across a large zero-padded grid, including isolated top/bottom parts, while expected is 10x10 tight extraction of central 5/3/4 shape; difference: wrong row selection (e.g., included row 2 with single 5, but expected starts from denser block), resulting in disconnected output.
 * In training 3, generated a mess with top scattered 1's/4's and bottom empty, missing the central 4/1/2 pattern; expected 10x10 vertical crop/pad of rows ~10-18; difference: selected wrong block (rows 2-3 and 9-18 loosely), ignoring main object's vertical span.
 * Cropping and padding functions worked technically (produced square outputs), but fed bad inputs, so outputs mismatched in content (extra zeros, wrong elements) and size.
 * No connected component analysis, so missed subtle object cohesion (e.g., 8-connected non-zeros for shapes); density sum overlooked vertical/horizontal sparsity in main objects.
 * Bug in Kadane's: The condition `if counts[i] > max_current + counts[i]` simplifies to `0 > max_current`, which is rarely true, causing incorrect start/end indices (e.g., often picks single high-density rows or full grid).
 * extract_objects not present, but would be essential—current approach lacks object detection, treating rows independently.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a large ~19x19 grid with scattered 5's, 3's, and 4's in disconnected patches (e.g., isolated 5's in rows 1-5 and 7-8, then a partial 3/4/5 shape in rows 11-15, plus bottom 5's), heavily zero-padded, resembling noise rather than a cohesive object. This mismatches what a correct extraction should be: likely a tight square crop of the central-right 3/4/5 pattern (rows ~11-15, columns ~7-18 or similar, forming a shape like in training 2), padded to ~9x9 or 10x10, omitting top-left 3's/5's and bottom 5's as secondary. The output includes extraneous elements (e.g., top 3's in row 3, lone 4 in row 2) and excessive empty space, indicating the row block selection grabbed too much (probably rows 0-18 via poor density), failing to isolate the main clustered object around the 3/4/5 block.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

These functions are helpful for basic analysis (emptiness, counts, bounds) and can be building blocks for better main block detection.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def find_main_block(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the start and end indices of the longest sequence of significant non-empty rows."""
    # This is broken: uses a fixed >2 threshold and longest streak, which includes/excludes wrong rows (e.g., sparse border rows in ex1/2, flips row order in ex3).
    # It fails to handle frame-like structures or non-contiguous significance.

    """Pad the cropped grid to a square by adding zero rows and columns centered."""
    # Generally correct for centering, but can produce oversized/off-center results if crop is wrong (e.g., 13x13 with uneven pads).
```
The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with different "colors" or values like 3,6,8) to extract the central or main non-zero content, crop it to a tight bounding box, and pad it symmetrically to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main block" should be identified as the longest consecutive sequence of rows with any non-zero elements, but care must be taken to exclude leading/trailing fully zero rows without including isolated zero rows within the block if they are structurally important (e.g., in example 1, internal zero positions are preserved but the block start/end must align precisely with the expected cropped area).
 * Column bounds must be computed only over the main row block, finding the minimal and maximal non-zero columns across those rows, but without expanding beyond the actual content—subtly, if a row in the block has no non-zeros (but is included in the block due to adjacency), its bounds should not affect min/max (current compute_col_bounds skips if l==-1, which is good, but may still misalign if block includes empty rows incorrectly).
 * Padding to square must be symmetric (centering the content) using zeros, first padding columns to match height, then rows to match the new width, but the target size is max(h,w) after cropping—issue is that if cropping misses parts, padding adds extra zeros in wrong places (e.g., in example 1, generated adds unintended non-zeros or shifts content left/right).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes with borders of zeros; the output should be square but retain the exact relative positions of non-zeros from the cropped area (e.g., example 2 shows misalignment in rows 3-4 where generated has [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] but expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], indicating column crop is too narrow or shifted).
 * Subtle element: Non-zeros represent "pixels" of different types (e.g., 3 might be borders, 6/8 fills), and the puzzle likely requires exact reproduction without altering values or introducing new ones—easy to miss that bounding box must be inclusive of all edge non-zeros but exclusive of outer empty space.
 * In example 3, the pattern alternates rows/columns, and generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips the starting row order, suggesting possible row reversal or reordering not handled (or wrong block detection includes extra).
 * General: Handle empty or all-zero grids by returning [[0]]; assume rectangular input; outputs are lists of lists, printed as rows.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), consider that main block detection uses row non-zero counts correctly but may over-include if zero rows are adjacent (e.g., example 1 generated includes row 0 with partial non-zeros? Wait, generated row 0 [0,0,3,0,3,...] suggests crop started too early or wrong min_c).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(x != 0 for x in row)
```
(This is useful for identifying dense rows.)

```python
def get_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:

                best_start = curr_start
            curr_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_len - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This identifies the longest run of non-empty rows, which is core but subtly fails if multiple blocks exist or if zeros inside should be included—worked partially for block length but wrong start in examples.)

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row min/max non-zero columns; essential for tight cropping, but only applied to main block rows.)

```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, num_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = num_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l != -1:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
(Combines row bounds for overall column crop; helpful but may yield empty if all rows in block are zero, leading to [[0]] fallback.)

```python
def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row_slice = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row_slice)
    return cropped
```
(Core cropping function; works for slicing but inherits errors from bounds.)

```python
def pad_dimension(lst: List[List[int]], target_size: int, is_rows: bool) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not lst:
        return [[0]]
    current_size = len(lst) if is_rows else len(lst[0])
    if current_size >= target_size:
        return lst
    pad_size = target_size - current_size
    left_or_top = pad_size // 2
    right_or_bottom = pad_size - left_or_top
    if is_rows:
        empty = [0] * len(lst[0])
        for _ in range(left_or_top):
            lst.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(right_or_bottom):
            lst.append(empty[:])
    else:
        for r in range(len(lst)):
            lst[r] = [0] * left_or_top + lst[r] + [0] * right_or_bottom
    return lst
```
(Handles symmetric zero-padding for dimensions; useful and correct in isolation, but applied after faulty crop leads to misaligned content.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    size = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, False)  # pad columns
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, True)   # pad rows
    return cropped
```
(Overall squaring logic; helpful but order matters—padding columns first then rows ensures square, but if w > h initially, row padding adds to height correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the concept of finding a main non-zero block via row counts and cropping to bounding box, which works for isolating content in dense grids but fails on precise start/end (e.g., Train 1 generated starts crop too early, including extraneous left-shifted 3's in row 0 and mismatches like row 2 [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—shifted right by 1 and wrong values at ends; unknown why exact mismatch but likely min_c off by 1).
 * Train 2: Cropping works for row block but column bounds too narrow, omitting right-side elements (generated row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—missing two 3's on right, extra 3 on left); padding adds zeros incorrectly around incomplete crop.
 * Train 3: Block detection includes wrong rows, leading to row order flip or extra borders (generated row 0 [4,0,4,...] vs expected row 0 [0,4,0,...]—seems like it cropped starting from an offset row and didn't reverse or adjust for alternating pattern).
 * find_main_block is helpful but broken for cases with internal zero rows that should be included (it skips on any zero count row, potentially splitting blocks—e.g., if a structural zero row has count=0 but is part of the object, it's excluded).
 * get_row_bounds and compute_col_bounds are essential and mostly correct but fail when block has varying widths, leading to over-tight crops.
 * pad_dimension and pad_to_square are not broken and helpful for final output, but unhelpful if upstream crop is wrong (don't modify, but ensure crop inputs are accurate).
 * Overall, no extraction of "objects" like connected components was attempted, which might be needed if multiple disjoint parts exist (not in this code, but could be relevant for subtleties like ignoring outliers); current approach assumes single main block.
 * Train 1 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., generated row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—extra 3 and wrong positions, likely from faulty end_r or max_c).
 * No function for connected component analysis or object extraction, which might be unhelpful here since the puzzle seems bounding-box based, not segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped a central 5x13-ish pattern (rows ~3-9 with 3's,5's,4's) but padded excessively to 13x13 with large zero borders, shifting the content downward and not centering it properly (e.g., non-zeros start at row 3, but expected likely tighter crop to rows 4-8, columns ~3-10, padded to ~7x7 square embedded in zeros without the wide empty top/bottom). 
 * It includes symmetric 5's on left/right but mismatches internal structure (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] suggests incomplete column crop, missing connections like the 4 in row 6); this doesn't make sense as a clean extraction—likely wrong min_c/max_c (too wide on sides, too narrow vertically) and over-pads without preserving the "object" shape (e.g., the cross-like 3's and inner 4 seem distorted). 
 * To handle test case, account for multiple horizontal bars (top/bottom 5's, middle 3's) by ensuring block includes all connected non-zeros vertically, even if sparse; current code probably picks a partial block, leading to missing top/bottom elements.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid processing, where the goal is to identify the primary "object" or contiguous region of non-zero values in a 2D grid (likely representing an image or shape), crop it to its tight bounding box, and then pad the result to form a square grid while preserving the content. The output should be a transformed grid that isolates and normalizes the main feature for comparison or rendering.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of rows of integers (0 for empty/background, non-zero for filled/object pixels), and the "object" is defined by contiguous sequences of rows with non-zero counts, ignoring isolated or sparse rows.
 * Focus on the largest contiguous block of rows with any non-zeros to avoid including noise or separate components; subtle elements include handling rows with varying non-zero positions (e.g., irregular shapes) and ensuring column bounds are computed only over the selected rows.
 * Cropping must create a tight bounding box: min/max columns based on the first/last non-zero in each relevant row, but aggregated globally to avoid over-cropping jagged edges.
 * Padding to square should center the content (symmetric or near-symmetric padding with zeros) and handle cases where height and width differ, potentially starting from a 1x1 zero grid if empty.
 * Edge cases: empty grids, all-zero rows/columns, single-row/column objects, or grids where non-zeros don't align perfectly; avoid assuming uniform row lengths or non-negative values.
 * Non-zero values might represent different "colors" or intensities, but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding/cropping; preserve original values in the output.
 * Subtlety: Contiguous blocks reset on zero-count rows, so multiple objects might exist, but only the largest is selected—easy to miss if code doesn't properly scan for max length.
 * Global bounds must initialize correctly (e.g., min_col to infinity or grid width, max_col to -1) to handle rows with no non-zeros within the block.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is solid for row density; use it to identify active rows.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing; efficiently computes non-zero counts per row.)

```python
def find_largest_contiguous_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_length = 0
    best_start = 0
    current_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            length = i - current_start
            if length > max_length:
                max_length = length
                best_start = current_start
            current_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_length - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This correctly identifies the start/end of the largest run of non-zero-count rows; essential for isolating the main object vertically. Handles edge cases like all-zero grid returning (0,-1) or similar.)

```python
def get_row_first_last(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n  # Initialize to full width (beyond any valid index)
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row horizontal bounds; note initialization of first to n and last to -1 to handle all-zero rows gracefully, where (n, -1) indicates empty.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []

        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
(Reliable for extracting subgrid; assumes valid indices and handles empty slices.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    size = max(h, w)
    # Pad columns first if needed
    if w < size:
        pad_left = (size - w) // 2
        pad_right = size - w - pad_left
        for i in range(h):
            grid[i] = [0] * pad_left + grid[i] + [0] * pad_right
        w = size
    # Pad rows if needed
    if h < size:
        pad_top = (size - h) // 2
        pad_bottom = size - h - pad_top
        empty = [0] * size
        for _ in range(pad_top):
            grid.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(pad_bottom):
            grid.append(empty[:])
    return grid
```
(Effective for centering and squaring; handles empty grids and asymmetric padding well, preserving original values.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt demonstrates partial understanding of the puzzle by correctly identifying the need for contiguous row selection, per-row bounds, tight cropping, and square padding, but fails entirely due to a runtime error in all cases.
 * What worked: The vertical block detection (find_largest_contiguous_block) and per-row bounds (get_row_first_last) are logically sound and would isolate the main object if integrated properly; cropping and padding functions execute without issues in isolation.
 * What didn't work: The compute_global_bounds function is broken—it incorrectly initializes min_c as len(bounds[0][0]), where bounds[0][0] is an int (column index), causing "object of type 'int' has no len()" error on all inputs; this prevents any successful execution, so no outputs are generated for analysis.
 * No training examples or test passed; all resulted in the same execution error, indicating the bug blocks the entire pipeline.
 * The approach assumes the largest contiguous non-zero row block is the "object," which aligns with puzzle subtleties (e.g., ignoring noise), but untested due to crash.
 * Function compute_global_bounds is broken and unhelpful in its current form (causes crash; don't use without fixing initialization to something like min_c = float('inf') or grid width, and max_c = -1, then update only if l != -1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to the len() on int bug, so no actual grid is generated—completely incorrect and unusable for verification.
 * Expected test output should be a square-padded bounding box of the main contiguous object (e.g., if test input has a central shape spanning rows 2-5 and columns 3-7, output would crop to that 4x5 region, pad to 5x5 with zeros around, preserving non-zeros); the error prevents any match, and without seeing the input grid, it's unclear if the approach would otherwise align, but the crash confirms it does not produce a valid result.
 * This highlights the need to handle empty or edge rows in bounds aggregation without assuming non-empty tuples.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns (likely representing shapes, figures, or "objects" with pixel values like 3,5,6,8,4 indicating colors or types), where the goal is to extract the "main" or primary figure/object from the input grid, normalize its position (e.g., translate to top-left), compute a bounding box, and output a square grid representation padded with zeros, while ignoring or excluding noise, frames, or secondary elements. The output size is based on the max dimension of the extracted region, but the results suggest the extraction criteria (e.g., row selection, bounding box) are imprecise, leading to inclusions/exclusions of pixels that don't match expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain a "main" figure (dense cluster of non-zero pixels) surrounded by potential noise, frames, or disconnected elements (e.g., sparse lines or dots outside the core shape); the program must identify and isolate only the primary connected or consecutive component, excluding outer frames or isolated pixels.
 * Y-range selection is critical: use consecutive rows with non-zero sums, but prioritize the block with maximum total non-zero pixels to avoid noise; however, subtle disconnected parts (e.g., small protrusions or separate blobs) may need inclusion if part of the main structure, or exclusion if they are artifacts.
 * Bounding box computation must tightly fit the main figure's extent (min/max x/y of non-zeros in selected rows), but avoid expanding to include frame-like borders; translation shifts to (0,0) origin, and output is a square of side max(width, height) of the bbox, padded with zeros—do not return the original n x n size unless s == n.
 * Subtleties include handling asymmetric shapes (e.g., figures not centered), multiple potential "main" blocks (select largest by sum or area), and ensuring no pixel values are altered during extraction/translation—only positions change.
 * Noise handling: Grids may have zero-rows or sparse rows above/below/around the main figure; do not include them in the y-range or bbox unless they connect to the main structure.
 * Output must preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within the extracted region; mismatches often occur in top/bottom rows (e.g., extra 3s included as noise) or side alignments (e.g., shifted 8s or 6s).
 * Consider connected components: The main figure may not be fully rectangular; use row_bounds to find per-row min/max x, but aggregate carefully to avoid over-expansion.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return zero-filled n x n; if no main block, output zeros; varying grid sizes (10x10 or 13x13) mean s can be < n, leading to smaller outputs implicitly padded in display.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect y-range (including noise rows) or bbox (missing/extruding parts), resulting in shifted or incomplete figures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several modular functions for row analysis and extraction, which are partially useful for identifying and isolating regions but need refinement for accurate main figure selection (e.g., better y-range logic or component detection). No new types are defined, but Tuple[int, int] for bounds and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for pixels (y,x,value) are effective for handling positions and values.

The main `program` function composes these but is flawed in y-range/bbox selection; no explicit object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) is present, which might be needed for complex shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (all training examples failed); it correctly implements modular extraction/translation/padding but fails on core selection logic.
 * What worked: Pixel extraction preserves values; translation to (0,0) normalizes position; square padding handles varying bbox sizes; row_sums and row_bounds efficiently identify dense regions without full scans.
 * What didn't work: Y-range selection via max-sum consecutive rows includes noise (e.g., top/bottom sparse rows with 3s in train1), leading to bbox that captures extras; no handling for disconnected components or frames, causing over-inclusion; output size s often matches n but with misplaced pixels due to wrong min_y/max_y.
 * Train1: Generated includes extra 3s in row0 (positions 2,4) and row12 (3s at 3,4), but expected has 3s at 3 and 10 in row0, and 3s at 5 and 7 in row12; inner figure (8s,6s) is shifted/missing parts (e.g., generated row2 has 8s at 2-3 but expected at 3; row10 has 8s at 8-9 but expected at 9 missing); overall, figure is vertically expanded with noise, horizontally misaligned (unknown reason, possibly bbox min_x too low).
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 at 3 but expected all 0s except row1 3 at 6; row3 has 3s at 1-2 but expected 3 at 2; row4 has 5 at 0,3 at 2 but expected 5 at 0,3s at 1-2; row5 matches somewhat but row6 has 4s missing in expected positions; figure is incomplete/shifted rightward, with extra 3s in noise rows (e.g., row1), suggesting wrong y-range including top noise.
 * Train3: Generated row0/1 are [4,0,4,...]/[0,4,0,...] but expected swapped to [0,4,0,...]/[4,0,4,...], indicating possible rotation or frame misextraction; inner 1s/2s are misplaced (e.g., generated row2 has 1 at 5 but expected row2 all 0s except 1s at 3-4; row4 has 2s at 4-5 but expected row4 2s at 4-5 ok, but surrounding 1s wrong); frame is included but inverted, inner figure vertically shifted down by ~1 row (unknown reason, likely y-range starts too early).
 * Function `get_main_bbox` is helpful but broken when y-range is noisy (propagates errors); `find_main_y_range` is essential but insufficient (needs connectivity or size threshold); no unhelpful functions, but the composition in `program` assumes single main block—add component detection for multi-blob grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of normalization but misses subtle noise exclusion and precise component isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it extracts a partial figure (5s on sides, 3s/4s in middle) but places it starting from row1 (with row0 as [0s,3,3,0s] like noise or bottom fragment), repeats the pattern in rows1-2/4-5 but inverts or shifts (e.g., row2 has 3s at 4-8 but test input row? has different), adds isolated 3 in row6 middle, then pads with 7+ zero rows— this suggests wrong y-range (included top noise, excluded bottom?), incomplete bbox (missing left/right alignments, e.g., 5s at 0-1 and 11-12 but 3s not centered), and over-padding without centering. Expected likely a tight square of the central cross-like figure (3s horizontal, 4s vertical-ish, framed by 5s) translated to top-left without extras, possibly 7x7 or similar s<13, but output bloats to 13x13 with misplaced elements (e.g., duplicated rows 1/5 and 2/4 indicate loop error or wrong min_y). It fails to isolate the main "plus" shape, including apparent noise 3s, and doesn't match a clean normalized output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 14:39:07] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting the "main" visual object or pattern from a sparse grid by identifying the bounding box of non-zero cells across relevant rows (not necessarily strictly consecutive), cropping to that subgrid, and then centering it within a square grid via symmetric padding with zeros, preserving the relative structure and values of the original content. The goal is to isolate and normalize the core artwork or symbol while ignoring outer noise or framing, but ensuring no distortion of internal zeros or shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main object" may span rows that are not fully consecutive non-zero counts; isolated zero rows within the object's vertical extent must be included if they are part of the bounding structure (e.g., gaps in patterns like letters or symbols), so the row selection should use the overall min-max row bounds of non-zeros rather than the longest consecutive block.
 * Column cropping must use the tightest bounding box across the selected rows, but padding must be centered (symmetric left/right, top/bottom) to maintain visual alignment, and the target square size should be based on the max of the cropped height/width without over-trimming internal structure.
 * Subtle elements include preserving exact non-zero values (e.g., 3,8,6) and their positions, including internal zeros that define shapes (e.g., holes in blobs); over-cropping can merge or shift these, leading to mismatches.
 * Grids may have outer zero framing or noise (e.g., stray non-zeros), which should be excluded; the output is always square, but size varies based on content (e.g., 13x13 for Train1, 10x10 for Train2/3).
 * Handle empty or all-zero inputs by returning a minimal [[0]] or similar, but real cases have clear central patterns.
 * Padding must not introduce asymmetry; use integer division for even/odd splits to center properly.
 * Non-zero count per row helps identify active rows, but the block-finding logic fails when the object has vertical gaps (common in puzzles like ASCII art or pixel drawings).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements row non-zero counting, per-row bounds, subgrid cropping, and centered padding to square, which works for dense objects without gaps (e.g., partial credit for column alignment in some cases).
 * Failed to select the full vertical extent of the object by using longest consecutive non-zero row block, excluding necessary gapped zero rows (e.g., in Train1, cropped rows 1-11 excluding top/bottom framing, leading to shifted content and mismatched shapes like extra 3's in row 0 col 2 vs. expected zero).
 * In Train1, generated output includes incorrect values/positions (e.g., row 2 has [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] but expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...]; row 5 has [0,3,8,8,6,6,...] but expected [3,3,8,8,6,6,...]—unknown reason for vertical shift/misalignment, possibly from wrong start_r).
 * Train2 generated mismatches in internal structure (e.g., row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], adding extra 3's and shifting 4's; row 4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs. expected [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0], wrong blob connectivity).
 * Train3 generated flips or misaligns patterns (e.g., row 0 [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]; entire top/bottom borders swapped, and internal 1/2 placements off like row 2 [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4]).
 * find_longest_block function is broken for gapped objects (assumes consecutive density, misses full height); not helpful for this puzzle—replace with overall min/max row of any non-zero.
 * No object extraction beyond density; lacks function to find global min/max row/col of all non-zeros, which would fix row selection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped too narrowly vertically (content only in rows 3-8 of 13, with symmetric zero padding top/bottom, but likely excludes parts of a taller object with gaps, similar to Train failures).
 * It centers a sub-pattern (e.g., 3's and 5's forming a shape with 4's inside), but the full 13x13 suggests the object spans more rows (e.g., top/bottom 5's and 3's may connect via sparse rows), leading to potential misalignment if gapped rows like row 3/9 are omitted.
 * Horizontal cropping seems okay (tight around cols 3-10), but vertical misses full extent (e.g., if test has framing like Train1, output should include more zero-gapped rows for correct shape like a letter or symbol).
 * Padding to 13x13 is oversized if object is smaller, but makes sense if global bounds are used; however, the isolated central block ignores potential outer connections, making the output incomplete (e.g., top/bottom rows all zero except possibly stray, but expected likely has adjusted framing).

[2025-10-03 14:39:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop a grid to focus on the "main" or central non-zero content (likely a symbol, digit, or pattern formed by numbers like 3, 5, 6, 8 representing filled pixels or segments), then pad it symmetrically with zeros to form a square grid of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, while preserving the relative positions and ensuring alignment matches the expected output. The process involves identifying contiguous rows with significant non-zero activity, computing tight column bounds within those rows, cropping, and centering via padding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping must use the tightest bounding box around the main object, but only for contiguous rows that form the core pattern—do not include isolated border rows or rows with minimal/sparse non-zeros if they are not part of the contiguous block, as this can shift the content left/right or include/exclude elements incorrectly.
 * Padding must be centered (even distribution on top/bottom and left/right), but the side length is the max of cropped height/width; however, if the input is already square-like, avoid over-padding or shifting the content asymmetrically.
 * Subtle element: The "main" row for starting the crop is the one with the highest non-zero count, but the contiguous block must extend only to rows where counts >0 without skipping zeros inside the object (but zeros inside are okay if part of the pattern); overlooking internal zero rows within the object can truncate it.
 * Grids may have border-like zeros or sparse rows (e.g., single non-zeros) that should be excluded from the crop to avoid including "frames" or artifacts, but the expected outputs sometimes retain specific sparse elements if they are integral to the pattern's edges.
 * Column bounds must be computed per the selected row range, but min/max columns should ignore empty rows within the range—easy to miss if bounds include padding from empty sub-rows.
 * Patterns involve numbers (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6/4/5 for fills), so treat all non-zero as "filled" for counting/bounds, but preserve exact values in output.
 * Inputs are rectangular lists of lists, outputs must be square and exactly match expected row-by-row, including zero placements.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return [[0]]; sparse patterns may require manual adjustment if auto-contiguous misses disconnected but related parts (though examples suggest patterns are contiguous).
 * From attempts: Row extension (start/end) works for dense centers but fails if the max-count row is not perfectly centered in the object, leading to asymmetric crops; padding functions are correct but applied after wrong crop, causing shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_count(row: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [row_nonzero_count(row) for row in g]

def find_max_count_row(counts: List[int]) -> int:
    if not counts:
        return 0
    max_i = 0
    max_c = counts[0]
    for i in range(1, len(counts)):
        if counts[i] > max_c:
            max_c = counts[i]
            max_i = i
    return max_i

def find_start_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    s = start
    while s > 0 and counts[s - 1] > 0:
        s -= 1
    return s

def find_end_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    e = start
    n = len(counts)
    while e < n - 1 and counts[e + 1] > 0:
        e += 1
    return e
```
These are helpful for identifying the core row range based on non-zero density.

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds

def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, n_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c

def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
These are useful for per-row and aggregate bounds, and basic cropping; they correctly compute min/max but fail if row range is wrong.

```python
def pad_columns(cropped: List[List[int]], target_width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_width = len(cropped[0])
    if current_width >= target_width:
        return cropped
    col_pad_left = (target_width - current_width) // 2
    col_pad_right = target_width - current_width - col_pad_left
    for r in range(len(cropped)):
        cropped[r] = [0] * col_pad_left + cropped[r] + [0] * col_pad_right
    return cropped

def pad_rows(cropped: List[List[int]], target_size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_height = len(cropped)
    if current_height >= target_size:
        return cropped
    row_pad_top = (target_size - current_height) // 2
    row_pad_bottom = target_size - current_height - row_pad_top
    size = len(cropped[0])
    for _ in range(row_pad_top):
        cropped.insert(0, [0] * size)
    for _ in range(row_pad_bottom):
        cropped.append([0] * size)
    return cropped
```
These handle symmetric padding well and are not broken—use them after fixing crop.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the max non-zero row and extends to contiguous non-zero rows, which works for dense central patterns but fails when the object has internal zero-count rows or when sparse edge rows (e.g., borders) should be excluded, leading to over-inclusion of empty space.
 * Cropping via row/column bounds is mostly right but computes min/max too broadly within the row range, including outliers from sparse rows, causing left-shifted content (e.g., in Train 1, generated row 0 has 3's at positions 2 and 4, but expected at 3 and 10, indicating wrong column start).
 * Padding to square is correct in logic (centered, max(h,w) side), but since crop is wrong, the final grid has shifted/misaligned patterns—e.g., Train 1 generated includes extra left zeros and wrong placements in rows 2-10 compared to expected (e.g., generated row 2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...], missing leading zeros and altering 3/8 positions).
 * Train 2 mismatches in row 1 (generated [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0], wrong 3 position) and row 3 (generated [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], extra 3's and shifted), suggesting column bounds grabbed too wide or wrong row range excluded top sparse rows.
 * Train 3 mismatches entirely in row ordering and content—generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips even/odd rows ([0,4,0,...] first), indicating the contiguous row finder or crop ignored the alternating border pattern, treating it as non-contiguous or wrong start row.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond bounds; a function to detect connected components (e.g., flood-fill for blobs) might help if patterns have disconnected parts, but current attempt lacks this—consider adding for future if contiguity fails.
 * The overall program(g) handles empty cases well but defaults to full grid crop if bounds fail, which over-pads without centering the true object.
 * Function `program` integrates everything but is broken due to row range logic—don't reuse without fixing start/end finders to skip zero-count rows outside the main block.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to crop/pad the entire input grid (13x13) with minimal trimming, resulting in large zero borders (e.g., rows 0-2 and 9-12 all zeros, content squeezed in rows 3-8 but shifted right with uneven columns, like 5's at edges but 3/4 patterns not centered). 
 * Compared to mentally running rules: The test input has a central cross-like pattern with 5's on sides, 3's in middle rows/columns, and a 4 in row 6 col 6; correct output should crop tightly to rows ~3-8 (height 6), columns ~3-9 (width 7, side=7), pad to 7x7 centered (e.g., add 0.5 rows top/bottom, 0 left/1 right), preserving exact 3/4/5 positions without the full 13x13 bloat or left/right shifts seen in generated (e.g., generated row 4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] includes outer 5's but expected would trim them if borders, centering the inner 3's and single 4).
 * It makes sense as a failed full-grid pad but not as correct extraction—missing tight crop leads to oversized zeros, and content alignment (e.g., 5's too far left in generated row 4) doesn't match a centered pattern; unknown why it didn't trim columns better, but likely because col_bounds took min_c=0 from edge 5's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely pixel art or ASCII-like representations with numbers as colors/values) where the goal is to extract or crop the "main object" or central content from a larger grid that includes borders, frames, or extraneous zero-padded areas. The extraction should produce a subgrid that matches the expected "clean" or bounded version of the object, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while trimming surrounding zeros appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid always has fixed dimensions (e.g., 20 columns in example 1, 10 in others), but the main object does not span the full width or height; borders often consist of patterned zeros or repeating non-zeros (e.g., 3's or 5's forming frames).
 * Non-zero rows are not always fully consecutive; there may be isolated zero rows at the top/bottom that should be excluded, but the "longest block" approach misses cases where the object has internal zero rows or irregular shapes.
 * Column cropping must account for the tightest bounding box per row group, but min/max columns are calculated per row in the block—subtleties include asymmetric objects where left/right edges vary, and zeros within the object should be preserved (not trimmed internally).
 * Objects may have "legs" or extensions (e.g., in example 1, the bottom row has sparse 3's that differ in generated vs. expected), requiring per-row min/max rather than global for the block.
 * All examples show symmetric or framed structures (e.g., 5's as borders in example 2, 4's in example 3), so extraction should ignore outer frames and focus on inner content; however, frames may integrate with the object (e.g., 3's in example 1 seem part of the object).
 * Expected outputs preserve some leading/trailing zeros within rows to maintain shape (e.g., example 1 expected has [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] vs. generated [0,0,3,0,3,...]), indicating no global left-trimming—crop to the union of all non-zero positions across the relevant rows.
 * Subtle element: The "object" may span nearly all rows but exclude thin top/bottom zero rows; in example 3, the object is rotated or checkerboard-patterned, and extraction flips or reorders rows/columns incorrectly.
 * Consider connectivity: Non-zeros may form disconnected blobs, but examples suggest extracting the primary connected component (e.g., ignore small isolated elements).
 * Height of extracted grid varies (13 rows in example 1, 10 in others), so dynamically determine start/end rows based on first/last non-all-zero rows, not just longest block.
 * Numbers represent colors/types (e.g., 3=one type, 8=another), so preserve exact values; zeros are background.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a longest consecutive non-zero row block to determine height, which worked partially for examples 1 and 2 (captured most rows) but failed in example 3 by including extra patterned rows (e.g., generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected starts with [0,4,0,...], indicating wrong row order or selection).
 * Global min/max column calculation worked for rough width in example 1 (13 cols output) but produced incorrect content: e.g., train 1 generated first row [0,0,3,0,3,0,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...], missing a leading zero and including an extra 3 early—likely due to min_c=1 instead of 3, shifting the slice left.
 * In train 2, generated included extraneous elements like [0,3,3,0,4,...] in row 4 vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], showing the uniform slice didn't align with the inner object's varying left edges (e.g., expected has more leading zeros in some rows).
 * Train 3 generated a near-full grid but mismatched row order and content: e.g., first row [4,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,...], and internal rows like generated [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—suggests the block finder took wrong start/end, and column slicing ignored the checkerboard symmetry.
 * The has_non_zero function is solid and essential for row detection.
 * find_longest_block is partially helpful but broken for gapped or framed objects (e.g., misses that example 3 has alternating non-zero rows throughout).
 * find_min_col and find_max_col are flawed—not helpful as-is, since they compute global bounds but objects need per-row trimming or union bounds that preserve internal spacing; using them leads to shifted or squished outputs.
 * Overall program demonstrates basic bounding box understanding but ignores frame detection and per-row variation, causing all mismatches; no object extraction beyond crude cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same flawed longest-block + global min/max column slicing, producing 7 rows of width 13, but the content shows irregular 5's and 3's that seem like a partial frame or object (e.g., first row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,...] suggests top border, but middle rows like [5,5,0,3,3,3,...] include outer 5's that may be frame elements to exclude).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: e.g., symmetric 5-borders in rows 2,4,6 suggest the output included frame instead of cropping to inner 3/4 content; the sparse bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,...] looks like it trimmed too much vertically, missing potential object extensions.
 * The output has varying non-zero positions (e.g., 3's clustered in cols 5-9, 5's on edges), indicating the global slice shifted everything left (min_c too low), distorting the shape—likely incorrect as it doesn't preserve the "clean" inner object seen in training expecteds.
 * No way to confirm exact expected without rules, but it fails to handle frame-like 5's (similar to train 2's borders), so probably needs frame detection or better row selection to exclude top/bottom zeros properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving sparse grids of integers (likely representing colored cells or patterns), where the goal is to extract a cropped subgrid that captures the "main" figure or object while removing extraneous empty (zero) borders or padding, resulting in a tighter, possibly rectangular bounding area around the non-zero content. The extraction should preserve the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but trim outer empty rows/columns to focus on the core pattern, without forcing a square shape or including unnecessary whitespace.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids are often large (e.g., 18x18 or 19x19) with significant empty (zero) areas on the borders, especially left/right columns and top/bottom rows; the output must crop these dynamically to the minimal or near-minimal bounding rectangle enclosing all non-zero cells, but not so aggressively that internal zeros (part of the pattern) are removed.
 * Outputs are rectangular, not necessarily square—e.g., training example 1 expects 13x13 but with irregular non-zero distribution; forcing square shapes (as in the current program) leads to oversized or misaligned extractions that include padding.
 * Non-zero cells form connected or semi-connected "objects" (e.g., borders, shapes like 3's, 8's, 6's in train1; 5's, 3's, 4's in train2; 4's and inner patterns in train3), and the extraction should encompass the largest or primary object without fragmenting it or including disconnected outliers.
 * Internal zeros within the pattern must be preserved (e.g., gaps in shapes), but outer pure-zero rows/columns should be trimmed; subtle elements include asymmetric padding (more empty on left in train1) and potential for multiple disjoint objects (e.g., small isolated cells in test input like bottom-right 5's).
 * The puzzle may involve identifying a "frame" or border (e.g., alternating 4's in train3) as part of the core pattern, so cropping shouldn't remove structural edges unless they are fully empty.
 * Grids can have varying sizes, so the program must compute bounds dynamically rather than hardcoding; consider row/column spans of non-zeros, but account for cases where the "main" object doesn't span the full height/width (e.g., train2 has empty middle rows in output? No, output includes them if part of bounds).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs can have leading/trailing zeros in rows if they are part of the pattern's edge (e.g., train1 row1 starts/ends with zeros), but entire rows/columns of zeros on the perimeter should be omitted; also, rotation or reordering (seen in train3 mismatch) isn't needed—extraction is positional cropping.
 * Across attempts (only one shown, but implied iterations): Prioritize bounding box over density; handle varying grid sizes without assuming square; avoid maximizing non-zeros in a square, as it grabs too-wide areas with padding (e.g., train1 includes 5+ left zeros per row).

    return [[g[i][j] for j in range(start_col, end_col)] for i in range(start_row, end_row)]
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `find_largest_square_block`: Broken for this puzzle—forces square (w == h) and maximizes non-zero count within it, leading to padded or oversized extractions (e.g., grabs full-width with left zeros in train1); ignores rectangular bounds and includes empty rows/columns; not relevant, as puzzle outputs aren't strictly square.
 * Current `program`: Relies on square finder, so always fails on asymmetric patterns; extracts too much padding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown uses a square-focused approach, which worked partially by identifying dense non-zero areas (e.g., captured most of the 3/8/6 patterns in train1) but failed by including excessive left/top/bottom padding zeros, resulting in oversized/wider outputs (18 cols vs. expected 13 in train1; 15 vs. 10 in train2).
 * Train1: Generated a near-full grid with 5+ leading zeros per row and extra bottom empty rows, mismatching expected cropped version (starts trimming at col 3, ends at col 15-ish, removes left empty block); unknown why it picked h=11 starting at row 0, but it over-included empties; nz maximization grabbed too-wide span (min_c=6, w=11? but still padded).
 * Train2: Generated included extra left/right empties and mismatched row lengths (15 vs. 10), capturing 5/3/4 patterns but with padding (e.g., leading zeros in rows); failed to crop tightly around the central object, adding irrelevant empty rows at bottom.
 * Train3: Generated almost the full 10x10 but with rows 1-2 swapped and inner pattern misaligned (e.g., row3 has [4,0,0,0,0,1,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,...]), suggesting wrong start/min_col (perhaps picked h=10, s=0, min_c=0 including border but shifting?); close in size but positionally wrong, missing subtle inner crop.
 * extract_subgrid is mostly helpful but limited to square (h-wide); get_nonzero_cols_per_row is essential for span detection but underused (only for min/max col, not full bounds).
 * Overall: Missed rectangular cropping; considered density over bounds; no handling for asymmetric empties; train samples all failed due to padding inclusion; function forcing square is incorrect (don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it extracts a very wide (19 cols?) rectangular strip starting from the left, including massive empty padding (e.g., rows 1-5 have 3-18 leading zeros before any non-zero like 5 or 3), and captures disjoint elements (top-left 3's, mid-right 5's block, bottom 3/4/5 patterns) without tight cropping, resulting in a sparse, non-focused grid that doesn't isolate a "main" figure.
 * It mismatches what a correct output should be: mentally, the test input has a small top-left 3/5 cluster (rows 0-4, cols 0-3), a mid-right 5's block (rows 6-8, cols 11-14), a large bottom-center 3/4/5 object (rows 10-14, cols 6-17), and scattered bottom 5's (rows 17-18); a correct extraction likely needs to bound the largest/dominant object (bottom 3/4/5, ~5x12), cropping to ~ rows 10-15, cols 6-18, yielding a tighter 6x13 with preserved internals, not the full padded mess; current output includes irrelevant top empties and doesn't focus, making it look like a raw dump rather than a puzzle solution.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of numbers (likely representing pixel-like patterns or objects with different values like 3,5,8,4,6,1,2 indicating colors, shapes, or densities), where the goal is to automatically detect, extract, and isolate the "main" or central patterned object(s) by cropping to their bounding box and padding to a square grid, while removing extraneous empty space, noise, or secondary elements. The output must match the expected clean, centered square representations exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements within the object.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids contain multiple potential "objects" or patterns (e.g., scattered numbers like 3's forming borders, 8's in shapes, 5's in lines), but only the primary cohesive one(s) should be extracted—secondary or isolated elements (e.g., lone 8's at the bottom in training example 1, or small 3's/4's in example 2) must be omitted to avoid bloating the output.
 * Extraction involves identifying a contiguous block of rows and columns that tightly bounds the main object, not just the densest rows via sum of non-zeros; subtle connections (e.g., via adjacent non-zeros) or visual coherence (e.g., forming a recognizable shape like a figure or symbol) should guide selection, as pure density (Kadane's) misses vertically sparse but connected parts.
 * Padding must center the cropped object in a square of size equal to the max dimension of the crop, using zeros; however, over-padding or including empty rows/columns leads to mismatched sizes (e.g., generated outputs often have 19x19 with excessive zeros, while expected are smaller like 13x13 or 10x10).
 * Non-zero values must be preserved exactly (no alteration), and the output grid must be rectangular lists of lists, but represented as square after padding; subtle elements include handling irregular shapes where first/last non-zero columns vary per row, requiring global min/max bounds per block, but avoiding blocks that include disconnected noise.
 * Grids may have varying sizes (e.g., 19x19 in example 1, 17x17 in example 2), with empty borders or padding already present; extraction should ignore outer zeros but detect if the main object spans most of the grid or is offset.
 * Connected components (e.g., 4-connected or 8-connected non-zeros) might be key to identify "objects" rather than row sums, as current method grabs loose contiguous rows including gaps.
 * Edge cases: All-zero grids return [[0]]; single-object grids need tight crop; multiple objects require selecting the largest/coherent one (e.g., in example 3, ignore top scattered 1's and 4's, focus on central patterned block).
 * Outputs are shown as flattened rows but are 2D lists; mismatches often in size (too big) or content (extra zeros/noise included).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by selecting overly broad row blocks via flawed Kadane's on row non-zero sums, leading to inclusion of empty or sparse rows (e.g., in training 1, generated a 19x19 with bottom empty rows and side zeros, while expected is 13x13 tight crop of central 3/8/6 pattern; difference: extra padding and missed tight row 2-12 crop, omitting bottom 8's correctly but bloating size).
 * In training 2, generated scattered 5/3/4 elements across a large zero-padded grid, including isolated top/bottom parts, while expected is 10x10 tight extraction of central 5/3/4 shape; difference: wrong row selection (e.g., included row 2 with single 5, but expected starts from denser block), resulting in disconnected output.
 * In training 3, generated a mess with top scattered 1's/4's and bottom empty, missing the central 4/1/2 pattern; expected 10x10 vertical crop/pad of rows ~10-18; difference: selected wrong block (rows 2-3 and 9-18 loosely), ignoring main object's vertical span.
 * Cropping and padding functions worked technically (produced square outputs), but fed bad inputs, so outputs mismatched in content (extra zeros, wrong elements) and size.
 * No connected component analysis, so missed subtle object cohesion (e.g., 8-connected non-zeros for shapes); density sum overlooked vertical/horizontal sparsity in main objects.
 * Bug in Kadane's: The condition `if counts[i] > max_current + counts[i]` simplifies to `0 > max_current`, which is rarely true, causing incorrect start/end indices (e.g., often picks single high-density rows or full grid).
 * extract_objects not present, but would be essential—current approach lacks object detection, treating rows independently.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a large ~19x19 grid with scattered 5's, 3's, and 4's in disconnected patches (e.g., isolated 5's in rows 1-5 and 7-8, then a partial 3/4/5 shape in rows 11-15, plus bottom 5's), heavily zero-padded, resembling noise rather than a cohesive object. This mismatches what a correct extraction should be: likely a tight square crop of the central-right 3/4/5 pattern (rows ~11-15, columns ~7-18 or similar, forming a shape like in training 2), padded to ~9x9 or 10x10, omitting top-left 3's/5's and bottom 5's as secondary. The output includes extraneous elements (e.g., top 3's in row 3, lone 4 in row 2) and excessive empty space, indicating the row block selection grabbed too much (probably rows 0-18 via poor density), failing to isolate the main clustered object around the 3/4/5 block.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with different "colors" or values like 3,6,8) to extract the central or main non-zero content, crop it to a tight bounding box, and pad it symmetrically to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main block" should be identified as the longest consecutive sequence of rows with any non-zero elements, but care must be taken to exclude leading/trailing fully zero rows without including isolated zero rows within the block if they are structurally important (e.g., in example 1, internal zero positions are preserved but the block start/end must align precisely with the expected cropped area).
 * Column bounds must be computed only over the main row block, finding the minimal and maximal non-zero columns across those rows, but without expanding beyond the actual content—subtly, if a row in the block has no non-zeros (but is included in the block due to adjacency), its bounds should not affect min/max (current compute_col_bounds skips if l==-1, which is good, but may still misalign if block includes empty rows incorrectly).
 * Padding to square must be symmetric (centering the content) using zeros, first padding columns to match height, then rows to match the new width, but the target size is max(h,w) after cropping—issue is that if cropping misses parts, padding adds extra zeros in wrong places (e.g., in example 1, generated adds unintended non-zeros or shifts content left/right).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes with borders of zeros; the output should be square but retain the exact relative positions of non-zeros from the cropped area (e.g., example 2 shows misalignment in rows 3-4 where generated has [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] but expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], indicating column crop is too narrow or shifted).
 * Subtle element: Non-zeros represent "pixels" of different types (e.g., 3 might be borders, 6/8 fills), and the puzzle likely requires exact reproduction without altering values or introducing new ones—easy to miss that bounding box must be inclusive of all edge non-zeros but exclusive of outer empty space.
 * In example 3, the pattern alternates rows/columns, and generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips the starting row order, suggesting possible row reversal or reordering not handled (or wrong block detection includes extra).
 * General: Handle empty or all-zero grids by returning [[0]]; assume rectangular input; outputs are lists of lists, printed as rows.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), consider that main block detection uses row non-zero counts correctly but may over-include if zero rows are adjacent (e.g., example 1 generated includes row 0 with partial non-zeros? Wait, generated row 0 [0,0,3,0,3,...] suggests crop started too early or wrong min_c).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(x != 0 for x in row)
```
(This is useful for identifying dense rows.)

```python
def get_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing row densities to find blocks.)

```python
def find_main_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_len = 0
    best_start = 0
    curr_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            len_block = i - curr_start
            if len_block > max_len:
                max_len = len_block
                best_start = curr_start
            curr_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_len - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This identifies the longest run of non-empty rows, which is core but subtly fails if multiple blocks exist or if zeros inside should be included—worked partially for block length but wrong start in examples.)

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row min/max non-zero columns; essential for tight cropping, but only applied to main block rows.)

```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, num_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = num_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l != -1:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
(Combines row bounds for overall column crop; helpful but may yield empty if all rows in block are zero, leading to [[0]] fallback.)

```python
def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row_slice = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row_slice)
    return cropped
```
(Core cropping function; works for slicing but inherits errors from bounds.)

```python
def pad_dimension(lst: List[List[int]], target_size: int, is_rows: bool) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not lst:
        return [[0]]
    current_size = len(lst) if is_rows else len(lst[0])
    if current_size >= target_size:
        return lst
    pad_size = target_size - current_size
    left_or_top = pad_size // 2
    right_or_bottom = pad_size - left_or_top
    if is_rows:
        empty = [0] * len(lst[0])
        for _ in range(left_or_top):
            lst.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(right_or_bottom):
            lst.append(empty[:])
    else:
        for r in range(len(lst)):
            lst[r] = [0] * left_or_top + lst[r] + [0] * right_or_bottom
    return lst
```
(Handles symmetric zero-padding for dimensions; useful and correct in isolation, but applied after faulty crop leads to misaligned content.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    size = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, False)  # pad columns
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, True)   # pad rows
    return cropped
```
(Overall squaring logic; helpful but order matters—padding columns first then rows ensures square, but if w > h initially, row padding adds to height correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the concept of finding a main non-zero block via row counts and cropping to bounding box, which works for isolating content in dense grids but fails on precise start/end (e.g., Train 1 generated starts crop too early, including extraneous left-shifted 3's in row 0 and mismatches like row 2 [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—shifted right by 1 and wrong values at ends; unknown why exact mismatch but likely min_c off by 1).
 * Train 2: Cropping works for row block but column bounds too narrow, omitting right-side elements (generated row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—missing two 3's on right, extra 3 on left); padding adds zeros incorrectly around incomplete crop.
 * Train 3: Block detection includes wrong rows, leading to row order flip or extra borders (generated row 0 [4,0,4,...] vs expected row 0 [0,4,0,...]—seems like it cropped starting from an offset row and didn't reverse or adjust for alternating pattern).
 * find_main_block is helpful but broken for cases with internal zero rows that should be included (it skips on any zero count row, potentially splitting blocks—e.g., if a structural zero row has count=0 but is part of the object, it's excluded).
 * get_row_bounds and compute_col_bounds are essential and mostly correct but fail when block has varying widths, leading to over-tight crops.
 * pad_dimension and pad_to_square are not broken and helpful for final output, but unhelpful if upstream crop is wrong (don't modify, but ensure crop inputs are accurate).
 * Overall, no extraction of "objects" like connected components was attempted, which might be needed if multiple disjoint parts exist (not in this code, but could be relevant for subtleties like ignoring outliers); current approach assumes single main block.
 * Train 1 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., generated row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—extra 3 and wrong positions, likely from faulty end_r or max_c).
 * No function for connected component analysis or object extraction, which might be unhelpful here since the puzzle seems bounding-box based, not segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped a central 5x13-ish pattern (rows ~3-9 with 3's,5's,4's) but padded excessively to 13x13 with large zero borders, shifting the content downward and not centering it properly (e.g., non-zeros start at row 3, but expected likely tighter crop to rows 4-8, columns ~3-10, padded to ~7x7 square embedded in zeros without the wide empty top/bottom). 
 * It includes symmetric 5's on left/right but mismatches internal structure (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] suggests incomplete column crop, missing connections like the 4 in row 6); this doesn't make sense as a clean extraction—likely wrong min_c/max_c (too wide on sides, too narrow vertically) and over-pads without preserving the "object" shape (e.g., the cross-like 3's and inner 4 seem distorted). 
 * To handle test case, account for multiple horizontal bars (top/bottom 5's, middle 3's) by ensuring block includes all connected non-zeros vertically, even if sparse; current code probably picks a partial block, leading to missing top/bottom elements.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid processing, where the goal is to identify the primary "object" or contiguous region of non-zero values in a 2D grid (likely representing an image or shape), crop it to its tight bounding box, and then pad the result to form a square grid while preserving the content. The output should be a transformed grid that isolates and normalizes the main feature for comparison or rendering.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of rows of integers (0 for empty/background, non-zero for filled/object pixels), and the "object" is defined by contiguous sequences of rows with non-zero counts, ignoring isolated or sparse rows.
 * Focus on the largest contiguous block of rows with any non-zeros to avoid including noise or separate components; subtle elements include handling rows with varying non-zero positions (e.g., irregular shapes) and ensuring column bounds are computed only over the selected rows.
 * Cropping must create a tight bounding box: min/max columns based on the first/last non-zero in each relevant row, but aggregated globally to avoid over-cropping jagged edges.
 * Padding to square should center the content (symmetric or near-symmetric padding with zeros) and handle cases where height and width differ, potentially starting from a 1x1 zero grid if empty.
 * Edge cases: empty grids, all-zero rows/columns, single-row/column objects, or grids where non-zeros don't align perfectly; avoid assuming uniform row lengths or non-negative values.
 * Non-zero values might represent different "colors" or intensities, but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding/cropping; preserve original values in the output.
 * Subtlety: Contiguous blocks reset on zero-count rows, so multiple objects might exist, but only the largest is selected—easy to miss if code doesn't properly scan for max length.
 * Global bounds must initialize correctly (e.g., min_col to infinity or grid width, max_col to -1) to handle rows with no non-zeros within the block.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is solid for row density; use it to identify active rows.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing; efficiently computes non-zero counts per row.)

```python
def find_largest_contiguous_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_length = 0
    best_start = 0
    current_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            length = i - current_start
            if length > max_length:
                max_length = length
                best_start = current_start
            current_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_length - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This correctly identifies the start/end of the largest run of non-zero-count rows; essential for isolating the main object vertically. Handles edge cases like all-zero grid returning (0,-1) or similar.)

```python
def get_row_first_last(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n  # Initialize to full width (beyond any valid index)
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row horizontal bounds; note initialization of first to n and last to -1 to handle all-zero rows gracefully, where (n, -1) indicates empty.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
(Reliable for extracting subgrid; assumes valid indices and handles empty slices.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    size = max(h, w)
    # Pad columns first if needed
    if w < size:
        pad_left = (size - w) // 2
        pad_right = size - w - pad_left
        for i in range(h):
            grid[i] = [0] * pad_left + grid[i] + [0] * pad_right
        w = size
    # Pad rows if needed
    if h < size:
        pad_top = (size - h) // 2
        pad_bottom = size - h - pad_top
        empty = [0] * size
        for _ in range(pad_top):
            grid.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(pad_bottom):
            grid.append(empty[:])
    return grid
```
(Effective for centering and squaring; handles empty grids and asymmetric padding well, preserving original values.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt demonstrates partial understanding of the puzzle by correctly identifying the need for contiguous row selection, per-row bounds, tight cropping, and square padding, but fails entirely due to a runtime error in all cases.
 * What worked: The vertical block detection (find_largest_contiguous_block) and per-row bounds (get_row_first_last) are logically sound and would isolate the main object if integrated properly; cropping and padding functions execute without issues in isolation.
 * What didn't work: The compute_global_bounds function is broken—it incorrectly initializes min_c as len(bounds[0][0]), where bounds[0][0] is an int (column index), causing "object of type 'int' has no len()" error on all inputs; this prevents any successful execution, so no outputs are generated for analysis.
 * No training examples or test passed; all resulted in the same execution error, indicating the bug blocks the entire pipeline.
 * The approach assumes the largest contiguous non-zero row block is the "object," which aligns with puzzle subtleties (e.g., ignoring noise), but untested due to crash.
 * Function compute_global_bounds is broken and unhelpful in its current form (causes crash; don't use without fixing initialization to something like min_c = float('inf') or grid width, and max_c = -1, then update only if l != -1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to the len() on int bug, so no actual grid is generated—completely incorrect and unusable for verification.
 * Expected test output should be a square-padded bounding box of the main contiguous object (e.g., if test input has a central shape spanning rows 2-5 and columns 3-7, output would crop to that 4x5 region, pad to 5x5 with zeros around, preserving non-zeros); the error prevents any match, and without seeing the input grid, it's unclear if the approach would otherwise align, but the crash confirms it does not produce a valid result.
 * This highlights the need to handle empty or edge rows in bounds aggregation without assuming non-empty tuples.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns (likely representing shapes, figures, or "objects" with pixel values like 3,5,6,8,4 indicating colors or types), where the goal is to extract the "main" or primary figure/object from the input grid, normalize its position (e.g., translate to top-left), compute a bounding box, and output a square grid representation padded with zeros, while ignoring or excluding noise, frames, or secondary elements. The output size is based on the max dimension of the extracted region, but the results suggest the extraction criteria (e.g., row selection, bounding box) are imprecise, leading to inclusions/exclusions of pixels that don't match expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain a "main" figure (dense cluster of non-zero pixels) surrounded by potential noise, frames, or disconnected elements (e.g., sparse lines or dots outside the core shape); the program must identify and isolate only the primary connected or consecutive component, excluding outer frames or isolated pixels.
 * Y-range selection is critical: use consecutive rows with non-zero sums, but prioritize the block with maximum total non-zero pixels to avoid noise; however, subtle disconnected parts (e.g., small protrusions or separate blobs) may need inclusion if part of the main structure, or exclusion if they are artifacts.
 * Bounding box computation must tightly fit the main figure's extent (min/max x/y of non-zeros in selected rows), but avoid expanding to include frame-like borders; translation shifts to (0,0) origin, and output is a square of side max(width, height) of the bbox, padded with zeros—do not return the original n x n size unless s == n.
 * Subtleties include handling asymmetric shapes (e.g., figures not centered), multiple potential "main" blocks (select largest by sum or area), and ensuring no pixel values are altered during extraction/translation—only positions change.
 * Noise handling: Grids may have zero-rows or sparse rows above/below/around the main figure; do not include them in the y-range or bbox unless they connect to the main structure.
 * Output must preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within the extracted region; mismatches often occur in top/bottom rows (e.g., extra 3s included as noise) or side alignments (e.g., shifted 8s or 6s).
 * Consider connected components: The main figure may not be fully rectangular; use row_bounds to find per-row min/max x, but aggregate carefully to avoid over-expansion.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return zero-filled n x n; if no main block, output zeros; varying grid sizes (10x10 or 13x13) mean s can be < n, leading to smaller outputs implicitly padded in display.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect y-range (including noise rows) or bbox (missing/extruding parts), resulting in shifted or incomplete figures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several modular functions for row analysis and extraction, which are partially useful for identifying and isolating regions but need refinement for accurate main figure selection (e.g., better y-range logic or component detection). No new types are defined, but Tuple[int, int] for bounds and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for pixels (y,x,value) are effective for handling positions and values.

The main `program` function composes these but is flawed in y-range/bbox selection; no explicit object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) is present, which might be needed for complex shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (all training examples failed); it correctly implements modular extraction/translation/padding but fails on core selection logic.
 * What worked: Pixel extraction preserves values; translation to (0,0) normalizes position; square padding handles varying bbox sizes; row_sums and row_bounds efficiently identify dense regions without full scans.
 * What didn't work: Y-range selection via max-sum consecutive rows includes noise (e.g., top/bottom sparse rows with 3s in train1), leading to bbox that captures extras; no handling for disconnected components or frames, causing over-inclusion; output size s often matches n but with misplaced pixels due to wrong min_y/max_y.
 * Train1: Generated includes extra 3s in row0 (positions 2,4) and row12 (3s at 3,4), but expected has 3s at 3 and 10 in row0, and 3s at 5 and 7 in row12; inner figure (8s,6s) is shifted/missing parts (e.g., generated row2 has 8s at 2-3 but expected at 3; row10 has 8s at 8-9 but expected at 9 missing); overall, figure is vertically expanded with noise, horizontally misaligned (unknown reason, possibly bbox min_x too low).
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 at 3 but expected all 0s except row1 3 at 6; row3 has 3s at 1-2 but expected 3 at 2; row4 has 5 at 0,3 at 2 but expected 5 at 0,3s at 1-2; row5 matches somewhat but row6 has 4s missing in expected positions; figure is incomplete/shifted rightward, with extra 3s in noise rows (e.g., row1), suggesting wrong y-range including top noise.
 * Train3: Generated row0/1 are [4,0,4,...]/[0,4,0,...] but expected swapped to [0,4,0,...]/[4,0,4,...], indicating possible rotation or frame misextraction; inner 1s/2s are misplaced (e.g., generated row2 has 1 at 5 but expected row2 all 0s except 1s at 3-4; row4 has 2s at 4-5 but expected row4 2s at 4-5 ok, but surrounding 1s wrong); frame is included but inverted, inner figure vertically shifted down by ~1 row (unknown reason, likely y-range starts too early).
 * Function `get_main_bbox` is helpful but broken when y-range is noisy (propagates errors); `find_main_y_range` is essential but insufficient (needs connectivity or size threshold); no unhelpful functions, but the composition in `program` assumes single main block—add component detection for multi-blob grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of normalization but misses subtle noise exclusion and precise component isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it extracts a partial figure (5s on sides, 3s/4s in middle) but places it starting from row1 (with row0 as [0s,3,3,0s] like noise or bottom fragment), repeats the pattern in rows1-2/4-5 but inverts or shifts (e.g., row2 has 3s at 4-8 but test input row? has different), adds isolated 3 in row6 middle, then pads with 7+ zero rows— this suggests wrong y-range (included top noise, excluded bottom?), incomplete bbox (missing left/right alignments, e.g., 5s at 0-1 and 11-12 but 3s not centered), and over-padding without centering. Expected likely a tight square of the central cross-like figure (3s horizontal, 4s vertical-ish, framed by 5s) translated to top-left without extras, possibly 7x7 or similar s<13, but output bloats to 13x13 with misplaced elements (e.g., duplicated rows 1/5 and 2/4 indicate loop error or wrong min_y). It fails to isolate the main "plus" shape, including apparent noise 3s, and doesn't match a clean normalized output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting the "main" visual object or pattern from a sparse grid by identifying the bounding box of non-zero cells across relevant rows (not necessarily strictly consecutive), cropping to that subgrid, and then centering it within a square grid via symmetric padding with zeros, preserving the relative structure and values of the original content. The goal is to isolate and normalize the core artwork or symbol while ignoring outer noise or framing, but ensuring no distortion of internal zeros or shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main object" may span rows that are not fully consecutive non-zero counts; isolated zero rows within the object's vertical extent must be included if they are part of the bounding structure (e.g., gaps in patterns like letters or symbols), so the row selection should use the overall min-max row bounds of non-zeros rather than the longest consecutive block.
 * Column cropping must use the tightest bounding box across the selected rows, but padding must be centered (symmetric left/right, top/bottom) to maintain visual alignment, and the target square size should be based on the max of the cropped height/width without over-trimming internal structure.
 * Subtle elements include preserving exact non-zero values (e.g., 3,8,6) and their positions, including internal zeros that define shapes (e.g., holes in blobs); over-cropping can merge or shift these, leading to mismatches.
 * Grids may have outer zero framing or noise (e.g., stray non-zeros), which should be excluded; the output is always square, but size varies based on content (e.g., 13x13 for Train1, 10x10 for Train2/3).
 * Handle empty or all-zero inputs by returning a minimal [[0]] or similar, but real cases have clear central patterns.
 * Padding must not introduce asymmetry; use integer division for even/odd splits to center properly.
 * Non-zero count per row helps identify active rows, but the block-finding logic fails when the object has vertical gaps (common in puzzles like ASCII art or pixel drawings).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements row non-zero counting, per-row bounds, subgrid cropping, and centered padding to square, which works for dense objects without gaps (e.g., partial credit for column alignment in some cases).
 * Failed to select the full vertical extent of the object by using longest consecutive non-zero row block, excluding necessary gapped zero rows (e.g., in Train1, cropped rows 1-11 excluding top/bottom framing, leading to shifted content and mismatched shapes like extra 3's in row 0 col 2 vs. expected zero).
 * In Train1, generated output includes incorrect values/positions (e.g., row 2 has [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] but expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...]; row 5 has [0,3,8,8,6,6,...] but expected [3,3,8,8,6,6,...]—unknown reason for vertical shift/misalignment, possibly from wrong start_r).
 * Train2 generated mismatches in internal structure (e.g., row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], adding extra 3's and shifting 4's; row 4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs. expected [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0], wrong blob connectivity).
 * Train3 generated flips or misaligns patterns (e.g., row 0 [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]; entire top/bottom borders swapped, and internal 1/2 placements off like row 2 [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4]).
 * find_longest_block function is broken for gapped objects (assumes consecutive density, misses full height); not helpful for this puzzle—replace with overall min/max row of any non-zero.
 * No object extraction beyond density; lacks function to find global min/max row/col of all non-zeros, which would fix row selection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped too narrowly vertically (content only in rows 3-8 of 13, with symmetric zero padding top/bottom, but likely excludes parts of a taller object with gaps, similar to Train failures).
 * It centers a sub-pattern (e.g., 3's and 5's forming a shape with 4's inside), but the full 13x13 suggests the object spans more rows (e.g., top/bottom 5's and 3's may connect via sparse rows), leading to potential misalignment if gapped rows like row 3/9 are omitted.
 * Horizontal cropping seems okay (tight around cols 3-10), but vertical misses full extent (e.g., if test has framing like Train1, output should include more zero-gapped rows for correct shape like a letter or symbol).
 * Padding to 13x13 is oversized if object is smaller, but makes sense if global bounds are used; however, the isolated central block ignores potential outer connections, making the output incomplete (e.g., top/bottom rows all zero except possibly stray, but expected likely has adjusted framing).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 14:43:07] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers (likely representing a visual image or diagram with different "colors" or elements via numbers like 3,8,6) to extract and isolate the main central "object" or figure by cropping to its tight bounding box and then padding with zeros to form a centered square grid of appropriate size. The goal is to remove extraneous border or empty space while preserving the structure of the core content, ensuring the output matches the expected cropped and padded form exactly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main object may not occupy every row or column fully, so cropping must use the minimal bounding box that encloses all non-zero elements of the object without including irrelevant outer zeros or disconnected elements.
 * Padding must be centered (symmetric where possible, with even/odd distribution) both horizontally and vertically to make the grid square, using the maximum of the cropped height and width as the target size.
 * Non-zero counts per row are useful for identifying dense regions, but the "max sum nonzero block" must consider the actual connected or primary object, not just any consecutive dense rows—subtleties include handling objects that span irregular rows (e.g., with sparse rows in between) or have protrusions that affect column bounds.
 * Column bounds should be computed only over the selected rows to avoid including distant non-zeros outside the main object.
 * The grid may have symmetric borders or frames (e.g., repeating patterns like 3's or 5's around the edges), which should be excluded if they are not part of the core figure.
 * Subtle elements: Objects can have internal zeros (holes or gaps) that should be preserved, but the bounding box ignores them for cropping; ensure no shearing, shifting, or alteration of values during crop/pad.
 * All non-zero elements in the output must match positions and values exactly from the input's main object; extraneous non-zeros (e.g., from borders) lead to mismatches.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids default to [[0]]; objects may not be rectangular, so tight bounds are key; padding adds zeros only outside the crop.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_count(row: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [row_nonzero_count(row) for row in g]
```
These are helpful for identifying dense rows to locate potential object regions.

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds

def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, n_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
These are partially helpful for computing per-row and aggregate column bounds to define the crop area accurately.

```python
def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped

def pad_columns(cropped: List[List[int]], target_width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_width = len(cropped[0])
    if current_width >= target_width:
        return cropped
    col_pad_left = (target_width - current_width) // 2
    col_pad_right = target_width - current_width - col_pad_left
    for r in range(len(cropped)):
        cropped[r] = [0] * col_pad_left + cropped[r] + [0] * col_pad_right
    return cropped

def pad_rows(cropped: List[List[int]], target_size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_height = len(cropped)
    if current_height >= target_size:
        return cropped
    row_pad_top = (target_size - current_height) // 2
    row_pad_bottom = target_size - current_height - row_pad_top
    size = len(cropped[0])
    for _ in range(row_pad_top):
        cropped.insert(0, [0] * size)
    for _ in range(row_pad_bottom):
        cropped.append([0] * size)
    return cropped

def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped or not cropped[0]:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    s = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_columns(cropped, s)
    cropped = pad_rows(cropped, s)
    return cropped
```
These cropping and padding functions are helpful and correctly implement tight bounding box extraction and centered square padding, but they depend on accurate row/column selection upstream.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements bounding box cropping and centered padding to square, which preserves internal structure and adds zeros appropriately, but fails because row selection via max consecutive nonzero sum includes extraneous rows (e.g., top/bottom borders with partial non-zeros).
 * In training example 1, generated includes extra top/bottom rows with misplaced 3's (e.g., generated row 0: [0,0,3,0,3,0,...] vs expected row 0: [0,0,0,3,0,0,...]) and shifts internal elements (e.g., row 2 generated [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]), likely due to wrong row start/end and column bounds including border artifacts; bottom row also mismatches (generated [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]).
 * In training example 2, generated crops too tightly or shifts columns, omitting some 3's and 4's (e.g., generated row 3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected row 3: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], missing right-side 3's and altering 5 positions); also includes top row non-zeros incorrectly while expected has more zeros there.
 * In training example 3, generated starts with wrong row order (e.g., generated row 0: [4,0,4,0,...] vs expected row 0: [0,4,0,4,...]), indicating failure to identify the correct starting row for the object, and internal mismatches like row 2 generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] show shifted or incomplete bounds.
 * The find_max_sum_nonzero_block function is broken/not helpful as it assumes consecutive dense rows define the object, but puzzles have non-consecutive or bordered elements, leading to over-inclusion; don't use it in future without refinement to detect the primary connected component.
 * Overall, the approach demonstrates partial understanding of cropping/padding but misses identifying the exact main object bounds, treating borders as part of the figure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 square with the main content (3's,5's,4's forming what seems like a figure or letter) centered in rows 4-8 and columns 4-8, but padded heavily with outer zeros, which may be too loose—likely the expected is a tighter crop to just the non-zero block (e.g., 5x5 or similar square without the large empty borders), as the current method includes empty rows/columns from the input's sparse layout, mismatching the training expectations where tighter, object-focused squares are produced without extraneous space.
 * It incorrectly assumes the entire input height needs full padding to 13x13, but the object appears confined to a smaller central area (rows ~3-8, cols ~3-9), so the output bloats the grid unnecessarily and may shift positions if bounds are off, similar to training failures.

[2025-10-03 14:43:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop a grid to focus on the "main" or central non-zero content (likely a symbol, digit, or pattern formed by numbers like 3, 5, 6, 8 representing filled pixels or segments), then pad it symmetrically with zeros to form a square grid of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, while preserving the relative positions and ensuring alignment matches the expected output. The process involves identifying contiguous rows with significant non-zero activity, computing tight column bounds within those rows, cropping, and centering via padding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping must use the tightest bounding box around the main object, but only for contiguous rows that form the core pattern—do not include isolated border rows or rows with minimal/sparse non-zeros if they are not part of the contiguous block, as this can shift the content left/right or include/exclude elements incorrectly.
 * Padding must be centered (even distribution on top/bottom and left/right), but the side length is the max of cropped height/width; however, if the input is already square-like, avoid over-padding or shifting the content asymmetrically.
 * Subtle element: The "main" row for starting the crop is the one with the highest non-zero count, but the contiguous block must extend only to rows where counts >0 without skipping zeros inside the object (but zeros inside are okay if part of the pattern); overlooking internal zero rows within the object can truncate it.
 * Grids may have border-like zeros or sparse rows (e.g., single non-zeros) that should be excluded from the crop to avoid including "frames" or artifacts, but the expected outputs sometimes retain specific sparse elements if they are integral to the pattern's edges.
 * Column bounds must be computed per the selected row range, but min/max columns should ignore empty rows within the range—easy to miss if bounds include padding from empty sub-rows.
 * Patterns involve numbers (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6/4/5 for fills), so treat all non-zero as "filled" for counting/bounds, but preserve exact values in output.
 * Inputs are rectangular lists of lists, outputs must be square and exactly match expected row-by-row, including zero placements.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return [[0]]; sparse patterns may require manual adjustment if auto-contiguous misses disconnected but related parts (though examples suggest patterns are contiguous).
 * From attempts: Row extension (start/end) works for dense centers but fails if the max-count row is not perfectly centered in the object, leading to asymmetric crops; padding functions are correct but applied after wrong crop, causing shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_count(row: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [row_nonzero_count(row) for row in g]

def find_max_count_row(counts: List[int]) -> int:
    if not counts:
        return 0
    max_i = 0
    max_c = counts[0]
    for i in range(1, len(counts)):
        if counts[i] > max_c:
            max_c = counts[i]
            max_i = i
    return max_i

def find_start_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    s = start
    while s > 0 and counts[s - 1] > 0:
        s -= 1
    return s

def find_end_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    e = start
    n = len(counts)
    while e < n - 1 and counts[e + 1] > 0:
        e += 1
    return e
```
These are helpful for identifying the core row range based on non-zero density.

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds

def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, n_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c

def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
These are useful for per-row and aggregate bounds, and basic cropping; they correctly compute min/max but fail if row range is wrong.

```python
def pad_columns(cropped: List[List[int]], target_width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_width = len(cropped[0])
    if current_width >= target_width:
        return cropped
    col_pad_left = (target_width - current_width) // 2
    col_pad_right = target_width - current_width - col_pad_left
    for r in range(len(cropped)):
        cropped[r] = [0] * col_pad_left + cropped[r] + [0] * col_pad_right
    return cropped

def pad_rows(cropped: List[List[int]], target_size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_height = len(cropped)
    if current_height >= target_size:
        return cropped
    row_pad_top = (target_size - current_height) // 2
    row_pad_bottom = target_size - current_height - row_pad_top
    size = len(cropped[0])
    for _ in range(row_pad_top):
        cropped.insert(0, [0] * size)
    for _ in range(row_pad_bottom):
        cropped.append([0] * size)
    return cropped
```
These handle symmetric padding well and are not broken—use them after fixing crop.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the max non-zero row and extends to contiguous non-zero rows, which works for dense central patterns but fails when the object has internal zero-count rows or when sparse edge rows (e.g., borders) should be excluded, leading to over-inclusion of empty space.
 * Cropping via row/column bounds is mostly right but computes min/max too broadly within the row range, including outliers from sparse rows, causing left-shifted content (e.g., in Train 1, generated row 0 has 3's at positions 2 and 4, but expected at 3 and 10, indicating wrong column start).
 * Padding to square is correct in logic (centered, max(h,w) side), but since crop is wrong, the final grid has shifted/misaligned patterns—e.g., Train 1 generated includes extra left zeros and wrong placements in rows 2-10 compared to expected (e.g., generated row 2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...], missing leading zeros and altering 3/8 positions).
 * Train 2 mismatches in row 1 (generated [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0], wrong 3 position) and row 3 (generated [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], extra 3's and shifted), suggesting column bounds grabbed too wide or wrong row range excluded top sparse rows.
 * Train 3 mismatches entirely in row ordering and content—generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips even/odd rows ([0,4,0,...] first), indicating the contiguous row finder or crop ignored the alternating border pattern, treating it as non-contiguous or wrong start row.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond bounds; a function to detect connected components (e.g., flood-fill for blobs) might help if patterns have disconnected parts, but current attempt lacks this—consider adding for future if contiguity fails.
 * The overall program(g) handles empty cases well but defaults to full grid crop if bounds fail, which over-pads without centering the true object.
 * Function `program` integrates everything but is broken due to row range logic—don't reuse without fixing start/end finders to skip zero-count rows outside the main block.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to crop/pad the entire input grid (13x13) with minimal trimming, resulting in large zero borders (e.g., rows 0-2 and 9-12 all zeros, content squeezed in rows 3-8 but shifted right with uneven columns, like 5's at edges but 3/4 patterns not centered). 
 * Compared to mentally running rules: The test input has a central cross-like pattern with 5's on sides, 3's in middle rows/columns, and a 4 in row 6 col 6; correct output should crop tightly to rows ~3-8 (height 6), columns ~3-9 (width 7, side=7), pad to 7x7 centered (e.g., add 0.5 rows top/bottom, 0 left/1 right), preserving exact 3/4/5 positions without the full 13x13 bloat or left/right shifts seen in generated (e.g., generated row 4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] includes outer 5's but expected would trim them if borders, centering the inner 3's and single 4).
 * It makes sense as a failed full-grid pad but not as correct extraction—missing tight crop leads to oversized zeros, and content alignment (e.g., 5's too far left in generated row 4) doesn't match a centered pattern; unknown why it didn't trim columns better, but likely because col_bounds took min_c=0 from edge 5's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely pixel art or ASCII-like representations with numbers as colors/values) where the goal is to extract or crop the "main object" or central content from a larger grid that includes borders, frames, or extraneous zero-padded areas. The extraction should produce a subgrid that matches the expected "clean" or bounded version of the object, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while trimming surrounding zeros appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid always has fixed dimensions (e.g., 20 columns in example 1, 10 in others), but the main object does not span the full width or height; borders often consist of patterned zeros or repeating non-zeros (e.g., 3's or 5's forming frames).
 * Non-zero rows are not always fully consecutive; there may be isolated zero rows at the top/bottom that should be excluded, but the "longest block" approach misses cases where the object has internal zero rows or irregular shapes.
 * Column cropping must account for the tightest bounding box per row group, but min/max columns are calculated per row in the block—subtleties include asymmetric objects where left/right edges vary, and zeros within the object should be preserved (not trimmed internally).
 * Objects may have "legs" or extensions (e.g., in example 1, the bottom row has sparse 3's that differ in generated vs. expected), requiring per-row min/max rather than global for the block.
 * All examples show symmetric or framed structures (e.g., 5's as borders in example 2, 4's in example 3), so extraction should ignore outer frames and focus on inner content; however, frames may integrate with the object (e.g., 3's in example 1 seem part of the object).
 * Expected outputs preserve some leading/trailing zeros within rows to maintain shape (e.g., example 1 expected has [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] vs. generated [0,0,3,0,3,...]), indicating no global left-trimming—crop to the union of all non-zero positions across the relevant rows.
 * Subtle element: The "object" may span nearly all rows but exclude thin top/bottom zero rows; in example 3, the object is rotated or checkerboard-patterned, and extraction flips or reorders rows/columns incorrectly.
 * Consider connectivity: Non-zeros may form disconnected blobs, but examples suggest extracting the primary connected component (e.g., ignore small isolated elements).
 * Height of extracted grid varies (13 rows in example 1, 10 in others), so dynamically determine start/end rows based on first/last non-all-zero rows, not just longest block.
 * Numbers represent colors/types (e.g., 3=one type, 8=another), so preserve exact values; zeros are background.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a longest consecutive non-zero row block to determine height, which worked partially for examples 1 and 2 (captured most rows) but failed in example 3 by including extra patterned rows (e.g., generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected starts with [0,4,0,...], indicating wrong row order or selection).
 * Global min/max column calculation worked for rough width in example 1 (13 cols output) but produced incorrect content: e.g., train 1 generated first row [0,0,3,0,3,0,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...], missing a leading zero and including an extra 3 early—likely due to min_c=1 instead of 3, shifting the slice left.
 * In train 2, generated included extraneous elements like [0,3,3,0,4,...] in row 4 vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], showing the uniform slice didn't align with the inner object's varying left edges (e.g., expected has more leading zeros in some rows).
 * Train 3 generated a near-full grid but mismatched row order and content: e.g., first row [4,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,...], and internal rows like generated [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—suggests the block finder took wrong start/end, and column slicing ignored the checkerboard symmetry.
 * The has_non_zero function is solid and essential for row detection.
 * find_longest_block is partially helpful but broken for gapped or framed objects (e.g., misses that example 3 has alternating non-zero rows throughout).
 * find_min_col and find_max_col are flawed—not helpful as-is, since they compute global bounds but objects need per-row trimming or union bounds that preserve internal spacing; using them leads to shifted or squished outputs.
 * Overall program demonstrates basic bounding box understanding but ignores frame detection and per-row variation, causing all mismatches; no object extraction beyond crude cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same flawed longest-block + global min/max column slicing, producing 7 rows of width 13, but the content shows irregular 5's and 3's that seem like a partial frame or object (e.g., first row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,...] suggests top border, but middle rows like [5,5,0,3,3,3,...] include outer 5's that may be frame elements to exclude).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: e.g., symmetric 5-borders in rows 2,4,6 suggest the output included frame instead of cropping to inner 3/4 content; the sparse bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,...] looks like it trimmed too much vertically, missing potential object extensions.
 * The output has varying non-zero positions (e.g., 3's clustered in cols 5-9, 5's on edges), indicating the global slice shifted everything left (min_c too low), distorting the shape—likely incorrect as it doesn't preserve the "clean" inner object seen in training expecteds.
 * No way to confirm exact expected without rules, but it fails to handle frame-like 5's (similar to train 2's borders), so probably needs frame detection or better row selection to exclude top/bottom zeros properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving sparse grids of integers (likely representing colored cells or patterns), where the goal is to extract a cropped subgrid that captures the "main" figure or object while removing extraneous empty (zero) borders or padding, resulting in a tighter, possibly rectangular bounding area around the non-zero content. The extraction should preserve the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but trim outer empty rows/columns to focus on the core pattern, without forcing a square shape or including unnecessary whitespace.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids are often large (e.g., 18x18 or 19x19) with significant empty (zero) areas on the borders, especially left/right columns and top/bottom rows; the output must crop these dynamically to the minimal or near-minimal bounding rectangle enclosing all non-zero cells, but not so aggressively that internal zeros (part of the pattern) are removed.
 * Outputs are rectangular, not necessarily square—e.g., training example 1 expects 13x13 but with irregular non-zero distribution; forcing square shapes (as in the current program) leads to oversized or misaligned extractions that include padding.
 * Non-zero cells form connected or semi-connected "objects" (e.g., borders, shapes like 3's, 8's, 6's in train1; 5's, 3's, 4's in train2; 4's and inner patterns in train3), and the extraction should encompass the largest or primary object without fragmenting it or including disconnected outliers.
 * Internal zeros within the pattern must be preserved (e.g., gaps in shapes), but outer pure-zero rows/columns should be trimmed; subtle elements include asymmetric padding (more empty on left in train1) and potential for multiple disjoint objects (e.g., small isolated cells in test input like bottom-right 5's).
 * The puzzle may involve identifying a "frame" or border (e.g., alternating 4's in train3) as part of the core pattern, so cropping shouldn't remove structural edges unless they are fully empty.
 * Grids can have varying sizes, so the program must compute bounds dynamically rather than hardcoding; consider row/column spans of non-zeros, but account for cases where the "main" object doesn't span the full height/width (e.g., train2 has empty middle rows in output? No, output includes them if part of bounds).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs can have leading/trailing zeros in rows if they are part of the pattern's edge (e.g., train1 row1 starts/ends with zeros), but entire rows/columns of zeros on the perimeter should be omitted; also, rotation or reordering (seen in train3 mismatch) isn't needed—extraction is positional cropping.
 * Across attempts (only one shown, but implied iterations): Prioritize bounding box over density; handle varying grid sizes without assuming square; avoid maximizing non-zeros in a square, as it grabs too-wide areas with padding (e.g., train1 includes 5+ left zeros per row).

    return [[g[i][j] for j in range(start_col, end_col)] for i in range(start_row, end_row)]
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `find_largest_square_block`: Broken for this puzzle—forces square (w == h) and maximizes non-zero count within it, leading to padded or oversized extractions (e.g., grabs full-width with left zeros in train1); ignores rectangular bounds and includes empty rows/columns; not relevant, as puzzle outputs aren't strictly square.
 * Current `program`: Relies on square finder, so always fails on asymmetric patterns; extracts too much padding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown uses a square-focused approach, which worked partially by identifying dense non-zero areas (e.g., captured most of the 3/8/6 patterns in train1) but failed by including excessive left/top/bottom padding zeros, resulting in oversized/wider outputs (18 cols vs. expected 13 in train1; 15 vs. 10 in train2).
 * Train1: Generated a near-full grid with 5+ leading zeros per row and extra bottom empty rows, mismatching expected cropped version (starts trimming at col 3, ends at col 15-ish, removes left empty block); unknown why it picked h=11 starting at row 0, but it over-included empties; nz maximization grabbed too-wide span (min_c=6, w=11? but still padded).
 * Train2: Generated included extra left/right empties and mismatched row lengths (15 vs. 10), capturing 5/3/4 patterns but with padding (e.g., leading zeros in rows); failed to crop tightly around the central object, adding irrelevant empty rows at bottom.
 * Train3: Generated almost the full 10x10 but with rows 1-2 swapped and inner pattern misaligned (e.g., row3 has [4,0,0,0,0,1,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,...]), suggesting wrong start/min_col (perhaps picked h=10, s=0, min_c=0 including border but shifting?); close in size but positionally wrong, missing subtle inner crop.
 * extract_subgrid is mostly helpful but limited to square (h-wide); get_nonzero_cols_per_row is essential for span detection but underused (only for min/max col, not full bounds).
 * Overall: Missed rectangular cropping; considered density over bounds; no handling for asymmetric empties; train samples all failed due to padding inclusion; function forcing square is incorrect (don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it extracts a very wide (19 cols?) rectangular strip starting from the left, including massive empty padding (e.g., rows 1-5 have 3-18 leading zeros before any non-zero like 5 or 3), and captures disjoint elements (top-left 3's, mid-right 5's block, bottom 3/4/5 patterns) without tight cropping, resulting in a sparse, non-focused grid that doesn't isolate a "main" figure.
 * It mismatches what a correct output should be: mentally, the test input has a small top-left 3/5 cluster (rows 0-4, cols 0-3), a mid-right 5's block (rows 6-8, cols 11-14), a large bottom-center 3/4/5 object (rows 10-14, cols 6-17), and scattered bottom 5's (rows 17-18); a correct extraction likely needs to bound the largest/dominant object (bottom 3/4/5, ~5x12), cropping to ~ rows 10-15, cols 6-18, yielding a tighter 6x13 with preserved internals, not the full padded mess; current output includes irrelevant top empties and doesn't focus, making it look like a raw dump rather than a puzzle solution.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of numbers (likely representing pixel-like patterns or objects with different values like 3,5,8,4,6,1,2 indicating colors, shapes, or densities), where the goal is to automatically detect, extract, and isolate the "main" or central patterned object(s) by cropping to their bounding box and padding to a square grid, while removing extraneous empty space, noise, or secondary elements. The output must match the expected clean, centered square representations exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements within the object.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids contain multiple potential "objects" or patterns (e.g., scattered numbers like 3's forming borders, 8's in shapes, 5's in lines), but only the primary cohesive one(s) should be extracted—secondary or isolated elements (e.g., lone 8's at the bottom in training example 1, or small 3's/4's in example 2) must be omitted to avoid bloating the output.
 * Extraction involves identifying a contiguous block of rows and columns that tightly bounds the main object, not just the densest rows via sum of non-zeros; subtle connections (e.g., via adjacent non-zeros) or visual coherence (e.g., forming a recognizable shape like a figure or symbol) should guide selection, as pure density (Kadane's) misses vertically sparse but connected parts.
 * Padding must center the cropped object in a square of size equal to the max dimension of the crop, using zeros; however, over-padding or including empty rows/columns leads to mismatched sizes (e.g., generated outputs often have 19x19 with excessive zeros, while expected are smaller like 13x13 or 10x10).
 * Non-zero values must be preserved exactly (no alteration), and the output grid must be rectangular lists of lists, but represented as square after padding; subtle elements include handling irregular shapes where first/last non-zero columns vary per row, requiring global min/max bounds per block, but avoiding blocks that include disconnected noise.
 * Grids may have varying sizes (e.g., 19x19 in example 1, 17x17 in example 2), with empty borders or padding already present; extraction should ignore outer zeros but detect if the main object spans most of the grid or is offset.
 * Connected components (e.g., 4-connected or 8-connected non-zeros) might be key to identify "objects" rather than row sums, as current method grabs loose contiguous rows including gaps.
 * Edge cases: All-zero grids return [[0]]; single-object grids need tight crop; multiple objects require selecting the largest/coherent one (e.g., in example 3, ignore top scattered 1's and 4's, focus on central patterned block).
 * Outputs are shown as flattened rows but are 2D lists; mismatches often in size (too big) or content (extra zeros/noise included).

    # ... (code as provided, but flawed logic for if counts[i] > max_current + counts[i], which is always true if counts[i] > 0; buggy comparison)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by selecting overly broad row blocks via flawed Kadane's on row non-zero sums, leading to inclusion of empty or sparse rows (e.g., in training 1, generated a 19x19 with bottom empty rows and side zeros, while expected is 13x13 tight crop of central 3/8/6 pattern; difference: extra padding and missed tight row 2-12 crop, omitting bottom 8's correctly but bloating size).
 * In training 2, generated scattered 5/3/4 elements across a large zero-padded grid, including isolated top/bottom parts, while expected is 10x10 tight extraction of central 5/3/4 shape; difference: wrong row selection (e.g., included row 2 with single 5, but expected starts from denser block), resulting in disconnected output.
 * In training 3, generated a mess with top scattered 1's/4's and bottom empty, missing the central 4/1/2 pattern; expected 10x10 vertical crop/pad of rows ~10-18; difference: selected wrong block (rows 2-3 and 9-18 loosely), ignoring main object's vertical span.
 * Cropping and padding functions worked technically (produced square outputs), but fed bad inputs, so outputs mismatched in content (extra zeros, wrong elements) and size.
 * No connected component analysis, so missed subtle object cohesion (e.g., 8-connected non-zeros for shapes); density sum overlooked vertical/horizontal sparsity in main objects.
 * Bug in Kadane's: The condition `if counts[i] > max_current + counts[i]` simplifies to `0 > max_current`, which is rarely true, causing incorrect start/end indices (e.g., often picks single high-density rows or full grid).
 * extract_objects not present, but would be essential—current approach lacks object detection, treating rows independently.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a large ~19x19 grid with scattered 5's, 3's, and 4's in disconnected patches (e.g., isolated 5's in rows 1-5 and 7-8, then a partial 3/4/5 shape in rows 11-15, plus bottom 5's), heavily zero-padded, resembling noise rather than a cohesive object. This mismatches what a correct extraction should be: likely a tight square crop of the central-right 3/4/5 pattern (rows ~11-15, columns ~7-18 or similar, forming a shape like in training 2), padded to ~9x9 or 10x10, omitting top-left 3's/5's and bottom 5's as secondary. The output includes extraneous elements (e.g., top 3's in row 3, lone 4 in row 2) and excessive empty space, indicating the row block selection grabbed too much (probably rows 0-18 via poor density), failing to isolate the main clustered object around the 3/4/5 block.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

    # Generally correct for centering, but can produce oversized/off-center results if crop is wrong (e.g., 13x13 with uneven pads).
```
The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with different "colors" or values like 3,6,8) to extract the central or main non-zero content, crop it to a tight bounding box, and pad it symmetrically to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main block" should be identified as the longest consecutive sequence of rows with any non-zero elements, but care must be taken to exclude leading/trailing fully zero rows without including isolated zero rows within the block if they are structurally important (e.g., in example 1, internal zero positions are preserved but the block start/end must align precisely with the expected cropped area).
 * Column bounds must be computed only over the main row block, finding the minimal and maximal non-zero columns across those rows, but without expanding beyond the actual content—subtly, if a row in the block has no non-zeros (but is included in the block due to adjacency), its bounds should not affect min/max (current compute_col_bounds skips if l==-1, which is good, but may still misalign if block includes empty rows incorrectly).
 * Padding to square must be symmetric (centering the content) using zeros, first padding columns to match height, then rows to match the new width, but the target size is max(h,w) after cropping—issue is that if cropping misses parts, padding adds extra zeros in wrong places (e.g., in example 1, generated adds unintended non-zeros or shifts content left/right).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes with borders of zeros; the output should be square but retain the exact relative positions of non-zeros from the cropped area (e.g., example 2 shows misalignment in rows 3-4 where generated has [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] but expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], indicating column crop is too narrow or shifted).
 * Subtle element: Non-zeros represent "pixels" of different types (e.g., 3 might be borders, 6/8 fills), and the puzzle likely requires exact reproduction without altering values or introducing new ones—easy to miss that bounding box must be inclusive of all edge non-zeros but exclusive of outer empty space.
 * In example 3, the pattern alternates rows/columns, and generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips the starting row order, suggesting possible row reversal or reordering not handled (or wrong block detection includes extra).
 * General: Handle empty or all-zero grids by returning [[0]]; assume rectangular input; outputs are lists of lists, printed as rows.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), consider that main block detection uses row non-zero counts correctly but may over-include if zero rows are adjacent (e.g., example 1 generated includes row 0 with partial non-zeros? Wait, generated row 0 [0,0,3,0,3,...] suggests crop started too early or wrong min_c).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(x != 0 for x in row)
```
(This is useful for identifying dense rows.)

```python
def get_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing row densities to find blocks.)

```python
def find_main_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_len = 0
    best_start = 0
    curr_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            len_block = i - curr_start
            if len_block > max_len:
                max_len = len_block
                best_start = curr_start
            curr_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_len - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This identifies the longest run of non-empty rows, which is core but subtly fails if multiple blocks exist or if zeros inside should be included—worked partially for block length but wrong start in examples.)

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row min/max non-zero columns; essential for tight cropping, but only applied to main block rows.)

```python
def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, num_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = num_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l != -1:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
(Combines row bounds for overall column crop; helpful but may yield empty if all rows in block are zero, leading to [[0]] fallback.)

```python
def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row_slice = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row_slice)
    return cropped
```
(Core cropping function; works for slicing but inherits errors from bounds.)

```python
def pad_dimension(lst: List[List[int]], target_size: int, is_rows: bool) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not lst:
        return [[0]]
    current_size = len(lst) if is_rows else len(lst[0])
    if current_size >= target_size:
        return lst
    pad_size = target_size - current_size
    left_or_top = pad_size // 2
    right_or_bottom = pad_size - left_or_top
    if is_rows:
        empty = [0] * len(lst[0])
        for _ in range(left_or_top):
            lst.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(right_or_bottom):
            lst.append(empty[:])
    else:
        for r in range(len(lst)):
            lst[r] = [0] * left_or_top + lst[r] + [0] * right_or_bottom
    return lst
```
(Handles symmetric zero-padding for dimensions; useful and correct in isolation, but applied after faulty crop leads to misaligned content.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    size = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, False)  # pad columns
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, True)   # pad rows
    return cropped
```
(Overall squaring logic; helpful but order matters—padding columns first then rows ensures square, but if w > h initially, row padding adds to height correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the concept of finding a main non-zero block via row counts and cropping to bounding box, which works for isolating content in dense grids but fails on precise start/end (e.g., Train 1 generated starts crop too early, including extraneous left-shifted 3's in row 0 and mismatches like row 2 [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—shifted right by 1 and wrong values at ends; unknown why exact mismatch but likely min_c off by 1).
 * Train 2: Cropping works for row block but column bounds too narrow, omitting right-side elements (generated row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—missing two 3's on right, extra 3 on left); padding adds zeros incorrectly around incomplete crop.
 * Train 3: Block detection includes wrong rows, leading to row order flip or extra borders (generated row 0 [4,0,4,...] vs expected row 0 [0,4,0,...]—seems like it cropped starting from an offset row and didn't reverse or adjust for alternating pattern).
 * find_main_block is helpful but broken for cases with internal zero rows that should be included (it skips on any zero count row, potentially splitting blocks—e.g., if a structural zero row has count=0 but is part of the object, it's excluded).
 * get_row_bounds and compute_col_bounds are essential and mostly correct but fail when block has varying widths, leading to over-tight crops.
 * pad_dimension and pad_to_square are not broken and helpful for final output, but unhelpful if upstream crop is wrong (don't modify, but ensure crop inputs are accurate).
 * Overall, no extraction of "objects" like connected components was attempted, which might be needed if multiple disjoint parts exist (not in this code, but could be relevant for subtleties like ignoring outliers); current approach assumes single main block.
 * Train 1 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., generated row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—extra 3 and wrong positions, likely from faulty end_r or max_c).
 * No function for connected component analysis or object extraction, which might be unhelpful here since the puzzle seems bounding-box based, not segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped a central 5x13-ish pattern (rows ~3-9 with 3's,5's,4's) but padded excessively to 13x13 with large zero borders, shifting the content downward and not centering it properly (e.g., non-zeros start at row 3, but expected likely tighter crop to rows 4-8, columns ~3-10, padded to ~7x7 square embedded in zeros without the wide empty top/bottom). 
 * It includes symmetric 5's on left/right but mismatches internal structure (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] suggests incomplete column crop, missing connections like the 4 in row 6); this doesn't make sense as a clean extraction—likely wrong min_c/max_c (too wide on sides, too narrow vertically) and over-pads without preserving the "object" shape (e.g., the cross-like 3's and inner 4 seem distorted). 
 * To handle test case, account for multiple horizontal bars (top/bottom 5's, middle 3's) by ensuring block includes all connected non-zeros vertically, even if sparse; current code probably picks a partial block, leading to missing top/bottom elements.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid processing, where the goal is to identify the primary "object" or contiguous region of non-zero values in a 2D grid (likely representing an image or shape), crop it to its tight bounding box, and then pad the result to form a square grid while preserving the content. The output should be a transformed grid that isolates and normalizes the main feature for comparison or rendering.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of rows of integers (0 for empty/background, non-zero for filled/object pixels), and the "object" is defined by contiguous sequences of rows with non-zero counts, ignoring isolated or sparse rows.
 * Focus on the largest contiguous block of rows with any non-zeros to avoid including noise or separate components; subtle elements include handling rows with varying non-zero positions (e.g., irregular shapes) and ensuring column bounds are computed only over the selected rows.
 * Cropping must create a tight bounding box: min/max columns based on the first/last non-zero in each relevant row, but aggregated globally to avoid over-cropping jagged edges.
 * Padding to square should center the content (symmetric or near-symmetric padding with zeros) and handle cases where height and width differ, potentially starting from a 1x1 zero grid if empty.
 * Edge cases: empty grids, all-zero rows/columns, single-row/column objects, or grids where non-zeros don't align perfectly; avoid assuming uniform row lengths or non-negative values.
 * Non-zero values might represent different "colors" or intensities, but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding/cropping; preserve original values in the output.
 * Subtlety: Contiguous blocks reset on zero-count rows, so multiple objects might exist, but only the largest is selected—easy to miss if code doesn't properly scan for max length.
 * Global bounds must initialize correctly (e.g., min_col to infinity or grid width, max_col to -1) to handle rows with no non-zeros within the block.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is solid for row density; use it to identify active rows.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing; efficiently computes non-zero counts per row.)

```python
def find_largest_contiguous_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_length = 0
    best_start = 0
    current_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            length = i - current_start
            if length > max_length:
                max_length = length
                best_start = current_start
            current_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_length - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This correctly identifies the start/end of the largest run of non-zero-count rows; essential for isolating the main object vertically. Handles edge cases like all-zero grid returning (0,-1) or similar.)

```python
def get_row_first_last(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n  # Initialize to full width (beyond any valid index)
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row horizontal bounds; note initialization of first to n and last to -1 to handle all-zero rows gracefully, where (n, -1) indicates empty.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
(Reliable for extracting subgrid; assumes valid indices and handles empty slices.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    size = max(h, w)
    # Pad columns first if needed
    if w < size:
        pad_left = (size - w) // 2
        pad_right = size - w - pad_left
        for i in range(h):
            grid[i] = [0] * pad_left + grid[i] + [0] * pad_right
        w = size
    # Pad rows if needed
    if h < size:
        pad_top = (size - h) // 2
        pad_bottom = size - h - pad_top
        empty = [0] * size
        for _ in range(pad_top):
            grid.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(pad_bottom):
            grid.append(empty[:])
    return grid
```
(Effective for centering and squaring; handles empty grids and asymmetric padding well, preserving original values.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt demonstrates partial understanding of the puzzle by correctly identifying the need for contiguous row selection, per-row bounds, tight cropping, and square padding, but fails entirely due to a runtime error in all cases.
 * What worked: The vertical block detection (find_largest_contiguous_block) and per-row bounds (get_row_first_last) are logically sound and would isolate the main object if integrated properly; cropping and padding functions execute without issues in isolation.
 * What didn't work: The compute_global_bounds function is broken—it incorrectly initializes min_c as len(bounds[0][0]), where bounds[0][0] is an int (column index), causing "object of type 'int' has no len()" error on all inputs; this prevents any successful execution, so no outputs are generated for analysis.
 * No training examples or test passed; all resulted in the same execution error, indicating the bug blocks the entire pipeline.
 * The approach assumes the largest contiguous non-zero row block is the "object," which aligns with puzzle subtleties (e.g., ignoring noise), but untested due to crash.
 * Function compute_global_bounds is broken and unhelpful in its current form (causes crash; don't use without fixing initialization to something like min_c = float('inf') or grid width, and max_c = -1, then update only if l != -1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to the len() on int bug, so no actual grid is generated—completely incorrect and unusable for verification.
 * Expected test output should be a square-padded bounding box of the main contiguous object (e.g., if test input has a central shape spanning rows 2-5 and columns 3-7, output would crop to that 4x5 region, pad to 5x5 with zeros around, preserving non-zeros); the error prevents any match, and without seeing the input grid, it's unclear if the approach would otherwise align, but the crash confirms it does not produce a valid result.
 * This highlights the need to handle empty or edge rows in bounds aggregation without assuming non-empty tuples.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns (likely representing shapes, figures, or "objects" with pixel values like 3,5,6,8,4 indicating colors or types), where the goal is to extract the "main" or primary figure/object from the input grid, normalize its position (e.g., translate to top-left), compute a bounding box, and output a square grid representation padded with zeros, while ignoring or excluding noise, frames, or secondary elements. The output size is based on the max dimension of the extracted region, but the results suggest the extraction criteria (e.g., row selection, bounding box) are imprecise, leading to inclusions/exclusions of pixels that don't match expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain a "main" figure (dense cluster of non-zero pixels) surrounded by potential noise, frames, or disconnected elements (e.g., sparse lines or dots outside the core shape); the program must identify and isolate only the primary connected or consecutive component, excluding outer frames or isolated pixels.
 * Y-range selection is critical: use consecutive rows with non-zero sums, but prioritize the block with maximum total non-zero pixels to avoid noise; however, subtle disconnected parts (e.g., small protrusions or separate blobs) may need inclusion if part of the main structure, or exclusion if they are artifacts.
 * Bounding box computation must tightly fit the main figure's extent (min/max x/y of non-zeros in selected rows), but avoid expanding to include frame-like borders; translation shifts to (0,0) origin, and output is a square of side max(width, height) of the bbox, padded with zeros—do not return the original n x n size unless s == n.
 * Subtleties include handling asymmetric shapes (e.g., figures not centered), multiple potential "main" blocks (select largest by sum or area), and ensuring no pixel values are altered during extraction/translation—only positions change.
 * Noise handling: Grids may have zero-rows or sparse rows above/below/around the main figure; do not include them in the y-range or bbox unless they connect to the main structure.
 * Output must preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within the extracted region; mismatches often occur in top/bottom rows (e.g., extra 3s included as noise) or side alignments (e.g., shifted 8s or 6s).
 * Consider connected components: The main figure may not be fully rectangular; use row_bounds to find per-row min/max x, but aggregate carefully to avoid over-expansion.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return zero-filled n x n; if no main block, output zeros; varying grid sizes (10x10 or 13x13) mean s can be < n, leading to smaller outputs implicitly padded in display.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect y-range (including noise rows) or bbox (missing/extruding parts), resulting in shifted or incomplete figures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several modular functions for row analysis and extraction, which are partially useful for identifying and isolating regions but need refinement for accurate main figure selection (e.g., better y-range logic or component detection). No new types are defined, but Tuple[int, int] for bounds and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for pixels (y,x,value) are effective for handling positions and values.

The main `program` function composes these but is flawed in y-range/bbox selection; no explicit object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) is present, which might be needed for complex shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (all training examples failed); it correctly implements modular extraction/translation/padding but fails on core selection logic.
 * What worked: Pixel extraction preserves values; translation to (0,0) normalizes position; square padding handles varying bbox sizes; row_sums and row_bounds efficiently identify dense regions without full scans.
 * What didn't work: Y-range selection via max-sum consecutive rows includes noise (e.g., top/bottom sparse rows with 3s in train1), leading to bbox that captures extras; no handling for disconnected components or frames, causing over-inclusion; output size s often matches n but with misplaced pixels due to wrong min_y/max_y.
 * Train1: Generated includes extra 3s in row0 (positions 2,4) and row12 (3s at 3,4), but expected has 3s at 3 and 10 in row0, and 3s at 5 and 7 in row12; inner figure (8s,6s) is shifted/missing parts (e.g., generated row2 has 8s at 2-3 but expected at 3; row10 has 8s at 8-9 but expected at 9 missing); overall, figure is vertically expanded with noise, horizontally misaligned (unknown reason, possibly bbox min_x too low).
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 at 3 but expected all 0s except row1 3 at 6; row3 has 3s at 1-2 but expected 3 at 2; row4 has 5 at 0,3 at 2 but expected 5 at 0,3s at 1-2; row5 matches somewhat but row6 has 4s missing in expected positions; figure is incomplete/shifted rightward, with extra 3s in noise rows (e.g., row1), suggesting wrong y-range including top noise.
 * Train3: Generated row0/1 are [4,0,4,...]/[0,4,0,...] but expected swapped to [0,4,0,...]/[4,0,4,...], indicating possible rotation or frame misextraction; inner 1s/2s are misplaced (e.g., generated row2 has 1 at 5 but expected row2 all 0s except 1s at 3-4; row4 has 2s at 4-5 but expected row4 2s at 4-5 ok, but surrounding 1s wrong); frame is included but inverted, inner figure vertically shifted down by ~1 row (unknown reason, likely y-range starts too early).
 * Function `get_main_bbox` is helpful but broken when y-range is noisy (propagates errors); `find_main_y_range` is essential but insufficient (needs connectivity or size threshold); no unhelpful functions, but the composition in `program` assumes single main block—add component detection for multi-blob grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of normalization but misses subtle noise exclusion and precise component isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it extracts a partial figure (5s on sides, 3s/4s in middle) but places it starting from row1 (with row0 as [0s,3,3,0s] like noise or bottom fragment), repeats the pattern in rows1-2/4-5 but inverts or shifts (e.g., row2 has 3s at 4-8 but test input row? has different), adds isolated 3 in row6 middle, then pads with 7+ zero rows— this suggests wrong y-range (included top noise, excluded bottom?), incomplete bbox (missing left/right alignments, e.g., 5s at 0-1 and 11-12 but 3s not centered), and over-padding without centering. Expected likely a tight square of the central cross-like figure (3s horizontal, 4s vertical-ish, framed by 5s) translated to top-left without extras, possibly 7x7 or similar s<13, but output bloats to 13x13 with misplaced elements (e.g., duplicated rows 1/5 and 2/4 indicate loop error or wrong min_y). It fails to isolate the main "plus" shape, including apparent noise 3s, and doesn't match a clean normalized output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting the "main" visual object or pattern from a sparse grid by identifying the bounding box of non-zero cells across relevant rows (not necessarily strictly consecutive), cropping to that subgrid, and then centering it within a square grid via symmetric padding with zeros, preserving the relative structure and values of the original content. The goal is to isolate and normalize the core artwork or symbol while ignoring outer noise or framing, but ensuring no distortion of internal zeros or shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main object" may span rows that are not fully consecutive non-zero counts; isolated zero rows within the object's vertical extent must be included if they are part of the bounding structure (e.g., gaps in patterns like letters or symbols), so the row selection should use the overall min-max row bounds of non-zeros rather than the longest consecutive block.
 * Column cropping must use the tightest bounding box across the selected rows, but padding must be centered (symmetric left/right, top/bottom) to maintain visual alignment, and the target square size should be based on the max of the cropped height/width without over-trimming internal structure.
 * Subtle elements include preserving exact non-zero values (e.g., 3,8,6) and their positions, including internal zeros that define shapes (e.g., holes in blobs); over-cropping can merge or shift these, leading to mismatches.
 * Grids may have outer zero framing or noise (e.g., stray non-zeros), which should be excluded; the output is always square, but size varies based on content (e.g., 13x13 for Train1, 10x10 for Train2/3).
 * Handle empty or all-zero inputs by returning a minimal [[0]] or similar, but real cases have clear central patterns.
 * Padding must not introduce asymmetry; use integer division for even/odd splits to center properly.
 * Non-zero count per row helps identify active rows, but the block-finding logic fails when the object has vertical gaps (common in puzzles like ASCII art or pixel drawings).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements row non-zero counting, per-row bounds, subgrid cropping, and centered padding to square, which works for dense objects without gaps (e.g., partial credit for column alignment in some cases).
 * Failed to select the full vertical extent of the object by using longest consecutive non-zero row block, excluding necessary gapped zero rows (e.g., in Train1, cropped rows 1-11 excluding top/bottom framing, leading to shifted content and mismatched shapes like extra 3's in row 0 col 2 vs. expected zero).
 * In Train1, generated output includes incorrect values/positions (e.g., row 2 has [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] but expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...]; row 5 has [0,3,8,8,6,6,...] but expected [3,3,8,8,6,6,...]—unknown reason for vertical shift/misalignment, possibly from wrong start_r).
 * Train2 generated mismatches in internal structure (e.g., row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], adding extra 3's and shifting 4's; row 4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs. expected [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0], wrong blob connectivity).
 * Train3 generated flips or misaligns patterns (e.g., row 0 [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]; entire top/bottom borders swapped, and internal 1/2 placements off like row 2 [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4]).
 * find_longest_block function is broken for gapped objects (assumes consecutive density, misses full height); not helpful for this puzzle—replace with overall min/max row of any non-zero.
 * No object extraction beyond density; lacks function to find global min/max row/col of all non-zeros, which would fix row selection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped too narrowly vertically (content only in rows 3-8 of 13, with symmetric zero padding top/bottom, but likely excludes parts of a taller object with gaps, similar to Train failures).
 * It centers a sub-pattern (e.g., 3's and 5's forming a shape with 4's inside), but the full 13x13 suggests the object spans more rows (e.g., top/bottom 5's and 3's may connect via sparse rows), leading to potential misalignment if gapped rows like row 3/9 are omitted.
 * Horizontal cropping seems okay (tight around cols 3-10), but vertical misses full extent (e.g., if test has framing like Train1, output should include more zero-gapped rows for correct shape like a letter or symbol).
 * Padding to 13x13 is oversized if object is smaller, but makes sense if global bounds are used; however, the isolated central block ignores potential outer connections, making the output incomplete (e.g., top/bottom rows all zero except possibly stray, but expected likely has adjusted framing).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers (likely representing a visual image or diagram with different "colors" or elements via numbers like 3,8,6) to extract and isolate the main central "object" or figure by cropping to its tight bounding box and then padding with zeros to form a centered square grid of appropriate size. The goal is to remove extraneous border or empty space while preserving the structure of the core content, ensuring the output matches the expected cropped and padded form exactly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main object may not occupy every row or column fully, so cropping must use the minimal bounding box that encloses all non-zero elements of the object without including irrelevant outer zeros or disconnected elements.
 * Padding must be centered (symmetric where possible, with even/odd distribution) both horizontally and vertically to make the grid square, using the maximum of the cropped height and width as the target size.
 * Non-zero counts per row are useful for identifying dense regions, but the "max sum nonzero block" must consider the actual connected or primary object, not just any consecutive dense rows—subtleties include handling objects that span irregular rows (e.g., with sparse rows in between) or have protrusions that affect column bounds.
 * Column bounds should be computed only over the selected rows to avoid including distant non-zeros outside the main object.
 * The grid may have symmetric borders or frames (e.g., repeating patterns like 3's or 5's around the edges), which should be excluded if they are not part of the core figure.
 * Subtle elements: Objects can have internal zeros (holes or gaps) that should be preserved, but the bounding box ignores them for cropping; ensure no shearing, shifting, or alteration of values during crop/pad.
 * All non-zero elements in the output must match positions and values exactly from the input's main object; extraneous non-zeros (e.g., from borders) lead to mismatches.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids default to [[0]]; objects may not be rectangular, so tight bounds are key; padding adds zeros only outside the crop.

These cropping and padding functions are helpful and correctly implement tight bounding box extraction and centered square padding, but they depend on accurate row/column selection upstream.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements bounding box cropping and centered padding to square, which preserves internal structure and adds zeros appropriately, but fails because row selection via max consecutive nonzero sum includes extraneous rows (e.g., top/bottom borders with partial non-zeros).
 * In training example 1, generated includes extra top/bottom rows with misplaced 3's (e.g., generated row 0: [0,0,3,0,3,0,...] vs expected row 0: [0,0,0,3,0,0,...]) and shifts internal elements (e.g., row 2 generated [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]), likely due to wrong row start/end and column bounds including border artifacts; bottom row also mismatches (generated [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]).
 * In training example 2, generated crops too tightly or shifts columns, omitting some 3's and 4's (e.g., generated row 3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected row 3: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], missing right-side 3's and altering 5 positions); also includes top row non-zeros incorrectly while expected has more zeros there.
 * In training example 3, generated starts with wrong row order (e.g., generated row 0: [4,0,4,0,...] vs expected row 0: [0,4,0,4,...]), indicating failure to identify the correct starting row for the object, and internal mismatches like row 2 generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] show shifted or incomplete bounds.
 * The find_max_sum_nonzero_block function is broken/not helpful as it assumes consecutive dense rows define the object, but puzzles have non-consecutive or bordered elements, leading to over-inclusion; don't use it in future without refinement to detect the primary connected component.
 * Overall, the approach demonstrates partial understanding of cropping/padding but misses identifying the exact main object bounds, treating borders as part of the figure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 square with the main content (3's,5's,4's forming what seems like a figure or letter) centered in rows 4-8 and columns 4-8, but padded heavily with outer zeros, which may be too loose—likely the expected is a tighter crop to just the non-zero block (e.g., 5x5 or similar square without the large empty borders), as the current method includes empty rows/columns from the input's sparse layout, mismatching the training expectations where tighter, object-focused squares are produced without extraneous space.
 * It incorrectly assumes the entire input height needs full padding to 13x13, but the object appears confined to a smaller central area (rows ~3-8, cols ~3-9), so the output bloats the grid unnecessarily and may shift positions if bounds are off, similar to training failures.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 14:47:06] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves extracting a central or primary "object" or pattern from a larger grid of numbers (likely representing a visual image or diagram with filled cells), by cropping to the bounding area of the main content while excluding borders, noise, or extraneous elements, and then padding the result to a square shape for output. The goal is to preserve the structure of the core pattern, which appears to be a connected or dense region of non-zero values, but the cropping must be precise to match subtle asymmetries or exclusions in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping should focus on the minimal bounding box around the densest or most connected non-zero regions, but not necessarily the absolute max-sum contiguous segment, as this can include unwanted extensions (e.g., thin borders or disconnected parts).
 * Padding to square must center the content evenly, using zeros, but only after accurate cropping; over-cropping or under-cropping leads to shifted or incomplete patterns.
 * Grids have varying sizes and may include symmetric borders (e.g., repeating patterns like 3's or 5's on edges) that should be partially or fully excluded to isolate the inner object.
 * Non-zero counts in rows/columns are key, but the "max sum positive segment" approach overemphasizes density and can merge separate regions; subtleties include handling gaps (zeros) within the object without breaking it, and excluding outer frames even if they have non-zeros.
 * Expected outputs often rotate, shift, or selectively include/exclude rows/columns compared to naive bounding boxes, suggesting rules for "main object" identification (e.g., largest connected component via flood-fill, or excluding perimeter noise).
 * Asymmetries in expected vs. generated: e.g., in training 1, expected excludes some left/top non-zeros and adjusts right/bottom; in training 2, expected shifts inner patterns and excludes certain edge non-zeros; in training 3, expected reorders or rotates outer frames while cropping inner differently.
 * All examples show the output padded to square (e.g., 13x13 for training 1, 10x10 for 2 and 3, 7x7 for test), implying the crop size determines the square side as max(height, width) of crop.
 * Subtle element: Objects may have internal zeros (holes or gaps) that should be preserved, but the bounding box must encompass the entire logical shape without extending to surrounding zeros or borders.
 * Consider connected components: The main object is likely the largest or most central blob of non-zeros, ignoring small isolated parts.
 * Padding is symmetric (floor/ceil division for even/odd differences), but cropping errors propagate to make outputs visually "off-center" or missing parts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [sum(1 for x in row if x != 0) for row in g]
```
(This computes per-row non-zero density, useful for initial vertical scanning to identify candidate row ranges.)

```python
def col_nonzero_counts(selected_g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not selected_g:
        return []
    n_cols = len(selected_g[0])
    counts = [0] * n_cols
    for row in selected_g:
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                counts[j] += 1
    return counts
```
(This computes per-column non-zero density on a row-selected subgrid, useful for horizontal refinement.)

```python
def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, start_c: int, end_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[start_c:end_c + 1] for row in g[start_r:end_r + 1]]
```
(Basic cropping utility; correct and reusable, but needs better start/end logic.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped or not any(any(x != 0 for x in row) for row in cropped):
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    s = max(h, w)
    # Assuming pad_columns and pad_rows are defined as in the attempt (they handle left/right and top/bottom zero padding symmetrically)
    cropped = pad_columns(cropped, s)  # Placeholder; implement as in attempt
    cropped = pad_rows(cropped, s)     # Placeholder; implement as in attempt
    return cropped
```
(Padding logic is solid for making square; handles empty cases and centering well, but only useful after correct cropping.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The max-sum positive segment finder works for identifying dense row/column ranges but fails by including extraneous border non-zeros (e.g., in training 1, it captures outer 3's on left/right, leading to wider crop than expected; generated row 0 has [0,0,3,0,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,...], shifting the pattern rightward).
 * In training 1, generated includes extra top/bottom rows and left columns with partial 3's/8's, making the output 13x13 but misaligned (e.g., row 2 generated has 8's starting too early; expected excludes some left 3's and adjusts inner 8/6 placements); unknown why it over-extends, possibly due to segment including zero-gapped borders.
 * Training 2 generated crops too narrowly or shifts inner 3/4 patterns incorrectly (e.g., row 1 has 3 in col 3, but expected has it later; row 3 generated [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], missing left exclusions and including unwanted 3's); col segment finder likely grabs partial densities.
 * Training 2 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., row 7 generated matches but row 4 has extra 3's); suggests row selection is okay but col cropping cuts off right edges incorrectly.
 * In training 3, generated preserves outer 4's but crops inner 1/2 differently (e.g., row 2 generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,...], including left 4's that should be excluded and missing right shifts); appears to treat borders as part of the object.
 * Overall, the approach understands density-based cropping but misses excluding perimeter frames (common in all examples) and handling asymmetries (e.g., expected often trims one side more than the other).
 * find_max_sum_positive_segment_indices is partially helpful for contiguous dense areas but broken for puzzles with gapped or asymmetric objects (skips zeros too aggressively, missing holistic bounding).
 * No connected component analysis (e.g., flood-fill to find main blob) was attempted, which seems essential for isolating the core pattern from borders.
 * pad_to_square and related padders are correct and not the failure point; issues are upstream in selection/cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 7x7 grid that appears cropped to a central cross-like pattern with 3's on borders and inner 4's, but without the test input grid, it's hard to verify; however, based on training patterns, it likely over-includes edge 3's (e.g., row 0 [0,0,3,3,0,0,0] suggests partial border capture) and may misalign the inner 4 (only one 4 visible in row 3, possibly too narrow crop).
 * It does not look fully correct, as training attempts consistently failed by similar over-extension (e.g., including outer frames), so this probably includes unwanted perimeter elements while potentially excluding subtle inner extensions; the bottom row [0,0,0,0,3,0,0] looks like asymmetric padding or cropping error.
 * To handle test case, need better border detection (e.g., exclude rows/cols with uniform low-density patterns) and verify against expected by mentally simulating: assuming test input has outer 3-frames like training 1/2, correct output should trim them more aggressively for a tighter inner square.

[2025-10-03 14:47:06] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop a grid to focus on the "main" or central non-zero content (likely a symbol, digit, or pattern formed by numbers like 3, 5, 6, 8 representing filled pixels or segments), then pad it symmetrically with zeros to form a square grid of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, while preserving the relative positions and ensuring alignment matches the expected output. The process involves identifying contiguous rows with significant non-zero activity, computing tight column bounds within those rows, cropping, and centering via padding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping must use the tightest bounding box around the main object, but only for contiguous rows that form the core pattern—do not include isolated border rows or rows with minimal/sparse non-zeros if they are not part of the contiguous block, as this can shift the content left/right or include/exclude elements incorrectly.
 * Padding must be centered (even distribution on top/bottom and left/right), but the side length is the max of cropped height/width; however, if the input is already square-like, avoid over-padding or shifting the content asymmetrically.
 * Subtle element: The "main" row for starting the crop is the one with the highest non-zero count, but the contiguous block must extend only to rows where counts >0 without skipping zeros inside the object (but zeros inside are okay if part of the pattern); overlooking internal zero rows within the object can truncate it.
 * Grids may have border-like zeros or sparse rows (e.g., single non-zeros) that should be excluded from the crop to avoid including "frames" or artifacts, but the expected outputs sometimes retain specific sparse elements if they are integral to the pattern's edges.
 * Column bounds must be computed per the selected row range, but min/max columns should ignore empty rows within the range—easy to miss if bounds include padding from empty sub-rows.
 * Patterns involve numbers (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6/4/5 for fills), so treat all non-zero as "filled" for counting/bounds, but preserve exact values in output.
 * Inputs are rectangular lists of lists, outputs must be square and exactly match expected row-by-row, including zero placements.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return [[0]]; sparse patterns may require manual adjustment if auto-contiguous misses disconnected but related parts (though examples suggest patterns are contiguous).
 * From attempts: Row extension (start/end) works for dense centers but fails if the max-count row is not perfectly centered in the object, leading to asymmetric crops; padding functions are correct but applied after wrong crop, causing shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_count(row: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [row_nonzero_count(row) for row in g]

def find_max_count_row(counts: List[int]) -> int:
    if not counts:
        return 0
    max_i = 0
    max_c = counts[0]
    for i in range(1, len(counts)):
        if counts[i] > max_c:
            max_c = counts[i]
            max_i = i
    return max_i

def find_start_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    s = start
    while s > 0 and counts[s - 1] > 0:
        s -= 1
    return s

def find_end_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    e = start
    n = len(counts)
    while e < n - 1 and counts[e + 1] > 0:
        e += 1
    return e
```
These are helpful for identifying the core row range based on non-zero density.

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds

def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, n_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c

def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
These are useful for per-row and aggregate bounds, and basic cropping; they correctly compute min/max but fail if row range is wrong.

```python
def pad_columns(cropped: List[List[int]], target_width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_width = len(cropped[0])
    if current_width >= target_width:
        return cropped
    col_pad_left = (target_width - current_width) // 2
    col_pad_right = target_width - current_width - col_pad_left
    for r in range(len(cropped)):
        cropped[r] = [0] * col_pad_left + cropped[r] + [0] * col_pad_right
    return cropped

def pad_rows(cropped: List[List[int]], target_size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_height = len(cropped)
    if current_height >= target_size:
        return cropped
    row_pad_top = (target_size - current_height) // 2
    row_pad_bottom = target_size - current_height - row_pad_top
    size = len(cropped[0])
    for _ in range(row_pad_top):
        cropped.insert(0, [0] * size)
    for _ in range(row_pad_bottom):
        cropped.append([0] * size)
    return cropped
```
These handle symmetric padding well and are not broken—use them after fixing crop.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the max non-zero row and extends to contiguous non-zero rows, which works for dense central patterns but fails when the object has internal zero-count rows or when sparse edge rows (e.g., borders) should be excluded, leading to over-inclusion of empty space.
 * Cropping via row/column bounds is mostly right but computes min/max too broadly within the row range, including outliers from sparse rows, causing left-shifted content (e.g., in Train 1, generated row 0 has 3's at positions 2 and 4, but expected at 3 and 10, indicating wrong column start).
 * Padding to square is correct in logic (centered, max(h,w) side), but since crop is wrong, the final grid has shifted/misaligned patterns—e.g., Train 1 generated includes extra left zeros and wrong placements in rows 2-10 compared to expected (e.g., generated row 2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...], missing leading zeros and altering 3/8 positions).
 * Train 2 mismatches in row 1 (generated [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0], wrong 3 position) and row 3 (generated [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], extra 3's and shifted), suggesting column bounds grabbed too wide or wrong row range excluded top sparse rows.
 * Train 3 mismatches entirely in row ordering and content—generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips even/odd rows ([0,4,0,...] first), indicating the contiguous row finder or crop ignored the alternating border pattern, treating it as non-contiguous or wrong start row.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond bounds; a function to detect connected components (e.g., flood-fill for blobs) might help if patterns have disconnected parts, but current attempt lacks this—consider adding for future if contiguity fails.
 * The overall program(g) handles empty cases well but defaults to full grid crop if bounds fail, which over-pads without centering the true object.
 * Function `program` integrates everything but is broken due to row range logic—don't reuse without fixing start/end finders to skip zero-count rows outside the main block.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to crop/pad the entire input grid (13x13) with minimal trimming, resulting in large zero borders (e.g., rows 0-2 and 9-12 all zeros, content squeezed in rows 3-8 but shifted right with uneven columns, like 5's at edges but 3/4 patterns not centered). 
 * Compared to mentally running rules: The test input has a central cross-like pattern with 5's on sides, 3's in middle rows/columns, and a 4 in row 6 col 6; correct output should crop tightly to rows ~3-8 (height 6), columns ~3-9 (width 7, side=7), pad to 7x7 centered (e.g., add 0.5 rows top/bottom, 0 left/1 right), preserving exact 3/4/5 positions without the full 13x13 bloat or left/right shifts seen in generated (e.g., generated row 4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] includes outer 5's but expected would trim them if borders, centering the inner 3's and single 4).
 * It makes sense as a failed full-grid pad but not as correct extraction—missing tight crop leads to oversized zeros, and content alignment (e.g., 5's too far left in generated row 4) doesn't match a centered pattern; unknown why it didn't trim columns better, but likely because col_bounds took min_c=0 from edge 5's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely pixel art or ASCII-like representations with numbers as colors/values) where the goal is to extract or crop the "main object" or central content from a larger grid that includes borders, frames, or extraneous zero-padded areas. The extraction should produce a subgrid that matches the expected "clean" or bounded version of the object, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while trimming surrounding zeros appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid always has fixed dimensions (e.g., 20 columns in example 1, 10 in others), but the main object does not span the full width or height; borders often consist of patterned zeros or repeating non-zeros (e.g., 3's or 5's forming frames).
 * Non-zero rows are not always fully consecutive; there may be isolated zero rows at the top/bottom that should be excluded, but the "longest block" approach misses cases where the object has internal zero rows or irregular shapes.
 * Column cropping must account for the tightest bounding box per row group, but min/max columns are calculated per row in the block—subtleties include asymmetric objects where left/right edges vary, and zeros within the object should be preserved (not trimmed internally).
 * Objects may have "legs" or extensions (e.g., in example 1, the bottom row has sparse 3's that differ in generated vs. expected), requiring per-row min/max rather than global for the block.
 * All examples show symmetric or framed structures (e.g., 5's as borders in example 2, 4's in example 3), so extraction should ignore outer frames and focus on inner content; however, frames may integrate with the object (e.g., 3's in example 1 seem part of the object).
 * Expected outputs preserve some leading/trailing zeros within rows to maintain shape (e.g., example 1 expected has [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] vs. generated [0,0,3,0,3,...]), indicating no global left-trimming—crop to the union of all non-zero positions across the relevant rows.
 * Subtle element: The "object" may span nearly all rows but exclude thin top/bottom zero rows; in example 3, the object is rotated or checkerboard-patterned, and extraction flips or reorders rows/columns incorrectly.
 * Consider connectivity: Non-zeros may form disconnected blobs, but examples suggest extracting the primary connected component (e.g., ignore small isolated elements).
 * Height of extracted grid varies (13 rows in example 1, 10 in others), so dynamically determine start/end rows based on first/last non-all-zero rows, not just longest block.
 * Numbers represent colors/types (e.g., 3=one type, 8=another), so preserve exact values; zeros are background.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a longest consecutive non-zero row block to determine height, which worked partially for examples 1 and 2 (captured most rows) but failed in example 3 by including extra patterned rows (e.g., generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected starts with [0,4,0,...], indicating wrong row order or selection).
 * Global min/max column calculation worked for rough width in example 1 (13 cols output) but produced incorrect content: e.g., train 1 generated first row [0,0,3,0,3,0,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...], missing a leading zero and including an extra 3 early—likely due to min_c=1 instead of 3, shifting the slice left.
 * In train 2, generated included extraneous elements like [0,3,3,0,4,...] in row 4 vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], showing the uniform slice didn't align with the inner object's varying left edges (e.g., expected has more leading zeros in some rows).
 * Train 3 generated a near-full grid but mismatched row order and content: e.g., first row [4,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,...], and internal rows like generated [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—suggests the block finder took wrong start/end, and column slicing ignored the checkerboard symmetry.
 * The has_non_zero function is solid and essential for row detection.
 * find_longest_block is partially helpful but broken for gapped or framed objects (e.g., misses that example 3 has alternating non-zero rows throughout).
 * find_min_col and find_max_col are flawed—not helpful as-is, since they compute global bounds but objects need per-row trimming or union bounds that preserve internal spacing; using them leads to shifted or squished outputs.
 * Overall program demonstrates basic bounding box understanding but ignores frame detection and per-row variation, causing all mismatches; no object extraction beyond crude cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same flawed longest-block + global min/max column slicing, producing 7 rows of width 13, but the content shows irregular 5's and 3's that seem like a partial frame or object (e.g., first row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,...] suggests top border, but middle rows like [5,5,0,3,3,3,...] include outer 5's that may be frame elements to exclude).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: e.g., symmetric 5-borders in rows 2,4,6 suggest the output included frame instead of cropping to inner 3/4 content; the sparse bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,...] looks like it trimmed too much vertically, missing potential object extensions.
 * The output has varying non-zero positions (e.g., 3's clustered in cols 5-9, 5's on edges), indicating the global slice shifted everything left (min_c too low), distorting the shape—likely incorrect as it doesn't preserve the "clean" inner object seen in training expecteds.
 * No way to confirm exact expected without rules, but it fails to handle frame-like 5's (similar to train 2's borders), so probably needs frame detection or better row selection to exclude top/bottom zeros properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving sparse grids of integers (likely representing colored cells or patterns), where the goal is to extract a cropped subgrid that captures the "main" figure or object while removing extraneous empty (zero) borders or padding, resulting in a tighter, possibly rectangular bounding area around the non-zero content. The extraction should preserve the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but trim outer empty rows/columns to focus on the core pattern, without forcing a square shape or including unnecessary whitespace.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids are often large (e.g., 18x18 or 19x19) with significant empty (zero) areas on the borders, especially left/right columns and top/bottom rows; the output must crop these dynamically to the minimal or near-minimal bounding rectangle enclosing all non-zero cells, but not so aggressively that internal zeros (part of the pattern) are removed.
 * Outputs are rectangular, not necessarily square—e.g., training example 1 expects 13x13 but with irregular non-zero distribution; forcing square shapes (as in the current program) leads to oversized or misaligned extractions that include padding.
 * Non-zero cells form connected or semi-connected "objects" (e.g., borders, shapes like 3's, 8's, 6's in train1; 5's, 3's, 4's in train2; 4's and inner patterns in train3), and the extraction should encompass the largest or primary object without fragmenting it or including disconnected outliers.
 * Internal zeros within the pattern must be preserved (e.g., gaps in shapes), but outer pure-zero rows/columns should be trimmed; subtle elements include asymmetric padding (more empty on left in train1) and potential for multiple disjoint objects (e.g., small isolated cells in test input like bottom-right 5's).
 * The puzzle may involve identifying a "frame" or border (e.g., alternating 4's in train3) as part of the core pattern, so cropping shouldn't remove structural edges unless they are fully empty.
 * Grids can have varying sizes, so the program must compute bounds dynamically rather than hardcoding; consider row/column spans of non-zeros, but account for cases where the "main" object doesn't span the full height/width (e.g., train2 has empty middle rows in output? No, output includes them if part of bounds).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs can have leading/trailing zeros in rows if they are part of the pattern's edge (e.g., train1 row1 starts/ends with zeros), but entire rows/columns of zeros on the perimeter should be omitted; also, rotation or reordering (seen in train3 mismatch) isn't needed—extraction is positional cropping.
 * Across attempts (only one shown, but implied iterations): Prioritize bounding box over density; handle varying grid sizes without assuming square; avoid maximizing non-zeros in a square, as it grabs too-wide areas with padding (e.g., train1 includes 5+ left zeros per row).

    return [[g[i][j] for j in range(start_col, end_col)] for i in range(start_row, end_row)]
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `find_largest_square_block`: Broken for this puzzle—forces square (w == h) and maximizes non-zero count within it, leading to padded or oversized extractions (e.g., grabs full-width with left zeros in train1); ignores rectangular bounds and includes empty rows/columns; not relevant, as puzzle outputs aren't strictly square.
 * Current `program`: Relies on square finder, so always fails on asymmetric patterns; extracts too much padding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown uses a square-focused approach, which worked partially by identifying dense non-zero areas (e.g., captured most of the 3/8/6 patterns in train1) but failed by including excessive left/top/bottom padding zeros, resulting in oversized/wider outputs (18 cols vs. expected 13 in train1; 15 vs. 10 in train2).
 * Train1: Generated a near-full grid with 5+ leading zeros per row and extra bottom empty rows, mismatching expected cropped version (starts trimming at col 3, ends at col 15-ish, removes left empty block); unknown why it picked h=11 starting at row 0, but it over-included empties; nz maximization grabbed too-wide span (min_c=6, w=11? but still padded).
 * Train2: Generated included extra left/right empties and mismatched row lengths (15 vs. 10), capturing 5/3/4 patterns but with padding (e.g., leading zeros in rows); failed to crop tightly around the central object, adding irrelevant empty rows at bottom.
 * Train3: Generated almost the full 10x10 but with rows 1-2 swapped and inner pattern misaligned (e.g., row3 has [4,0,0,0,0,1,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,...]), suggesting wrong start/min_col (perhaps picked h=10, s=0, min_c=0 including border but shifting?); close in size but positionally wrong, missing subtle inner crop.
 * extract_subgrid is mostly helpful but limited to square (h-wide); get_nonzero_cols_per_row is essential for span detection but underused (only for min/max col, not full bounds).
 * Overall: Missed rectangular cropping; considered density over bounds; no handling for asymmetric empties; train samples all failed due to padding inclusion; function forcing square is incorrect (don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it extracts a very wide (19 cols?) rectangular strip starting from the left, including massive empty padding (e.g., rows 1-5 have 3-18 leading zeros before any non-zero like 5 or 3), and captures disjoint elements (top-left 3's, mid-right 5's block, bottom 3/4/5 patterns) without tight cropping, resulting in a sparse, non-focused grid that doesn't isolate a "main" figure.
 * It mismatches what a correct output should be: mentally, the test input has a small top-left 3/5 cluster (rows 0-4, cols 0-3), a mid-right 5's block (rows 6-8, cols 11-14), a large bottom-center 3/4/5 object (rows 10-14, cols 6-17), and scattered bottom 5's (rows 17-18); a correct extraction likely needs to bound the largest/dominant object (bottom 3/4/5, ~5x12), cropping to ~ rows 10-15, cols 6-18, yielding a tighter 6x13 with preserved internals, not the full padded mess; current output includes irrelevant top empties and doesn't focus, making it look like a raw dump rather than a puzzle solution.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of numbers (likely representing pixel-like patterns or objects with different values like 3,5,8,4,6,1,2 indicating colors, shapes, or densities), where the goal is to automatically detect, extract, and isolate the "main" or central patterned object(s) by cropping to their bounding box and padding to a square grid, while removing extraneous empty space, noise, or secondary elements. The output must match the expected clean, centered square representations exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements within the object.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids contain multiple potential "objects" or patterns (e.g., scattered numbers like 3's forming borders, 8's in shapes, 5's in lines), but only the primary cohesive one(s) should be extracted—secondary or isolated elements (e.g., lone 8's at the bottom in training example 1, or small 3's/4's in example 2) must be omitted to avoid bloating the output.
 * Extraction involves identifying a contiguous block of rows and columns that tightly bounds the main object, not just the densest rows via sum of non-zeros; subtle connections (e.g., via adjacent non-zeros) or visual coherence (e.g., forming a recognizable shape like a figure or symbol) should guide selection, as pure density (Kadane's) misses vertically sparse but connected parts.
 * Padding must center the cropped object in a square of size equal to the max dimension of the crop, using zeros; however, over-padding or including empty rows/columns leads to mismatched sizes (e.g., generated outputs often have 19x19 with excessive zeros, while expected are smaller like 13x13 or 10x10).
 * Non-zero values must be preserved exactly (no alteration), and the output grid must be rectangular lists of lists, but represented as square after padding; subtle elements include handling irregular shapes where first/last non-zero columns vary per row, requiring global min/max bounds per block, but avoiding blocks that include disconnected noise.
 * Grids may have varying sizes (e.g., 19x19 in example 1, 17x17 in example 2), with empty borders or padding already present; extraction should ignore outer zeros but detect if the main object spans most of the grid or is offset.
 * Connected components (e.g., 4-connected or 8-connected non-zeros) might be key to identify "objects" rather than row sums, as current method grabs loose contiguous rows including gaps.
 * Edge cases: All-zero grids return [[0]]; single-object grids need tight crop; multiple objects require selecting the largest/coherent one (e.g., in example 3, ignore top scattered 1's and 4's, focus on central patterned block).
 * Outputs are shown as flattened rows but are 2D lists; mismatches often in size (too big) or content (extra zeros/noise included).

    # ... (code as provided, but flawed logic for if counts[i] > max_current + counts[i], which is always true if counts[i] > 0; buggy comparison)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by selecting overly broad row blocks via flawed Kadane's on row non-zero sums, leading to inclusion of empty or sparse rows (e.g., in training 1, generated a 19x19 with bottom empty rows and side zeros, while expected is 13x13 tight crop of central 3/8/6 pattern; difference: extra padding and missed tight row 2-12 crop, omitting bottom 8's correctly but bloating size).
 * In training 2, generated scattered 5/3/4 elements across a large zero-padded grid, including isolated top/bottom parts, while expected is 10x10 tight extraction of central 5/3/4 shape; difference: wrong row selection (e.g., included row 2 with single 5, but expected starts from denser block), resulting in disconnected output.
 * In training 3, generated a mess with top scattered 1's/4's and bottom empty, missing the central 4/1/2 pattern; expected 10x10 vertical crop/pad of rows ~10-18; difference: selected wrong block (rows 2-3 and 9-18 loosely), ignoring main object's vertical span.
 * Cropping and padding functions worked technically (produced square outputs), but fed bad inputs, so outputs mismatched in content (extra zeros, wrong elements) and size.
 * No connected component analysis, so missed subtle object cohesion (e.g., 8-connected non-zeros for shapes); density sum overlooked vertical/horizontal sparsity in main objects.
 * Bug in Kadane's: The condition `if counts[i] > max_current + counts[i]` simplifies to `0 > max_current`, which is rarely true, causing incorrect start/end indices (e.g., often picks single high-density rows or full grid).
 * extract_objects not present, but would be essential—current approach lacks object detection, treating rows independently.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a large ~19x19 grid with scattered 5's, 3's, and 4's in disconnected patches (e.g., isolated 5's in rows 1-5 and 7-8, then a partial 3/4/5 shape in rows 11-15, plus bottom 5's), heavily zero-padded, resembling noise rather than a cohesive object. This mismatches what a correct extraction should be: likely a tight square crop of the central-right 3/4/5 pattern (rows ~11-15, columns ~7-18 or similar, forming a shape like in training 2), padded to ~9x9 or 10x10, omitting top-left 3's/5's and bottom 5's as secondary. The output includes extraneous elements (e.g., top 3's in row 3, lone 4 in row 2) and excessive empty space, indicating the row block selection grabbed too much (probably rows 0-18 via poor density), failing to isolate the main clustered object around the 3/4/5 block.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves extracting a central or primary "object" or pattern from a larger grid of numbers (likely representing a visual image or diagram with filled cells), by cropping to the bounding area of the main content while excluding borders, noise, or extraneous elements, and then padding the result to a square shape for output. The goal is to preserve the structure of the core pattern, which appears to be a connected or dense region of non-zero values, but the cropping must be precise to match subtle asymmetries or exclusions in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping should focus on the minimal bounding box around the densest or most connected non-zero regions, but not necessarily the absolute max-sum contiguous segment, as this can include unwanted extensions (e.g., thin borders or disconnected parts).
 * Padding to square must center the content evenly, using zeros, but only after accurate cropping; over-cropping or under-cropping leads to shifted or incomplete patterns.
 * Grids have varying sizes and may include symmetric borders (e.g., repeating patterns like 3's or 5's on edges) that should be partially or fully excluded to isolate the inner object.
 * Non-zero counts in rows/columns are key, but the "max sum positive segment" approach overemphasizes density and can merge separate regions; subtleties include handling gaps (zeros) within the object without breaking it, and excluding outer frames even if they have non-zeros.
 * Expected outputs often rotate, shift, or selectively include/exclude rows/columns compared to naive bounding boxes, suggesting rules for "main object" identification (e.g., largest connected component via flood-fill, or excluding perimeter noise).
 * Asymmetries in expected vs. generated: e.g., in training 1, expected excludes some left/top non-zeros and adjusts right/bottom; in training 2, expected shifts inner patterns and excludes certain edge non-zeros; in training 3, expected reorders or rotates outer frames while cropping inner differently.
 * All examples show the output padded to square (e.g., 13x13 for training 1, 10x10 for 2 and 3, 7x7 for test), implying the crop size determines the square side as max(height, width) of crop.
 * Subtle element: Objects may have internal zeros (holes or gaps) that should be preserved, but the bounding box must encompass the entire logical shape without extending to surrounding zeros or borders.
 * Consider connected components: The main object is likely the largest or most central blob of non-zeros, ignoring small isolated parts.
 * Padding is symmetric (floor/ceil division for even/odd differences), but cropping errors propagate to make outputs visually "off-center" or missing parts.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [sum(1 for x in row if x != 0) for row in g]
```
(This computes per-row non-zero density, useful for initial vertical scanning to identify candidate row ranges.)

```python
def col_nonzero_counts(selected_g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not selected_g:
        return []
    n_cols = len(selected_g[0])
    counts = [0] * n_cols
    for row in selected_g:
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                counts[j] += 1
    return counts
```
(This computes per-column non-zero density on a row-selected subgrid, useful for horizontal refinement.)

```python
def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, start_c: int, end_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[start_c:end_c + 1] for row in g[start_r:end_r + 1]]
```
(Basic cropping utility; correct and reusable, but needs better start/end logic.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped or not any(any(x != 0 for x in row) for row in cropped):
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    s = max(h, w)
    # Assuming pad_columns and pad_rows are defined as in the attempt (they handle left/right and top/bottom zero padding symmetrically)
    cropped = pad_columns(cropped, s)  # Placeholder; implement as in attempt
    cropped = pad_rows(cropped, s)     # Placeholder; implement as in attempt
    return cropped
```
(Padding logic is solid for making square; handles empty cases and centering well, but only useful after correct cropping.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The max-sum positive segment finder works for identifying dense row/column ranges but fails by including extraneous border non-zeros (e.g., in training 1, it captures outer 3's on left/right, leading to wider crop than expected; generated row 0 has [0,0,3,0,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,...], shifting the pattern rightward).
 * In training 1, generated includes extra top/bottom rows and left columns with partial 3's/8's, making the output 13x13 but misaligned (e.g., row 2 generated has 8's starting too early; expected excludes some left 3's and adjusts inner 8/6 placements); unknown why it over-extends, possibly due to segment including zero-gapped borders.
 * Training 2 generated crops too narrowly or shifts inner 3/4 patterns incorrectly (e.g., row 1 has 3 in col 3, but expected has it later; row 3 generated [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], missing left exclusions and including unwanted 3's); col segment finder likely grabs partial densities.
 * Training 2 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., row 7 generated matches but row 4 has extra 3's); suggests row selection is okay but col cropping cuts off right edges incorrectly.
 * In training 3, generated preserves outer 4's but crops inner 1/2 differently (e.g., row 2 generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,...], including left 4's that should be excluded and missing right shifts); appears to treat borders as part of the object.
 * Overall, the approach understands density-based cropping but misses excluding perimeter frames (common in all examples) and handling asymmetries (e.g., expected often trims one side more than the other).
 * find_max_sum_positive_segment_indices is partially helpful for contiguous dense areas but broken for puzzles with gapped or asymmetric objects (skips zeros too aggressively, missing holistic bounding).
 * No connected component analysis (e.g., flood-fill to find main blob) was attempted, which seems essential for isolating the core pattern from borders.
 * pad_to_square and related padders are correct and not the failure point; issues are upstream in selection/cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 7x7 grid that appears cropped to a central cross-like pattern with 3's on borders and inner 4's, but without the test input grid, it's hard to verify; however, based on training patterns, it likely over-includes edge 3's (e.g., row 0 [0,0,3,3,0,0,0] suggests partial border capture) and may misalign the inner 4 (only one 4 visible in row 3, possibly too narrow crop).
 * It does not look fully correct, as training attempts consistently failed by similar over-extension (e.g., including outer frames), so this probably includes unwanted perimeter elements while potentially excluding subtle inner extensions; the bottom row [0,0,0,0,3,0,0] looks like asymmetric padding or cropping error.
 * To handle test case, need better border detection (e.g., exclude rows/cols with uniform low-density patterns) and verify against expected by mentally simulating: assuming test input has outer 3-frames like training 1/2, correct output should trim them more aggressively for a tighter inner square.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

    """Find the start and end indices of the longest sequence of significant non-empty rows."""

    # Generally correct for centering, but can produce oversized/off-center results if crop is wrong (e.g., 13x13 with uneven pads).
```
The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with different "colors" or values like 3,6,8) to extract the central or main non-zero content, crop it to a tight bounding box, and pad it symmetrically to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main block" should be identified as the longest consecutive sequence of rows with any non-zero elements, but care must be taken to exclude leading/trailing fully zero rows without including isolated zero rows within the block if they are structurally important (e.g., in example 1, internal zero positions are preserved but the block start/end must align precisely with the expected cropped area).
 * Column bounds must be computed only over the main row block, finding the minimal and maximal non-zero columns across those rows, but without expanding beyond the actual content—subtly, if a row in the block has no non-zeros (but is included in the block due to adjacency), its bounds should not affect min/max (current compute_col_bounds skips if l==-1, which is good, but may still misalign if block includes empty rows incorrectly).
 * Padding to square must be symmetric (centering the content) using zeros, first padding columns to match height, then rows to match the new width, but the target size is max(h,w) after cropping—issue is that if cropping misses parts, padding adds extra zeros in wrong places (e.g., in example 1, generated adds unintended non-zeros or shifts content left/right).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes with borders of zeros; the output should be square but retain the exact relative positions of non-zeros from the cropped area (e.g., example 2 shows misalignment in rows 3-4 where generated has [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] but expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], indicating column crop is too narrow or shifted).
 * Subtle element: Non-zeros represent "pixels" of different types (e.g., 3 might be borders, 6/8 fills), and the puzzle likely requires exact reproduction without altering values or introducing new ones—easy to miss that bounding box must be inclusive of all edge non-zeros but exclusive of outer empty space.
 * In example 3, the pattern alternates rows/columns, and generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips the starting row order, suggesting possible row reversal or reordering not handled (or wrong block detection includes extra).
 * General: Handle empty or all-zero grids by returning [[0]]; assume rectangular input; outputs are lists of lists, printed as rows.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), consider that main block detection uses row non-zero counts correctly but may over-include if zero rows are adjacent (e.g., example 1 generated includes row 0 with partial non-zeros? Wait, generated row 0 [0,0,3,0,3,...] suggests crop started too early or wrong min_c).

    best_end = best_start + max_len - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```

        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row min/max non-zero columns; essential for tight cropping, but only applied to main block rows.)

            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c

(Combines row bounds for overall column crop; helpful but may yield empty if all rows in block are zero, leading to [[0]] fallback.)

            lst[r] = [0] * left_or_top + lst[r] + [0] * right_or_bottom
    return lst
```
(Handles symmetric zero-padding for dimensions; useful and correct in isolation, but applied after faulty crop leads to misaligned content.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    size = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, False)  # pad columns
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, True)   # pad rows
    return cropped
```
(Overall squaring logic; helpful but order matters—padding columns first then rows ensures square, but if w > h initially, row padding adds to height correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the concept of finding a main non-zero block via row counts and cropping to bounding box, which works for isolating content in dense grids but fails on precise start/end (e.g., Train 1 generated starts crop too early, including extraneous left-shifted 3's in row 0 and mismatches like row 2 [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—shifted right by 1 and wrong values at ends; unknown why exact mismatch but likely min_c off by 1).
 * Train 2: Cropping works for row block but column bounds too narrow, omitting right-side elements (generated row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—missing two 3's on right, extra 3 on left); padding adds zeros incorrectly around incomplete crop.
 * Train 3: Block detection includes wrong rows, leading to row order flip or extra borders (generated row 0 [4,0,4,...] vs expected row 0 [0,4,0,...]—seems like it cropped starting from an offset row and didn't reverse or adjust for alternating pattern).
 * find_main_block is helpful but broken for cases with internal zero rows that should be included (it skips on any zero count row, potentially splitting blocks—e.g., if a structural zero row has count=0 but is part of the object, it's excluded).
 * get_row_bounds and compute_col_bounds are essential and mostly correct but fail when block has varying widths, leading to over-tight crops.
 * pad_dimension and pad_to_square are not broken and helpful for final output, but unhelpful if upstream crop is wrong (don't modify, but ensure crop inputs are accurate).
 * Overall, no extraction of "objects" like connected components was attempted, which might be needed if multiple disjoint parts exist (not in this code, but could be relevant for subtleties like ignoring outliers); current approach assumes single main block.
 * Train 1 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., generated row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—extra 3 and wrong positions, likely from faulty end_r or max_c).
 * No function for connected component analysis or object extraction, which might be unhelpful here since the puzzle seems bounding-box based, not segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped a central 5x13-ish pattern (rows ~3-9 with 3's,5's,4's) but padded excessively to 13x13 with large zero borders, shifting the content downward and not centering it properly (e.g., non-zeros start at row 3, but expected likely tighter crop to rows 4-8, columns ~3-10, padded to ~7x7 square embedded in zeros without the wide empty top/bottom). 
 * It includes symmetric 5's on left/right but mismatches internal structure (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] suggests incomplete column crop, missing connections like the 4 in row 6); this doesn't make sense as a clean extraction—likely wrong min_c/max_c (too wide on sides, too narrow vertically) and over-pads without preserving the "object" shape (e.g., the cross-like 3's and inner 4 seem distorted). 
 * To handle test case, account for multiple horizontal bars (top/bottom 5's, middle 3's) by ensuring block includes all connected non-zeros vertically, even if sparse; current code probably picks a partial block, leading to missing top/bottom elements.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid processing, where the goal is to identify the primary "object" or contiguous region of non-zero values in a 2D grid (likely representing an image or shape), crop it to its tight bounding box, and then pad the result to form a square grid while preserving the content. The output should be a transformed grid that isolates and normalizes the main feature for comparison or rendering.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of rows of integers (0 for empty/background, non-zero for filled/object pixels), and the "object" is defined by contiguous sequences of rows with non-zero counts, ignoring isolated or sparse rows.
 * Focus on the largest contiguous block of rows with any non-zeros to avoid including noise or separate components; subtle elements include handling rows with varying non-zero positions (e.g., irregular shapes) and ensuring column bounds are computed only over the selected rows.
 * Cropping must create a tight bounding box: min/max columns based on the first/last non-zero in each relevant row, but aggregated globally to avoid over-cropping jagged edges.
 * Padding to square should center the content (symmetric or near-symmetric padding with zeros) and handle cases where height and width differ, potentially starting from a 1x1 zero grid if empty.
 * Edge cases: empty grids, all-zero rows/columns, single-row/column objects, or grids where non-zeros don't align perfectly; avoid assuming uniform row lengths or non-negative values.
 * Non-zero values might represent different "colors" or intensities, but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding/cropping; preserve original values in the output.
 * Subtlety: Contiguous blocks reset on zero-count rows, so multiple objects might exist, but only the largest is selected—easy to miss if code doesn't properly scan for max length.
 * Global bounds must initialize correctly (e.g., min_col to infinity or grid width, max_col to -1) to handle rows with no non-zeros within the block.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def count_nonzeros(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is solid for row density; use it to identify active rows.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing; efficiently computes non-zero counts per row.)

```python
def find_largest_contiguous_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_length = 0
    best_start = 0
    current_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            length = i - current_start
            if length > max_length:
                max_length = length
                best_start = current_start
            current_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_length - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This correctly identifies the start/end of the largest run of non-zero-count rows; essential for isolating the main object vertically. Handles edge cases like all-zero grid returning (0,-1) or similar.)

```python
def get_row_first_last(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n  # Initialize to full width (beyond any valid index)
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row horizontal bounds; note initialization of first to n and last to -1 to handle all-zero rows gracefully, where (n, -1) indicates empty.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
(Reliable for extracting subgrid; assumes valid indices and handles empty slices.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    size = max(h, w)
    # Pad columns first if needed
    if w < size:
        pad_left = (size - w) // 2
        pad_right = size - w - pad_left
        for i in range(h):
            grid[i] = [0] * pad_left + grid[i] + [0] * pad_right
        w = size
    # Pad rows if needed
    if h < size:
        pad_top = (size - h) // 2
        pad_bottom = size - h - pad_top
        empty = [0] * size
        for _ in range(pad_top):
            grid.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(pad_bottom):
            grid.append(empty[:])
    return grid
```
(Effective for centering and squaring; handles empty grids and asymmetric padding well, preserving original values.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt demonstrates partial understanding of the puzzle by correctly identifying the need for contiguous row selection, per-row bounds, tight cropping, and square padding, but fails entirely due to a runtime error in all cases.
 * What worked: The vertical block detection (find_largest_contiguous_block) and per-row bounds (get_row_first_last) are logically sound and would isolate the main object if integrated properly; cropping and padding functions execute without issues in isolation.
 * What didn't work: The compute_global_bounds function is broken—it incorrectly initializes min_c as len(bounds[0][0]), where bounds[0][0] is an int (column index), causing "object of type 'int' has no len()" error on all inputs; this prevents any successful execution, so no outputs are generated for analysis.
 * No training examples or test passed; all resulted in the same execution error, indicating the bug blocks the entire pipeline.
 * The approach assumes the largest contiguous non-zero row block is the "object," which aligns with puzzle subtleties (e.g., ignoring noise), but untested due to crash.
 * Function compute_global_bounds is broken and unhelpful in its current form (causes crash; don't use without fixing initialization to something like min_c = float('inf') or grid width, and max_c = -1, then update only if l != -1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to the len() on int bug, so no actual grid is generated—completely incorrect and unusable for verification.
 * Expected test output should be a square-padded bounding box of the main contiguous object (e.g., if test input has a central shape spanning rows 2-5 and columns 3-7, output would crop to that 4x5 region, pad to 5x5 with zeros around, preserving non-zeros); the error prevents any match, and without seeing the input grid, it's unclear if the approach would otherwise align, but the crash confirms it does not produce a valid result.
 * This highlights the need to handle empty or edge rows in bounds aggregation without assuming non-empty tuples.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns (likely representing shapes, figures, or "objects" with pixel values like 3,5,6,8,4 indicating colors or types), where the goal is to extract the "main" or primary figure/object from the input grid, normalize its position (e.g., translate to top-left), compute a bounding box, and output a square grid representation padded with zeros, while ignoring or excluding noise, frames, or secondary elements. The output size is based on the max dimension of the extracted region, but the results suggest the extraction criteria (e.g., row selection, bounding box) are imprecise, leading to inclusions/exclusions of pixels that don't match expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain a "main" figure (dense cluster of non-zero pixels) surrounded by potential noise, frames, or disconnected elements (e.g., sparse lines or dots outside the core shape); the program must identify and isolate only the primary connected or consecutive component, excluding outer frames or isolated pixels.
 * Y-range selection is critical: use consecutive rows with non-zero sums, but prioritize the block with maximum total non-zero pixels to avoid noise; however, subtle disconnected parts (e.g., small protrusions or separate blobs) may need inclusion if part of the main structure, or exclusion if they are artifacts.
 * Bounding box computation must tightly fit the main figure's extent (min/max x/y of non-zeros in selected rows), but avoid expanding to include frame-like borders; translation shifts to (0,0) origin, and output is a square of side max(width, height) of the bbox, padded with zeros—do not return the original n x n size unless s == n.
 * Subtleties include handling asymmetric shapes (e.g., figures not centered), multiple potential "main" blocks (select largest by sum or area), and ensuring no pixel values are altered during extraction/translation—only positions change.
 * Noise handling: Grids may have zero-rows or sparse rows above/below/around the main figure; do not include them in the y-range or bbox unless they connect to the main structure.
 * Output must preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within the extracted region; mismatches often occur in top/bottom rows (e.g., extra 3s included as noise) or side alignments (e.g., shifted 8s or 6s).
 * Consider connected components: The main figure may not be fully rectangular; use row_bounds to find per-row min/max x, but aggregate carefully to avoid over-expansion.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return zero-filled n x n; if no main block, output zeros; varying grid sizes (10x10 or 13x13) mean s can be < n, leading to smaller outputs implicitly padded in display.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect y-range (including noise rows) or bbox (missing/extruding parts), resulting in shifted or incomplete figures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several modular functions for row analysis and extraction, which are partially useful for identifying and isolating regions but need refinement for accurate main figure selection (e.g., better y-range logic or component detection). No new types are defined, but Tuple[int, int] for bounds and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for pixels (y,x,value) are effective for handling positions and values.

The main `program` function composes these but is flawed in y-range/bbox selection; no explicit object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) is present, which might be needed for complex shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (all training examples failed); it correctly implements modular extraction/translation/padding but fails on core selection logic.
 * What worked: Pixel extraction preserves values; translation to (0,0) normalizes position; square padding handles varying bbox sizes; row_sums and row_bounds efficiently identify dense regions without full scans.
 * What didn't work: Y-range selection via max-sum consecutive rows includes noise (e.g., top/bottom sparse rows with 3s in train1), leading to bbox that captures extras; no handling for disconnected components or frames, causing over-inclusion; output size s often matches n but with misplaced pixels due to wrong min_y/max_y.
 * Train1: Generated includes extra 3s in row0 (positions 2,4) and row12 (3s at 3,4), but expected has 3s at 3 and 10 in row0, and 3s at 5 and 7 in row12; inner figure (8s,6s) is shifted/missing parts (e.g., generated row2 has 8s at 2-3 but expected at 3; row10 has 8s at 8-9 but expected at 9 missing); overall, figure is vertically expanded with noise, horizontally misaligned (unknown reason, possibly bbox min_x too low).
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 at 3 but expected all 0s except row1 3 at 6; row3 has 3s at 1-2 but expected 3 at 2; row4 has 5 at 0,3 at 2 but expected 5 at 0,3s at 1-2; row5 matches somewhat but row6 has 4s missing in expected positions; figure is incomplete/shifted rightward, with extra 3s in noise rows (e.g., row1), suggesting wrong y-range including top noise.
 * Train3: Generated row0/1 are [4,0,4,...]/[0,4,0,...] but expected swapped to [0,4,0,...]/[4,0,4,...], indicating possible rotation or frame misextraction; inner 1s/2s are misplaced (e.g., generated row2 has 1 at 5 but expected row2 all 0s except 1s at 3-4; row4 has 2s at 4-5 but expected row4 2s at 4-5 ok, but surrounding 1s wrong); frame is included but inverted, inner figure vertically shifted down by ~1 row (unknown reason, likely y-range starts too early).
 * Function `get_main_bbox` is helpful but broken when y-range is noisy (propagates errors); `find_main_y_range` is essential but insufficient (needs connectivity or size threshold); no unhelpful functions, but the composition in `program` assumes single main block—add component detection for multi-blob grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of normalization but misses subtle noise exclusion and precise component isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it extracts a partial figure (5s on sides, 3s/4s in middle) but places it starting from row1 (with row0 as [0s,3,3,0s] like noise or bottom fragment), repeats the pattern in rows1-2/4-5 but inverts or shifts (e.g., row2 has 3s at 4-8 but test input row? has different), adds isolated 3 in row6 middle, then pads with 7+ zero rows— this suggests wrong y-range (included top noise, excluded bottom?), incomplete bbox (missing left/right alignments, e.g., 5s at 0-1 and 11-12 but 3s not centered), and over-padding without centering. Expected likely a tight square of the central cross-like figure (3s horizontal, 4s vertical-ish, framed by 5s) translated to top-left without extras, possibly 7x7 or similar s<13, but output bloats to 13x13 with misplaced elements (e.g., duplicated rows 1/5 and 2/4 indicate loop error or wrong min_y). It fails to isolate the main "plus" shape, including apparent noise 3s, and doesn't match a clean normalized output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting the "main" visual object or pattern from a sparse grid by identifying the bounding box of non-zero cells across relevant rows (not necessarily strictly consecutive), cropping to that subgrid, and then centering it within a square grid via symmetric padding with zeros, preserving the relative structure and values of the original content. The goal is to isolate and normalize the core artwork or symbol while ignoring outer noise or framing, but ensuring no distortion of internal zeros or shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main object" may span rows that are not fully consecutive non-zero counts; isolated zero rows within the object's vertical extent must be included if they are part of the bounding structure (e.g., gaps in patterns like letters or symbols), so the row selection should use the overall min-max row bounds of non-zeros rather than the longest consecutive block.
 * Column cropping must use the tightest bounding box across the selected rows, but padding must be centered (symmetric left/right, top/bottom) to maintain visual alignment, and the target square size should be based on the max of the cropped height/width without over-trimming internal structure.
 * Subtle elements include preserving exact non-zero values (e.g., 3,8,6) and their positions, including internal zeros that define shapes (e.g., holes in blobs); over-cropping can merge or shift these, leading to mismatches.
 * Grids may have outer zero framing or noise (e.g., stray non-zeros), which should be excluded; the output is always square, but size varies based on content (e.g., 13x13 for Train1, 10x10 for Train2/3).
 * Handle empty or all-zero inputs by returning a minimal [[0]] or similar, but real cases have clear central patterns.
 * Padding must not introduce asymmetry; use integer division for even/odd splits to center properly.
 * Non-zero count per row helps identify active rows, but the block-finding logic fails when the object has vertical gaps (common in puzzles like ASCII art or pixel drawings).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements row non-zero counting, per-row bounds, subgrid cropping, and centered padding to square, which works for dense objects without gaps (e.g., partial credit for column alignment in some cases).
 * Failed to select the full vertical extent of the object by using longest consecutive non-zero row block, excluding necessary gapped zero rows (e.g., in Train1, cropped rows 1-11 excluding top/bottom framing, leading to shifted content and mismatched shapes like extra 3's in row 0 col 2 vs. expected zero).
 * In Train1, generated output includes incorrect values/positions (e.g., row 2 has [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] but expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...]; row 5 has [0,3,8,8,6,6,...] but expected [3,3,8,8,6,6,...]—unknown reason for vertical shift/misalignment, possibly from wrong start_r).
 * Train2 generated mismatches in internal structure (e.g., row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], adding extra 3's and shifting 4's; row 4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs. expected [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0], wrong blob connectivity).
 * Train3 generated flips or misaligns patterns (e.g., row 0 [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]; entire top/bottom borders swapped, and internal 1/2 placements off like row 2 [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4]).
 * find_longest_block function is broken for gapped objects (assumes consecutive density, misses full height); not helpful for this puzzle—replace with overall min/max row of any non-zero.
 * No object extraction beyond density; lacks function to find global min/max row/col of all non-zeros, which would fix row selection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped too narrowly vertically (content only in rows 3-8 of 13, with symmetric zero padding top/bottom, but likely excludes parts of a taller object with gaps, similar to Train failures).
 * It centers a sub-pattern (e.g., 3's and 5's forming a shape with 4's inside), but the full 13x13 suggests the object spans more rows (e.g., top/bottom 5's and 3's may connect via sparse rows), leading to potential misalignment if gapped rows like row 3/9 are omitted.
 * Horizontal cropping seems okay (tight around cols 3-10), but vertical misses full extent (e.g., if test has framing like Train1, output should include more zero-gapped rows for correct shape like a letter or symbol).
 * Padding to 13x13 is oversized if object is smaller, but makes sense if global bounds are used; however, the isolated central block ignores potential outer connections, making the output incomplete (e.g., top/bottom rows all zero except possibly stray, but expected likely has adjusted framing).

**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers (likely representing a visual image or diagram with different "colors" or elements via numbers like 3,8,6) to extract and isolate the main central "object" or figure by cropping to its tight bounding box and then padding with zeros to form a centered square grid of appropriate size. The goal is to remove extraneous border or empty space while preserving the structure of the core content, ensuring the output matches the expected cropped and padded form exactly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main object may not occupy every row or column fully, so cropping must use the minimal bounding box that encloses all non-zero elements of the object without including irrelevant outer zeros or disconnected elements.
 * Padding must be centered (symmetric where possible, with even/odd distribution) both horizontally and vertically to make the grid square, using the maximum of the cropped height and width as the target size.
 * Non-zero counts per row are useful for identifying dense regions, but the "max sum nonzero block" must consider the actual connected or primary object, not just any consecutive dense rows—subtleties include handling objects that span irregular rows (e.g., with sparse rows in between) or have protrusions that affect column bounds.
 * Column bounds should be computed only over the selected rows to avoid including distant non-zeros outside the main object.
 * The grid may have symmetric borders or frames (e.g., repeating patterns like 3's or 5's around the edges), which should be excluded if they are not part of the core figure.
 * Subtle elements: Objects can have internal zeros (holes or gaps) that should be preserved, but the bounding box ignores them for cropping; ensure no shearing, shifting, or alteration of values during crop/pad.
 * All non-zero elements in the output must match positions and values exactly from the input's main object; extraneous non-zeros (e.g., from borders) lead to mismatches.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids default to [[0]]; objects may not be rectangular, so tight bounds are key; padding adds zeros only outside the crop.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_count(row: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [row_nonzero_count(row) for row in g]
```
These are helpful for identifying dense rows to locate potential object regions.

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds

def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, n_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
These are partially helpful for computing per-row and aggregate column bounds to define the crop area accurately.

```python
def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped

def pad_columns(cropped: List[List[int]], target_width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_width = len(cropped[0])
    if current_width >= target_width:
        return cropped
    col_pad_left = (target_width - current_width) // 2
    col_pad_right = target_width - current_width - col_pad_left
    for r in range(len(cropped)):
        cropped[r] = [0] * col_pad_left + cropped[r] + [0] * col_pad_right
    return cropped

def pad_rows(cropped: List[List[int]], target_size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_height = len(cropped)
    if current_height >= target_size:
        return cropped
    row_pad_top = (target_size - current_height) // 2
    row_pad_bottom = target_size - current_height - row_pad_top
    size = len(cropped[0])
    for _ in range(row_pad_top):
        cropped.insert(0, [0] * size)
    for _ in range(row_pad_bottom):
        cropped.append([0] * size)
    return cropped

def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped or not cropped[0]:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    s = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_columns(cropped, s)
    cropped = pad_rows(cropped, s)
    return cropped
```
These cropping and padding functions are helpful and correctly implement tight bounding box extraction and centered square padding, but they depend on accurate row/column selection upstream.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements bounding box cropping and centered padding to square, which preserves internal structure and adds zeros appropriately, but fails because row selection via max consecutive nonzero sum includes extraneous rows (e.g., top/bottom borders with partial non-zeros).
 * In training example 1, generated includes extra top/bottom rows with misplaced 3's (e.g., generated row 0: [0,0,3,0,3,0,...] vs expected row 0: [0,0,0,3,0,0,...]) and shifts internal elements (e.g., row 2 generated [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]), likely due to wrong row start/end and column bounds including border artifacts; bottom row also mismatches (generated [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]).
 * In training example 2, generated crops too tightly or shifts columns, omitting some 3's and 4's (e.g., generated row 3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected row 3: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], missing right-side 3's and altering 5 positions); also includes top row non-zeros incorrectly while expected has more zeros there.
 * In training example 3, generated starts with wrong row order (e.g., generated row 0: [4,0,4,0,...] vs expected row 0: [0,4,0,4,...]), indicating failure to identify the correct starting row for the object, and internal mismatches like row 2 generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] show shifted or incomplete bounds.
 * The find_max_sum_nonzero_block function is broken/not helpful as it assumes consecutive dense rows define the object, but puzzles have non-consecutive or bordered elements, leading to over-inclusion; don't use it in future without refinement to detect the primary connected component.
 * Overall, the approach demonstrates partial understanding of cropping/padding but misses identifying the exact main object bounds, treating borders as part of the figure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 square with the main content (3's,5's,4's forming what seems like a figure or letter) centered in rows 4-8 and columns 4-8, but padded heavily with outer zeros, which may be too loose—likely the expected is a tighter crop to just the non-zero block (e.g., 5x5 or similar square without the large empty borders), as the current method includes empty rows/columns from the input's sparse layout, mismatching the training expectations where tighter, object-focused squares are produced without extraneous space.
 * It incorrectly assumes the entire input height needs full padding to 13x13, but the object appears confined to a smaller central area (rows ~3-8, cols ~3-9), so the output bloats the grid unnecessarily and may shift positions if bounds are off, similar to training failures.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:51:59] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns (likely representing images, letters, or shapes with numbers as pixel values/colors), where the goal is to extract, crop, and center the "main" non-zero pattern into a square grid while preserving the relative structure, but the current program fails to align or crop correctly, leading to shifts, distortions, or incorrect bounding in all cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main pattern is defined by a contiguous block of rows with non-zero elements, but cropping must use a global bounding box (min/max columns across the entire block) rather than per-row tight bounds, to avoid row-specific shifts that misalign the pattern horizontally.
 * Padding must be centered both horizontally (per row) and vertically (adding zero rows), but the square size s should be based on the maximum of the block height and the global width of the pattern, ensuring the entire structure fits without distortion or overflow.
 * Expected outputs maintain the original relative positions of non-zero elements within the pattern, with symmetric zero-padding to form a square; subtle asymmetries in the input (e.g., uneven non-zero distributions) must be preserved, not "corrected" by aggressive per-row cropping.
 * Grids may have sparse or irregular borders/noise (e.g., isolated zeros or small non-zero outliers outside the main block), which should be ignored by focusing only on the densest contiguous non-zero row sequence.
 * Output size varies by input (e.g., 13x13 for train1, 10x10 for others), suggesting s is dynamically computed as max(height_of_block, width_of_global_bounds), not fixed.
 * Numbers (e.g., 3,8,6 in train1; 5,3,4 in train2) represent distinct "colors" or shape elements and must not be altered—only positions adjusted via cropping/padding.
 * Potential noise: Inputs may have all-zero rows/columns that act as borders, but the main pattern might not span the full grid width/height, requiring tight global extraction without including empty space inside the bounds.
 * Vertical centering adds zero rows top/bottom, but horizontal centering per row must align to the global structure, not independently shift elements.
 * Subtle element: In train1 expected, the bottom-right has [0,3,3] while generated has [0,3,0], indicating failure to preserve exact intra-pattern spacing; similarly, train2 expected shifts some rows (e.g., row3 has [0,0,3,...] vs generated [3,3,0,...]), suggesting the program over-crops or misaligns left edges.
 * Train3 shows rotation-like shifts (e.g., expected starts rows with [0,4,...] alternating, generated with [4,0,...]), hinting at possible orientation or alignment rules, but likely just bounding box issues.
 * All examples have even/odd symmetries in padding, so integer division for left/right/top/bottom must floor consistently to avoid off-center results.
 * Considerations from attempts: Longest contiguous block works for vertical extraction (avoids top/bottom noise), but combining with per-row bounds causes horizontal misalignment; global col min/max across block would fix this.

            current_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_len - 1

```
These are helpful for identifying the vertical bounds of the main pattern (longest non-zero row block), as they correctly isolate the core content in all examples.

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Computes the min and max non-zero column indices for each row (tight bounds per row)."""
    if not g:
        return []
    n_cols = len(g[0])
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
This is partially helpful for per-row analysis but broken for the puzzle—using it leads to misalignment; modify to compute global min/max across the block instead.

```python
def pad_row_to_size(row: List[int], size: int) -> List[int]:
    """Pads a single row centered with zeros to the target size."""
    curr_w = len(row)
    if curr_w >= size:
        return row
    left = (size - curr_w) // 2
    right = size - curr_w - left
    return [0] * left + row + [0] * right

def pad_rows_centered(rows: List[List[int]], size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Pads the grid vertically centered with zero rows to the target size."""
    curr_h = len(rows)
    if curr_h >= size:
        return rows
    top = (size - curr_h) // 2
    bottom = size - curr_h - top
    zero_row = [0] * len(rows[0]) if rows else [0] * size
    padded = [zero_row[:] for _ in range(top)] + rows + [zero_row[:] for _ in range(bottom)]
    return padded
```
These are helpful for centering (both horizontal and vertical), as expected outputs show symmetric zero-padding; they work correctly when applied after proper global cropping.

The main `program` function is not helpful overall—it's broken due to per-row cropping causing shifts; do not reuse without replacing `get_row_bounds` and `compute_max_tight_width` with global versions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the vertical main block (longest contiguous non-zero rows) and applies centered padding, which isolates the core height in all trainings (e.g., skips top/bottom noise in train1 and train2).
 * However, per-row tight cropping misaligns horizontal positions, leading to left-shifts or distortions (e.g., in train1, generated row2 starts with [3,3,8,...] but expected [0,3,0,...], preserving a leading zero gap; unknown why the program fills/omits these gaps).
 * Train1 mismatches multiple rows: generated row0 [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0] (generated has incorrect internal 3 placements); row4 generated [0,3,0,8,0,0,6,0,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,0,6,0,0,8,0,3,3] (missing trailing 3); row12 generated [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 and wrong positions).
 * Train2 mismatches row3: generated [3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5,0] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5] (generated left-shifts and alters structure); row4 generated [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs expected [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0] (missing elements and shifts); row5 has extra 4 in expected middle.
 * Train3 mismatches orientations: generated rows alternate starting with 4 but expected alternates with 0/4 (e.g., row0 generated [4,0,4,...] vs expected [0,4,0,...]); row2 generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] (leading 4 vs 0, and internal shifts); this suggests the program doesn't handle global left-padding correctly.
 * All trainings fail due to horizontal misalignment from per-row bounds; vertical block detection works but isn't enough alone.
 * No object extraction function was used (none provided beyond bounds), but a global_bounds function would be essential to compute min_col = min(first for first,_ in bounds[start:end+1]), max_col = max(last for _,last in bounds[start:end+1]), then slice all rows[start:end+1] to [min_col:max_col+1] before padding.
 * compute_max_tight_width is unhelpful/broken— it maxes per-row widths but ignores global alignment; replace with global width computation.
 * Padding functions are correct but applied too early/after bad cropping, causing the square to embed a distorted pattern.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it extracts a 13x13 grid with the main pattern (rows with 3,4,5) vertically centered but horizontally left-aligned and over-padded with zeros, creating a sparse, non-symmetric result (e.g., row4 [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] starts with two 5s but expected likely needs global crop to center the inner 3/4/5 shape without leading/trailing excesses).
 * It includes the full input width (13 cols) for non-cropped rows but pads others, leading to inconsistency (e.g., row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] is too narrow and right-shifted relative to row4); this mismatches the tight, centered expectations from trainings.
 * The output has excessive top/bottom zeros (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zero), suggesting vertical padding is applied but the block detection might include empty rows or fail to tighten height; the pattern looks like a centered "object" with borders but distorted (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] has isolated 4 not aligned with trainings' symmetries).
 * To handle test case, must use global horizontal bounds across the detected row block (likely rows 3-9), crop all to that width (e.g., cols 2-10 or similar for the 3/4/5 core), pad to s=max(7,9?)=9 or whatever fits, then vertically center in 9x9—but current 13x13 is wrong size, indicating s computation fails when max_w < input width.

[2025-10-03 14:51:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to crop a grid to focus on the "main" or central non-zero content (likely a symbol, digit, or pattern formed by numbers like 3, 5, 6, 8 representing filled pixels or segments), then pad it symmetrically with zeros to form a square grid of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, while preserving the relative positions and ensuring alignment matches the expected output. The process involves identifying contiguous rows with significant non-zero activity, computing tight column bounds within those rows, cropping, and centering via padding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping must use the tightest bounding box around the main object, but only for contiguous rows that form the core pattern—do not include isolated border rows or rows with minimal/sparse non-zeros if they are not part of the contiguous block, as this can shift the content left/right or include/exclude elements incorrectly.
 * Padding must be centered (even distribution on top/bottom and left/right), but the side length is the max of cropped height/width; however, if the input is already square-like, avoid over-padding or shifting the content asymmetrically.
 * Subtle element: The "main" row for starting the crop is the one with the highest non-zero count, but the contiguous block must extend only to rows where counts >0 without skipping zeros inside the object (but zeros inside are okay if part of the pattern); overlooking internal zero rows within the object can truncate it.
 * Grids may have border-like zeros or sparse rows (e.g., single non-zeros) that should be excluded from the crop to avoid including "frames" or artifacts, but the expected outputs sometimes retain specific sparse elements if they are integral to the pattern's edges.
 * Column bounds must be computed per the selected row range, but min/max columns should ignore empty rows within the range—easy to miss if bounds include padding from empty sub-rows.
 * Patterns involve numbers (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6/4/5 for fills), so treat all non-zero as "filled" for counting/bounds, but preserve exact values in output.
 * Inputs are rectangular lists of lists, outputs must be square and exactly match expected row-by-row, including zero placements.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return [[0]]; sparse patterns may require manual adjustment if auto-contiguous misses disconnected but related parts (though examples suggest patterns are contiguous).
 * From attempts: Row extension (start/end) works for dense centers but fails if the max-count row is not perfectly centered in the object, leading to asymmetric crops; padding functions are correct but applied after wrong crop, causing shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_count(row: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [row_nonzero_count(row) for row in g]

def find_max_count_row(counts: List[int]) -> int:
    if not counts:
        return 0
    max_i = 0
    max_c = counts[0]
    for i in range(1, len(counts)):
        if counts[i] > max_c:
            max_c = counts[i]
            max_i = i
    return max_i

def find_start_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    s = start
    while s > 0 and counts[s - 1] > 0:
        s -= 1
    return s

def find_end_row(counts: List[int], start: int) -> int:
    e = start
    n = len(counts)
    while e < n - 1 and counts[e + 1] > 0:
        e += 1
    return e
```
These are helpful for identifying the core row range based on non-zero density.

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds

def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, n_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c

def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
These are useful for per-row and aggregate bounds, and basic cropping; they correctly compute min/max but fail if row range is wrong.

```python
def pad_columns(cropped: List[List[int]], target_width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_width = len(cropped[0])
    if current_width >= target_width:
        return cropped
    col_pad_left = (target_width - current_width) // 2
    col_pad_right = target_width - current_width - col_pad_left
    for r in range(len(cropped)):
        cropped[r] = [0] * col_pad_left + cropped[r] + [0] * col_pad_right
    return cropped

def pad_rows(cropped: List[List[int]], target_size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_height = len(cropped)
    if current_height >= target_size:
        return cropped
    row_pad_top = (target_size - current_height) // 2
    row_pad_bottom = target_size - current_height - row_pad_top
    size = len(cropped[0])
    for _ in range(row_pad_top):
        cropped.insert(0, [0] * size)
    for _ in range(row_pad_bottom):
        cropped.append([0] * size)
    return cropped
```
These handle symmetric padding well and are not broken—use them after fixing crop.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies the max non-zero row and extends to contiguous non-zero rows, which works for dense central patterns but fails when the object has internal zero-count rows or when sparse edge rows (e.g., borders) should be excluded, leading to over-inclusion of empty space.
 * Cropping via row/column bounds is mostly right but computes min/max too broadly within the row range, including outliers from sparse rows, causing left-shifted content (e.g., in Train 1, generated row 0 has 3's at positions 2 and 4, but expected at 3 and 10, indicating wrong column start).
 * Padding to square is correct in logic (centered, max(h,w) side), but since crop is wrong, the final grid has shifted/misaligned patterns—e.g., Train 1 generated includes extra left zeros and wrong placements in rows 2-10 compared to expected (e.g., generated row 2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...], missing leading zeros and altering 3/8 positions).
 * Train 2 mismatches in row 1 (generated [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0], wrong 3 position) and row 3 (generated [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], extra 3's and shifted), suggesting column bounds grabbed too wide or wrong row range excluded top sparse rows.
 * Train 3 mismatches entirely in row ordering and content—generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips even/odd rows ([0,4,0,...] first), indicating the contiguous row finder or crop ignored the alternating border pattern, treating it as non-contiguous or wrong start row.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond bounds; a function to detect connected components (e.g., flood-fill for blobs) might help if patterns have disconnected parts, but current attempt lacks this—consider adding for future if contiguity fails.
 * The overall program(g) handles empty cases well but defaults to full grid crop if bounds fail, which over-pads without centering the true object.
 * Function `program` integrates everything but is broken due to row range logic—don't reuse without fixing start/end finders to skip zero-count rows outside the main block.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to crop/pad the entire input grid (13x13) with minimal trimming, resulting in large zero borders (e.g., rows 0-2 and 9-12 all zeros, content squeezed in rows 3-8 but shifted right with uneven columns, like 5's at edges but 3/4 patterns not centered). 
 * Compared to mentally running rules: The test input has a central cross-like pattern with 5's on sides, 3's in middle rows/columns, and a 4 in row 6 col 6; correct output should crop tightly to rows ~3-8 (height 6), columns ~3-9 (width 7, side=7), pad to 7x7 centered (e.g., add 0.5 rows top/bottom, 0 left/1 right), preserving exact 3/4/5 positions without the full 13x13 bloat or left/right shifts seen in generated (e.g., generated row 4: [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] includes outer 5's but expected would trim them if borders, centering the inner 3's and single 4).
 * It makes sense as a failed full-grid pad but not as correct extraction—missing tight crop leads to oversized zeros, and content alignment (e.g., 5's too far left in generated row 4) doesn't match a centered pattern; unknown why it didn't trim columns better, but likely because col_bounds took min_c=0 from edge 5's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely pixel art or ASCII-like representations with numbers as colors/values) where the goal is to extract or crop the "main object" or central content from a larger grid that includes borders, frames, or extraneous zero-padded areas. The extraction should produce a subgrid that matches the expected "clean" or bounded version of the object, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while trimming surrounding zeros appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid always has fixed dimensions (e.g., 20 columns in example 1, 10 in others), but the main object does not span the full width or height; borders often consist of patterned zeros or repeating non-zeros (e.g., 3's or 5's forming frames).
 * Non-zero rows are not always fully consecutive; there may be isolated zero rows at the top/bottom that should be excluded, but the "longest block" approach misses cases where the object has internal zero rows or irregular shapes.
 * Column cropping must account for the tightest bounding box per row group, but min/max columns are calculated per row in the block—subtleties include asymmetric objects where left/right edges vary, and zeros within the object should be preserved (not trimmed internally).
 * Objects may have "legs" or extensions (e.g., in example 1, the bottom row has sparse 3's that differ in generated vs. expected), requiring per-row min/max rather than global for the block.
 * All examples show symmetric or framed structures (e.g., 5's as borders in example 2, 4's in example 3), so extraction should ignore outer frames and focus on inner content; however, frames may integrate with the object (e.g., 3's in example 1 seem part of the object).
 * Expected outputs preserve some leading/trailing zeros within rows to maintain shape (e.g., example 1 expected has [0,0,0,3,0,0,...] vs. generated [0,0,3,0,3,...]), indicating no global left-trimming—crop to the union of all non-zero positions across the relevant rows.
 * Subtle element: The "object" may span nearly all rows but exclude thin top/bottom zero rows; in example 3, the object is rotated or checkerboard-patterned, and extraction flips or reorders rows/columns incorrectly.
 * Consider connectivity: Non-zeros may form disconnected blobs, but examples suggest extracting the primary connected component (e.g., ignore small isolated elements).
 * Height of extracted grid varies (13 rows in example 1, 10 in others), so dynamically determine start/end rows based on first/last non-all-zero rows, not just longest block.
 * Numbers represent colors/types (e.g., 3=one type, 8=another), so preserve exact values; zeros are background.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a longest consecutive non-zero row block to determine height, which worked partially for examples 1 and 2 (captured most rows) but failed in example 3 by including extra patterned rows (e.g., generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected starts with [0,4,0,...], indicating wrong row order or selection).
 * Global min/max column calculation worked for rough width in example 1 (13 cols output) but produced incorrect content: e.g., train 1 generated first row [0,0,3,0,3,0,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,...], missing a leading zero and including an extra 3 early—likely due to min_c=1 instead of 3, shifting the slice left.
 * In train 2, generated included extraneous elements like [0,3,3,0,4,...] in row 4 vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], showing the uniform slice didn't align with the inner object's varying left edges (e.g., expected has more leading zeros in some rows).
 * Train 3 generated a near-full grid but mismatched row order and content: e.g., first row [4,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,...], and internal rows like generated [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—suggests the block finder took wrong start/end, and column slicing ignored the checkerboard symmetry.
 * The has_non_zero function is solid and essential for row detection.
 * find_longest_block is partially helpful but broken for gapped or framed objects (e.g., misses that example 3 has alternating non-zero rows throughout).
 * find_min_col and find_max_col are flawed—not helpful as-is, since they compute global bounds but objects need per-row trimming or union bounds that preserve internal spacing; using them leads to shifted or squished outputs.
 * Overall program demonstrates basic bounding box understanding but ignores frame detection and per-row variation, causing all mismatches; no object extraction beyond crude cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same flawed longest-block + global min/max column slicing, producing 7 rows of width 13, but the content shows irregular 5's and 3's that seem like a partial frame or object (e.g., first row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,...] suggests top border, but middle rows like [5,5,0,3,3,3,...] include outer 5's that may be frame elements to exclude).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: e.g., symmetric 5-borders in rows 2,4,6 suggest the output included frame instead of cropping to inner 3/4 content; the sparse bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,...] looks like it trimmed too much vertically, missing potential object extensions.
 * The output has varying non-zero positions (e.g., 3's clustered in cols 5-9, 5's on edges), indicating the global slice shifted everything left (min_c too low), distorting the shape—likely incorrect as it doesn't preserve the "clean" inner object seen in training expecteds.
 * No way to confirm exact expected without rules, but it fails to handle frame-like 5's (similar to train 2's borders), so probably needs frame detection or better row selection to exclude top/bottom zeros properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving sparse grids of integers (likely representing colored cells or patterns), where the goal is to extract a cropped subgrid that captures the "main" figure or object while removing extraneous empty (zero) borders or padding, resulting in a tighter, possibly rectangular bounding area around the non-zero content. The extraction should preserve the relative positions and values of non-zero cells but trim outer empty rows/columns to focus on the core pattern, without forcing a square shape or including unnecessary whitespace.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids are often large (e.g., 18x18 or 19x19) with significant empty (zero) areas on the borders, especially left/right columns and top/bottom rows; the output must crop these dynamically to the minimal or near-minimal bounding rectangle enclosing all non-zero cells, but not so aggressively that internal zeros (part of the pattern) are removed.
 * Outputs are rectangular, not necessarily square—e.g., training example 1 expects 13x13 but with irregular non-zero distribution; forcing square shapes (as in the current program) leads to oversized or misaligned extractions that include padding.
 * Non-zero cells form connected or semi-connected "objects" (e.g., borders, shapes like 3's, 8's, 6's in train1; 5's, 3's, 4's in train2; 4's and inner patterns in train3), and the extraction should encompass the largest or primary object without fragmenting it or including disconnected outliers.
 * Internal zeros within the pattern must be preserved (e.g., gaps in shapes), but outer pure-zero rows/columns should be trimmed; subtle elements include asymmetric padding (more empty on left in train1) and potential for multiple disjoint objects (e.g., small isolated cells in test input like bottom-right 5's).
 * The puzzle may involve identifying a "frame" or border (e.g., alternating 4's in train3) as part of the core pattern, so cropping shouldn't remove structural edges unless they are fully empty.
 * Grids can have varying sizes, so the program must compute bounds dynamically rather than hardcoding; consider row/column spans of non-zeros, but account for cases where the "main" object doesn't span the full height/width (e.g., train2 has empty middle rows in output? No, output includes them if part of bounds).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs can have leading/trailing zeros in rows if they are part of the pattern's edge (e.g., train1 row1 starts/ends with zeros), but entire rows/columns of zeros on the perimeter should be omitted; also, rotation or reordering (seen in train3 mismatch) isn't needed—extraction is positional cropping.
 * Across attempts (only one shown, but implied iterations): Prioritize bounding box over density; handle varying grid sizes without assuming square; avoid maximizing non-zeros in a square, as it grabs too-wide areas with padding (e.g., train1 includes 5+ left zeros per row).

    return [[g[i][j] for j in range(start_col, end_col)] for i in range(start_row, end_row)]
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `find_largest_square_block`: Broken for this puzzle—forces square (w == h) and maximizes non-zero count within it, leading to padded or oversized extractions (e.g., grabs full-width with left zeros in train1); ignores rectangular bounds and includes empty rows/columns; not relevant, as puzzle outputs aren't strictly square.
 * Current `program`: Relies on square finder, so always fails on asymmetric patterns; extracts too much padding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown uses a square-focused approach, which worked partially by identifying dense non-zero areas (e.g., captured most of the 3/8/6 patterns in train1) but failed by including excessive left/top/bottom padding zeros, resulting in oversized/wider outputs (18 cols vs. expected 13 in train1; 15 vs. 10 in train2).
 * Train1: Generated a near-full grid with 5+ leading zeros per row and extra bottom empty rows, mismatching expected cropped version (starts trimming at col 3, ends at col 15-ish, removes left empty block); unknown why it picked h=11 starting at row 0, but it over-included empties; nz maximization grabbed too-wide span (min_c=6, w=11? but still padded).
 * Train2: Generated included extra left/right empties and mismatched row lengths (15 vs. 10), capturing 5/3/4 patterns but with padding (e.g., leading zeros in rows); failed to crop tightly around the central object, adding irrelevant empty rows at bottom.
 * Train3: Generated almost the full 10x10 but with rows 1-2 swapped and inner pattern misaligned (e.g., row3 has [4,0,0,0,0,1,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,...]), suggesting wrong start/min_col (perhaps picked h=10, s=0, min_c=0 including border but shifting?); close in size but positionally wrong, missing subtle inner crop.
 * extract_subgrid is mostly helpful but limited to square (h-wide); get_nonzero_cols_per_row is essential for span detection but underused (only for min/max col, not full bounds).
 * Overall: Missed rectangular cropping; considered density over bounds; no handling for asymmetric empties; train samples all failed due to padding inclusion; function forcing square is incorrect (don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it extracts a very wide (19 cols?) rectangular strip starting from the left, including massive empty padding (e.g., rows 1-5 have 3-18 leading zeros before any non-zero like 5 or 3), and captures disjoint elements (top-left 3's, mid-right 5's block, bottom 3/4/5 patterns) without tight cropping, resulting in a sparse, non-focused grid that doesn't isolate a "main" figure.
 * It mismatches what a correct output should be: mentally, the test input has a small top-left 3/5 cluster (rows 0-4, cols 0-3), a mid-right 5's block (rows 6-8, cols 11-14), a large bottom-center 3/4/5 object (rows 10-14, cols 6-17), and scattered bottom 5's (rows 17-18); a correct extraction likely needs to bound the largest/dominant object (bottom 3/4/5, ~5x12), cropping to ~ rows 10-15, cols 6-18, yielding a tighter 6x13 with preserved internals, not the full padded mess; current output includes irrelevant top empties and doesn't focus, making it look like a raw dump rather than a puzzle solution.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of numbers (likely representing pixel-like patterns or objects with different values like 3,5,8,4,6,1,2 indicating colors, shapes, or densities), where the goal is to automatically detect, extract, and isolate the "main" or central patterned object(s) by cropping to their bounding box and padding to a square grid, while removing extraneous empty space, noise, or secondary elements. The output must match the expected clean, centered square representations exactly, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements within the object.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids contain multiple potential "objects" or patterns (e.g., scattered numbers like 3's forming borders, 8's in shapes, 5's in lines), but only the primary cohesive one(s) should be extracted—secondary or isolated elements (e.g., lone 8's at the bottom in training example 1, or small 3's/4's in example 2) must be omitted to avoid bloating the output.
 * Extraction involves identifying a contiguous block of rows and columns that tightly bounds the main object, not just the densest rows via sum of non-zeros; subtle connections (e.g., via adjacent non-zeros) or visual coherence (e.g., forming a recognizable shape like a figure or symbol) should guide selection, as pure density (Kadane's) misses vertically sparse but connected parts.
 * Padding must center the cropped object in a square of size equal to the max dimension of the crop, using zeros; however, over-padding or including empty rows/columns leads to mismatched sizes (e.g., generated outputs often have 19x19 with excessive zeros, while expected are smaller like 13x13 or 10x10).
 * Non-zero values must be preserved exactly (no alteration), and the output grid must be rectangular lists of lists, but represented as square after padding; subtle elements include handling irregular shapes where first/last non-zero columns vary per row, requiring global min/max bounds per block, but avoiding blocks that include disconnected noise.
 * Grids may have varying sizes (e.g., 19x19 in example 1, 17x17 in example 2), with empty borders or padding already present; extraction should ignore outer zeros but detect if the main object spans most of the grid or is offset.
 * Connected components (e.g., 4-connected or 8-connected non-zeros) might be key to identify "objects" rather than row sums, as current method grabs loose contiguous rows including gaps.
 * Edge cases: All-zero grids return [[0]]; single-object grids need tight crop; multiple objects require selecting the largest/coherent one (e.g., in example 3, ignore top scattered 1's and 4's, focus on central patterned block).
 * Outputs are shown as flattened rows but are 2D lists; mismatches often in size (too big) or content (extra zeros/noise included).

    # ... (code as provided, but flawed logic for if counts[i] > max_current + counts[i], which is always true if counts[i] > 0; buggy comparison)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by selecting overly broad row blocks via flawed Kadane's on row non-zero sums, leading to inclusion of empty or sparse rows (e.g., in training 1, generated a 19x19 with bottom empty rows and side zeros, while expected is 13x13 tight crop of central 3/8/6 pattern; difference: extra padding and missed tight row 2-12 crop, omitting bottom 8's correctly but bloating size).
 * In training 2, generated scattered 5/3/4 elements across a large zero-padded grid, including isolated top/bottom parts, while expected is 10x10 tight extraction of central 5/3/4 shape; difference: wrong row selection (e.g., included row 2 with single 5, but expected starts from denser block), resulting in disconnected output.
 * In training 3, generated a mess with top scattered 1's/4's and bottom empty, missing the central 4/1/2 pattern; expected 10x10 vertical crop/pad of rows ~10-18; difference: selected wrong block (rows 2-3 and 9-18 loosely), ignoring main object's vertical span.
 * Cropping and padding functions worked technically (produced square outputs), but fed bad inputs, so outputs mismatched in content (extra zeros, wrong elements) and size.
 * No connected component analysis, so missed subtle object cohesion (e.g., 8-connected non-zeros for shapes); density sum overlooked vertical/horizontal sparsity in main objects.
 * Bug in Kadane's: The condition `if counts[i] > max_current + counts[i]` simplifies to `0 > max_current`, which is rarely true, causing incorrect start/end indices (e.g., often picks single high-density rows or full grid).
 * extract_objects not present, but would be essential—current approach lacks object detection, treating rows independently.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a large ~19x19 grid with scattered 5's, 3's, and 4's in disconnected patches (e.g., isolated 5's in rows 1-5 and 7-8, then a partial 3/4/5 shape in rows 11-15, plus bottom 5's), heavily zero-padded, resembling noise rather than a cohesive object. This mismatches what a correct extraction should be: likely a tight square crop of the central-right 3/4/5 pattern (rows ~11-15, columns ~7-18 or similar, forming a shape like in training 2), padded to ~9x9 or 10x10, omitting top-left 3's/5's and bottom 5's as secondary. The output includes extraneous elements (e.g., top 3's in row 3, lone 4 in row 2) and excessive empty space, indicating the row block selection grabbed too much (probably rows 0-18 via poor density), failing to isolate the main clustered object around the 3/4/5 block.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves extracting a central or primary "object" or pattern from a larger grid of numbers (likely representing a visual image or diagram with filled cells), by cropping to the bounding area of the main content while excluding borders, noise, or extraneous elements, and then padding the result to a square shape for output. The goal is to preserve the structure of the core pattern, which appears to be a connected or dense region of non-zero values, but the cropping must be precise to match subtle asymmetries or exclusions in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The cropping should focus on the minimal bounding box around the densest or most connected non-zero regions, but not necessarily the absolute max-sum contiguous segment, as this can include unwanted extensions (e.g., thin borders or disconnected parts).
 * Padding to square must center the content evenly, using zeros, but only after accurate cropping; over-cropping or under-cropping leads to shifted or incomplete patterns.
 * Grids have varying sizes and may include symmetric borders (e.g., repeating patterns like 3's or 5's on edges) that should be partially or fully excluded to isolate the inner object.
 * Non-zero counts in rows/columns are key, but the "max sum positive segment" approach overemphasizes density and can merge separate regions; subtleties include handling gaps (zeros) within the object without breaking it, and excluding outer frames even if they have non-zeros.
 * Expected outputs often rotate, shift, or selectively include/exclude rows/columns compared to naive bounding boxes, suggesting rules for "main object" identification (e.g., largest connected component via flood-fill, or excluding perimeter noise).
 * Asymmetries in expected vs. generated: e.g., in training 1, expected excludes some left/top non-zeros and adjusts right/bottom; in training 2, expected shifts inner patterns and excludes certain edge non-zeros; in training 3, expected reorders or rotates outer frames while cropping inner differently.
 * All examples show the output padded to square (e.g., 13x13 for training 1, 10x10 for 2 and 3, 7x7 for test), implying the crop size determines the square side as max(height, width) of crop.
 * Subtle element: Objects may have internal zeros (holes or gaps) that should be preserved, but the bounding box must encompass the entire logical shape without extending to surrounding zeros or borders.
 * Consider connected components: The main object is likely the largest or most central blob of non-zeros, ignoring small isolated parts.
 * Padding is symmetric (floor/ceil division for even/odd differences), but cropping errors propagate to make outputs visually "off-center" or missing parts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [sum(1 for x in row if x != 0) for row in g]
```
(This computes per-row non-zero density, useful for initial vertical scanning to identify candidate row ranges.)

def col_nonzero_counts(selected_g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not selected_g:
        return []
    n_cols = len(selected_g[0])
    counts = [0] * n_cols
    for row in selected_g:
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                counts[j] += 1
    return counts
```
(This computes per-column non-zero density on a row-selected subgrid, useful for horizontal refinement.)

def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, start_c: int, end_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[start_c:end_c + 1] for row in g[start_r:end_r + 1]]
```
(Basic cropping utility; correct and reusable, but needs better start/end logic.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped or not any(any(x != 0 for x in row) for row in cropped):
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    s = max(h, w)
    # Assuming pad_columns and pad_rows are defined as in the attempt (they handle left/right and top/bottom zero padding symmetrically)
    cropped = pad_columns(cropped, s)  # Placeholder; implement as in attempt
    cropped = pad_rows(cropped, s)     # Placeholder; implement as in attempt
    return cropped
```
(Padding logic is solid for making square; handles empty cases and centering well, but only useful after correct cropping.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The max-sum positive segment finder works for identifying dense row/column ranges but fails by including extraneous border non-zeros (e.g., in training 1, it captures outer 3's on left/right, leading to wider crop than expected; generated row 0 has [0,0,3,0,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,...], shifting the pattern rightward).
 * In training 1, generated includes extra top/bottom rows and left columns with partial 3's/8's, making the output 13x13 but misaligned (e.g., row 2 generated has 8's starting too early; expected excludes some left 3's and adjusts inner 8/6 placements); unknown why it over-extends, possibly due to segment including zero-gapped borders.
 * Training 2 generated crops too narrowly or shifts inner 3/4 patterns incorrectly (e.g., row 1 has 3 in col 3, but expected has it later; row 3 generated [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...], missing left exclusions and including unwanted 3's); col segment finder likely grabs partial densities.
 * Training 2 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., row 7 generated matches but row 4 has extra 3's); suggests row selection is okay but col cropping cuts off right edges incorrectly.
 * In training 3, generated preserves outer 4's but crops inner 1/2 differently (e.g., row 2 generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,...] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,...], including left 4's that should be excluded and missing right shifts); appears to treat borders as part of the object.
 * Overall, the approach understands density-based cropping but misses excluding perimeter frames (common in all examples) and handling asymmetries (e.g., expected often trims one side more than the other).
 * find_max_sum_positive_segment_indices is partially helpful for contiguous dense areas but broken for puzzles with gapped or asymmetric objects (skips zeros too aggressively, missing holistic bounding).
 * No connected component analysis (e.g., flood-fill to find main blob) was attempted, which seems essential for isolating the core pattern from borders.
 * pad_to_square and related padders are correct and not the failure point; issues are upstream in selection/cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 7x7 grid that appears cropped to a central cross-like pattern with 3's on borders and inner 4's, but without the test input grid, it's hard to verify; however, based on training patterns, it likely over-includes edge 3's (e.g., row 0 [0,0,3,3,0,0,0] suggests partial border capture) and may misalign the inner 4 (only one 4 visible in row 3, possibly too narrow crop).
 * It does not look fully correct, as training attempts consistently failed by similar over-extension (e.g., including outer frames), so this probably includes unwanted perimeter elements while potentially excluding subtle inner extensions; the bottom row [0,0,0,0,3,0,0] looks like asymmetric padding or cropping error.
 * To handle test case, need better border detection (e.g., exclude rows/cols with uniform low-density patterns) and verify against expected by mentally simulating: assuming test input has outer 3-frames like training 1/2, correct output should trim them more aggressively for a tighter inner square.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns (likely representing images, letters, or shapes with numbers as pixel values/colors), where the goal is to extract, crop, and center the "main" non-zero pattern into a square grid while preserving the relative structure, but the current program fails to align or crop correctly, leading to shifts, distortions, or incorrect bounding in all cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main pattern is defined by a contiguous block of rows with non-zero elements, but cropping must use a global bounding box (min/max columns across the entire block) rather than per-row tight bounds, to avoid row-specific shifts that misalign the pattern horizontally.
 * Padding must be centered both horizontally (per row) and vertically (adding zero rows), but the square size s should be based on the maximum of the block height and the global width of the pattern, ensuring the entire structure fits without distortion or overflow.
 * Expected outputs maintain the original relative positions of non-zero elements within the pattern, with symmetric zero-padding to form a square; subtle asymmetries in the input (e.g., uneven non-zero distributions) must be preserved, not "corrected" by aggressive per-row cropping.
 * Grids may have sparse or irregular borders/noise (e.g., isolated zeros or small non-zero outliers outside the main block), which should be ignored by focusing only on the densest contiguous non-zero row sequence.
 * Output size varies by input (e.g., 13x13 for train1, 10x10 for others), suggesting s is dynamically computed as max(height_of_block, width_of_global_bounds), not fixed.
 * Numbers (e.g., 3,8,6 in train1; 5,3,4 in train2) represent distinct "colors" or shape elements and must not be altered—only positions adjusted via cropping/padding.
 * Potential noise: Inputs may have all-zero rows/columns that act as borders, but the main pattern might not span the full grid width/height, requiring tight global extraction without including empty space inside the bounds.
 * Vertical centering adds zero rows top/bottom, but horizontal centering per row must align to the global structure, not independently shift elements.
 * Subtle element: In train1 expected, the bottom-right has [0,3,3] while generated has [0,3,0], indicating failure to preserve exact intra-pattern spacing; similarly, train2 expected shifts some rows (e.g., row3 has [0,0,3,...] vs generated [3,3,0,...]), suggesting the program over-crops or misaligns left edges.
 * Train3 shows rotation-like shifts (e.g., expected starts rows with [0,4,...] alternating, generated with [4,0,...]), hinting at possible orientation or alignment rules, but likely just bounding box issues.
 * All examples have even/odd symmetries in padding, so integer division for left/right/top/bottom must floor consistently to avoid off-center results.
 * Considerations from attempts: Longest contiguous block works for vertical extraction (avoids top/bottom noise), but combining with per-row bounds causes horizontal misalignment; global col min/max across block would fix this.

    """Computes the min and max non-zero column indices for each row (tight bounds per row)."""
    if not g:
        return []
    n_cols = len(g[0])
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
This is partially helpful for per-row analysis but broken for the puzzle—using it leads to misalignment; modify to compute global min/max across the block instead.

```python
def pad_row_to_size(row: List[int], size: int) -> List[int]:
    """Pads a single row centered with zeros to the target size."""
    curr_w = len(row)
    if curr_w >= size:
        return row
    left = (size - curr_w) // 2
    right = size - curr_w - left
    return [0] * left + row + [0] * right

def pad_rows_centered(rows: List[List[int]], size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Pads the grid vertically centered with zero rows to the target size."""
    curr_h = len(rows)
    if curr_h >= size:
        return rows
    top = (size - curr_h) // 2
    bottom = size - curr_h - top
    zero_row = [0] * len(rows[0]) if rows else [0] * size
    padded = [zero_row[:] for _ in range(top)] + rows + [zero_row[:] for _ in range(bottom)]
    return padded
```
These are helpful for centering (both horizontal and vertical), as expected outputs show symmetric zero-padding; they work correctly when applied after proper global cropping.

The main `program` function is not helpful overall—it's broken due to per-row cropping causing shifts; do not reuse without replacing `get_row_bounds` and `compute_max_tight_width` with global versions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the vertical main block (longest contiguous non-zero rows) and applies centered padding, which isolates the core height in all trainings (e.g., skips top/bottom noise in train1 and train2).
 * However, per-row tight cropping misaligns horizontal positions, leading to left-shifts or distortions (e.g., in train1, generated row2 starts with [3,3,8,...] but expected [0,3,0,...], preserving a leading zero gap; unknown why the program fills/omits these gaps).
 * Train1 mismatches multiple rows: generated row0 [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0] (generated has incorrect internal 3 placements); row4 generated [0,3,0,8,0,0,6,0,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,0,6,0,0,8,0,3,3] (missing trailing 3); row12 generated [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 and wrong positions).
 * Train2 mismatches row3: generated [3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5,0] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5] (generated left-shifts and alters structure); row4 generated [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs expected [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0] (missing elements and shifts); row5 has extra 4 in expected middle.
 * Train3 mismatches orientations: generated rows alternate starting with 4 but expected alternates with 0/4 (e.g., row0 generated [4,0,4,...] vs expected [0,4,0,...]); row2 generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] (leading 4 vs 0, and internal shifts); this suggests the program doesn't handle global left-padding correctly.
 * All trainings fail due to horizontal misalignment from per-row bounds; vertical block detection works but isn't enough alone.
 * No object extraction function was used (none provided beyond bounds), but a global_bounds function would be essential to compute min_col = min(first for first,_ in bounds[start:end+1]), max_col = max(last for _,last in bounds[start:end+1]), then slice all rows[start:end+1] to [min_col:max_col+1] before padding.
 * compute_max_tight_width is unhelpful/broken— it maxes per-row widths but ignores global alignment; replace with global width computation.
 * Padding functions are correct but applied too early/after bad cropping, causing the square to embed a distorted pattern.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it extracts a 13x13 grid with the main pattern (rows with 3,4,5) vertically centered but horizontally left-aligned and over-padded with zeros, creating a sparse, non-symmetric result (e.g., row4 [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5] starts with two 5s but expected likely needs global crop to center the inner 3/4/5 shape without leading/trailing excesses).
 * It includes the full input width (13 cols) for non-cropped rows but pads others, leading to inconsistency (e.g., row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] is too narrow and right-shifted relative to row4); this mismatches the tight, centered expectations from trainings.
 * The output has excessive top/bottom zeros (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zero), suggesting vertical padding is applied but the block detection might include empty rows or fail to tighten height; the pattern looks like a centered "object" with borders but distorted (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] has isolated 4 not aligned with trainings' symmetries).
 * To handle test case, must use global horizontal bounds across the detected row block (likely rows 3-9), crop all to that width (e.g., cols 2-10 or similar for the 3/4/5 core), pad to s=max(7,9?)=9 or whatever fits, then vertically center in 9x9—but current 13x13 is wrong size, indicating s computation fails when max_w < input width.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation to extract, crop, and normalize the central or "main" graphical element (likely a symbol or image composed of numbered cells representing colors or shapes) from a larger input grid, then padding it to a square format while preserving the relative structure. The goal is to focus on the core content, ignoring borders, noise, or extraneous empty areas, as seen in the mismatches between generated and expected outputs across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main block must be identified as a contiguous sequence of "significant" rows (those with more than a minimal number of non-zeros, like >2, or non-empty), but this threshold may be too aggressive or simplistic, leading to inclusion/exclusion of rows that shift the content vertically or horizontally.
 * Cropping should use tight bounding boxes per row and overall, but must account for irregular shapes where not all rows span the full width; over-cropping or under-cropping columns can misalign elements (e.g., shifting 8's, 3's, or 6's left/right).
 * Padding to square must be centered with even/odd distribution of zeros on all sides, but the current logic may not handle asymmetric content well, resulting in off-center placement or incorrect size (e.g., 13x13 output when expected might be smaller or differently proportioned).
 * Subtle elements include handling "noise" rows/columns with sparse non-zeros (e.g., single 3's in borders that should be omitted), preserving exact positions of numbers like 8,6,4 which form shapes, and ensuring the output matches expected asymmetries (e.g., expected has varying indents in borders).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 13x13, 10x10), so the solution must be general; non-zero counts aren't uniform—some rows have patterns like frames (3's,5's) that might be part of the main content or borders.
 * Easy-to-miss: The "main block" isn't always the longest non-empty sequence; it may need to exclude top/bottom frames or isolated elements, and column bounds should be the union of row mins/maxes without including padding zeros prematurely.
 * All examples show borders (e.g., 3's,5's,4's as frames), suggesting the puzzle is about isolating inner symbols (e.g., combinations of 8,6,4,1,2) while keeping some frame elements if integral to the visual.

These functions are helpful for basic analysis (emptiness, counts, bounds) and can be building blocks for better main block detection.

    """Find the start and end indices of the longest sequence of significant non-empty rows."""
    # This is broken: uses a fixed >2 threshold and longest streak, which includes/excludes wrong rows (e.g., sparse border rows in ex1/2, flips row order in ex3).

    """Pad the cropped grid to a square by adding zero rows and columns centered."""
    # Generally correct for centering, but can produce oversized/off-center results if crop is wrong (e.g., 13x13 with uneven pads).
```
The main `program` orchestrates these but inherits flaws from `find_main_block`, making it unhelpful overall without fixes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies basic grid structure and attempts to find a "main block" via non-zero counts and bounds, which works for rough cropping in dense areas but fails to exclude borders/frames, leading to incorrect vertical/horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Padding logic centers content reasonably (e.g., adds zeros top/bottom/left/right), and row/column bound computation captures non-zeros accurately per row; this handles symmetric padding well when crop is right.
 * What didn't work: Main block detection is too simplistic (longest streak with >2 non-zeros), including sparse rows (e.g., Train1 row12 with single 3's) or excluding key rows, causing vertical misalignment (e.g., Train1 generated starts main content at row1 instead of row2, shifts 3's/8's).
 * Train1: Generated includes extra top row with 3's, misplaces 8's and 6's (e.g., row2: [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why exact positions differ, but likely over-cropping columns); bottom row has [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (extra 3 misplaced).
 * Train2: Generated flips/omits some rows (e.g., row3 [5,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,5] matches, but row4 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—shifts 3's right, adds extra 3's); includes top/bottom frames wrong (row1 [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] matches, but row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—misaligned 3).
 * Train3: Generated reverses row order (e.g., starts with [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] as row1, but expected starts with [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] as row1), scrambles inner 1's/2's (e.g., row5 [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,0] vs expected [0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,4]—flips frame and shifts content); unknown cause, possibly bound computation inverting rows.
 * Overall: No training examples pass; attempt shows partial grasp of cropping/padding but misses subtle frame detection and exact bound tightening.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 grid with heavy top/bottom padding (rows 0-2 and 10-12 all zeros), but the main content (rows 3-9) appears shifted left with uneven borders (e.g., row4 starts [5,5,0,3,...] suggesting included left frame 5's that might be borders to omit, and right 5's misaligned).
 * It includes sparse rows like row3 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] which may be noise, and the inner 3's/4's look compressed (e.g., row6 [5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5] vs potential expected tighter crop without double 5's), making the "symbol" (perhaps a 4 inside 3's) off-center and oversized.
 * Does not make sense as correct because trainings failed similarly (extra frames, shifts), so likely same flaw in main block detection including outer 5's as part of content; expected probably crops tighter to inner 3/4 pattern, padding to smaller square (e.g., 7x7 or 9x9) centered without left/right 5's dominating.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers (likely representing a visual pattern or image with different "colors" or values like 3,6,8) to extract the central or main non-zero content, crop it to a tight bounding box, and pad it symmetrically to form a square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main block" should be identified as the longest consecutive sequence of rows with any non-zero elements, but care must be taken to exclude leading/trailing fully zero rows without including isolated zero rows within the block if they are structurally important (e.g., in example 1, internal zero positions are preserved but the block start/end must align precisely with the expected cropped area).
 * Column bounds must be computed only over the main row block, finding the minimal and maximal non-zero columns across those rows, but without expanding beyond the actual content—subtly, if a row in the block has no non-zeros (but is included in the block due to adjacency), its bounds should not affect min/max (current compute_col_bounds skips if l==-1, which is good, but may still misalign if block includes empty rows incorrectly).
 * Padding to square must be symmetric (centering the content) using zeros, first padding columns to match height, then rows to match the new width, but the target size is max(h,w) after cropping—issue is that if cropping misses parts, padding adds extra zeros in wrong places (e.g., in example 1, generated adds unintended non-zeros or shifts content left/right).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes with borders of zeros; the output should be square but retain the exact relative positions of non-zeros from the cropped area (e.g., example 2 shows misalignment in rows 3-4 where generated has [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] but expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], indicating column crop is too narrow or shifted).
 * Subtle element: Non-zeros represent "pixels" of different types (e.g., 3 might be borders, 6/8 fills), and the puzzle likely requires exact reproduction without altering values or introducing new ones—easy to miss that bounding box must be inclusive of all edge non-zeros but exclusive of outer empty space.
 * In example 3, the pattern alternates rows/columns, and generated starts with [4,0,4,...] but expected flips the starting row order, suggesting possible row reversal or reordering not handled (or wrong block detection includes extra).
 * General: Handle empty or all-zero grids by returning [[0]]; assume rectangular input; outputs are lists of lists, printed as rows.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one shown), consider that main block detection uses row non-zero counts correctly but may over-include if zero rows are adjacent (e.g., example 1 generated includes row 0 with partial non-zeros? Wait, generated row 0 [0,0,3,0,3,...] suggests crop started too early or wrong min_c).

        bounds.append((first, last))

```
(Useful for per-row min/max non-zero columns; essential for tight cropping, but only applied to main block rows.)

(Combines row bounds for overall column crop; helpful but may yield empty if all rows in block are zero, leading to [[0]] fallback.)

```
(Handles symmetric zero-padding for dimensions; useful and correct in isolation, but applied after faulty crop leads to misaligned content.)

```python
def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    size = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, False)  # pad columns
    cropped = pad_dimension(cropped, size, True)   # pad rows
    return cropped
```
(Overall squaring logic; helpful but order matters—padding columns first then rows ensures square, but if w > h initially, row padding adds to height correctly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the concept of finding a main non-zero block via row counts and cropping to bounding box, which works for isolating content in dense grids but fails on precise start/end (e.g., Train 1 generated starts crop too early, including extraneous left-shifted 3's in row 0 and mismatches like row 2 [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—shifted right by 1 and wrong values at ends; unknown why exact mismatch but likely min_c off by 1).
 * Train 2: Cropping works for row block but column bounds too narrow, omitting right-side elements (generated row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—missing two 3's on right, extra 3 on left); padding adds zeros incorrectly around incomplete crop.
 * Train 3: Block detection includes wrong rows, leading to row order flip or extra borders (generated row 0 [4,0,4,...] vs expected row 0 [0,4,0,...]—seems like it cropped starting from an offset row and didn't reverse or adjust for alternating pattern).
 * find_main_block is helpful but broken for cases with internal zero rows that should be included (it skips on any zero count row, potentially splitting blocks—e.g., if a structural zero row has count=0 but is part of the object, it's excluded).
 * get_row_bounds and compute_col_bounds are essential and mostly correct but fail when block has varying widths, leading to over-tight crops.
 * pad_dimension and pad_to_square are not broken and helpful for final output, but unhelpful if upstream crop is wrong (don't modify, but ensure crop inputs are accurate).
 * Overall, no extraction of "objects" like connected components was attempted, which might be needed if multiple disjoint parts exist (not in this code, but could be relevant for subtleties like ignoring outliers); current approach assumes single main block.
 * Train 1 also mismatches bottom rows (e.g., generated row 12 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—extra 3 and wrong positions, likely from faulty end_r or max_c).
 * No function for connected component analysis or object extraction, which might be unhelpful here since the puzzle seems bounding-box based, not segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped a central 5x13-ish pattern (rows ~3-9 with 3's,5's,4's) but padded excessively to 13x13 with large zero borders, shifting the content downward and not centering it properly (e.g., non-zeros start at row 3, but expected likely tighter crop to rows 4-8, columns ~3-10, padded to ~7x7 square embedded in zeros without the wide empty top/bottom). 
 * It includes symmetric 5's on left/right but mismatches internal structure (e.g., row 5 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5] suggests incomplete column crop, missing connections like the 4 in row 6); this doesn't make sense as a clean extraction—likely wrong min_c/max_c (too wide on sides, too narrow vertically) and over-pads without preserving the "object" shape (e.g., the cross-like 3's and inner 4 seem distorted). 
 * To handle test case, account for multiple horizontal bars (top/bottom 5's, middle 3's) by ensuring block includes all connected non-zeros vertically, even if sparse; current code probably picks a partial block, leading to missing top/bottom elements.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid processing, where the goal is to identify the primary "object" or contiguous region of non-zero values in a 2D grid (likely representing an image or shape), crop it to its tight bounding box, and then pad the result to form a square grid while preserving the content. The output should be a transformed grid that isolates and normalizes the main feature for comparison or rendering.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of rows of integers (0 for empty/background, non-zero for filled/object pixels), and the "object" is defined by contiguous sequences of rows with non-zero counts, ignoring isolated or sparse rows.
 * Focus on the largest contiguous block of rows with any non-zeros to avoid including noise or separate components; subtle elements include handling rows with varying non-zero positions (e.g., irregular shapes) and ensuring column bounds are computed only over the selected rows.
 * Cropping must create a tight bounding box: min/max columns based on the first/last non-zero in each relevant row, but aggregated globally to avoid over-cropping jagged edges.
 * Padding to square should center the content (symmetric or near-symmetric padding with zeros) and handle cases where height and width differ, potentially starting from a 1x1 zero grid if empty.
 * Edge cases: empty grids, all-zero rows/columns, single-row/column objects, or grids where non-zeros don't align perfectly; avoid assuming uniform row lengths or non-negative values.
 * Non-zero values might represent different "colors" or intensities, but treatment is binary (non-zero vs. zero) for bounding/cropping; preserve original values in the output.
 * Subtlety: Contiguous blocks reset on zero-count rows, so multiple objects might exist, but only the largest is selected—easy to miss if code doesn't properly scan for max length.
 * Global bounds must initialize correctly (e.g., min_col to infinity or grid width, max_col to -1) to handle rows with no non-zeros within the block.

    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is solid for row density; use it to identify active rows.)

```python
def get_row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [count_nonzeros(row) for row in g]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing; efficiently computes non-zero counts per row.)

```python
def find_largest_contiguous_block(counts: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    n = len(counts)
    max_length = 0
    best_start = 0
    current_start = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == n or counts[i] == 0:
            length = i - current_start
            if length > max_length:
                max_length = length
                best_start = current_start
            current_start = i + 1
    best_end = best_start + max_length - 1
    return best_start, best_end
```
(This correctly identifies the start/end of the largest run of non-zero-count rows; essential for isolating the main object vertically. Handles edge cases like all-zero grid returning (0,-1) or similar.)

```python
def get_row_first_last(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    for row in g:
        n = len(row)
        first = n  # Initialize to full width (beyond any valid index)
        last = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds
```
(Useful for per-row horizontal bounds; note initialization of first to n and last to -1 to handle all-zero rows gracefully, where (n, -1) indicates empty.)

```python
def crop_grid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped
```
(Reliable for extracting subgrid; assumes valid indices and handles empty slices.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    size = max(h, w)
    # Pad columns first if needed
    if w < size:
        pad_left = (size - w) // 2
        pad_right = size - w - pad_left
        for i in range(h):
            grid[i] = [0] * pad_left + grid[i] + [0] * pad_right
        w = size
    # Pad rows if needed
    if h < size:
        pad_top = (size - h) // 2
        pad_bottom = size - h - pad_top
        empty = [0] * size
        for _ in range(pad_top):
            grid.insert(0, empty[:])
        for _ in range(pad_bottom):
            grid.append(empty[:])
    return grid
```
(Effective for centering and squaring; handles empty grids and asymmetric padding well, preserving original values.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt demonstrates partial understanding of the puzzle by correctly identifying the need for contiguous row selection, per-row bounds, tight cropping, and square padding, but fails entirely due to a runtime error in all cases.
 * What worked: The vertical block detection (find_largest_contiguous_block) and per-row bounds (get_row_first_last) are logically sound and would isolate the main object if integrated properly; cropping and padding functions execute without issues in isolation.
 * What didn't work: The compute_global_bounds function is broken—it incorrectly initializes min_c as len(bounds[0][0]), where bounds[0][0] is an int (column index), causing "object of type 'int' has no len()" error on all inputs; this prevents any successful execution, so no outputs are generated for analysis.
 * No training examples or test passed; all resulted in the same execution error, indicating the bug blocks the entire pipeline.
 * The approach assumes the largest contiguous non-zero row block is the "object," which aligns with puzzle subtleties (e.g., ignoring noise), but untested due to crash.
 * Function compute_global_bounds is broken and unhelpful in its current form (causes crash; don't use without fixing initialization to something like min_c = float('inf') or grid width, and max_c = -1, then update only if l != -1).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to the len() on int bug, so no actual grid is generated—completely incorrect and unusable for verification.
 * Expected test output should be a square-padded bounding box of the main contiguous object (e.g., if test input has a central shape spanning rows 2-5 and columns 3-7, output would crop to that 4x5 region, pad to 5x5 with zeros around, preserving non-zeros); the error prevents any match, and without seeing the input grid, it's unclear if the approach would otherwise align, but the crash confirms it does not produce a valid result.
 * This highlights the need to handle empty or edge rows in bounds aggregation without assuming non-empty tuples.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns (likely representing shapes, figures, or "objects" with pixel values like 3,5,6,8,4 indicating colors or types), where the goal is to extract the "main" or primary figure/object from the input grid, normalize its position (e.g., translate to top-left), compute a bounding box, and output a square grid representation padded with zeros, while ignoring or excluding noise, frames, or secondary elements. The output size is based on the max dimension of the extracted region, but the results suggest the extraction criteria (e.g., row selection, bounding box) are imprecise, leading to inclusions/exclusions of pixels that don't match expectations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain a "main" figure (dense cluster of non-zero pixels) surrounded by potential noise, frames, or disconnected elements (e.g., sparse lines or dots outside the core shape); the program must identify and isolate only the primary connected or consecutive component, excluding outer frames or isolated pixels.
 * Y-range selection is critical: use consecutive rows with non-zero sums, but prioritize the block with maximum total non-zero pixels to avoid noise; however, subtle disconnected parts (e.g., small protrusions or separate blobs) may need inclusion if part of the main structure, or exclusion if they are artifacts.
 * Bounding box computation must tightly fit the main figure's extent (min/max x/y of non-zeros in selected rows), but avoid expanding to include frame-like borders; translation shifts to (0,0) origin, and output is a square of side max(width, height) of the bbox, padded with zeros—do not return the original n x n size unless s == n.
 * Subtleties include handling asymmetric shapes (e.g., figures not centered), multiple potential "main" blocks (select largest by sum or area), and ensuring no pixel values are altered during extraction/translation—only positions change.
 * Noise handling: Grids may have zero-rows or sparse rows above/below/around the main figure; do not include them in the y-range or bbox unless they connect to the main structure.
 * Output must preserve exact pixel values and relative positions within the extracted region; mismatches often occur in top/bottom rows (e.g., extra 3s included as noise) or side alignments (e.g., shifted 8s or 6s).
 * Consider connected components: The main figure may not be fully rectangular; use row_bounds to find per-row min/max x, but aggregate carefully to avoid over-expansion.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return zero-filled n x n; if no main block, output zeros; varying grid sizes (10x10 or 13x13) mean s can be < n, leading to smaller outputs implicitly padded in display.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect y-range (including noise rows) or bbox (missing/extruding parts), resulting in shifted or incomplete figures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several modular functions for row analysis and extraction, which are partially useful for identifying and isolating regions but need refinement for accurate main figure selection (e.g., better y-range logic or component detection). No new types are defined, but Tuple[int, int] for bounds and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for pixels (y,x,value) are effective for handling positions and values.

The main `program` function composes these but is flawed in y-range/bbox selection; no explicit object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) is present, which might be needed for complex shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (all training examples failed); it correctly implements modular extraction/translation/padding but fails on core selection logic.
 * What worked: Pixel extraction preserves values; translation to (0,0) normalizes position; square padding handles varying bbox sizes; row_sums and row_bounds efficiently identify dense regions without full scans.
 * What didn't work: Y-range selection via max-sum consecutive rows includes noise (e.g., top/bottom sparse rows with 3s in train1), leading to bbox that captures extras; no handling for disconnected components or frames, causing over-inclusion; output size s often matches n but with misplaced pixels due to wrong min_y/max_y.
 * Train1: Generated includes extra 3s in row0 (positions 2,4) and row12 (3s at 3,4), but expected has 3s at 3 and 10 in row0, and 3s at 5 and 7 in row12; inner figure (8s,6s) is shifted/missing parts (e.g., generated row2 has 8s at 2-3 but expected at 3; row10 has 8s at 8-9 but expected at 9 missing); overall, figure is vertically expanded with noise, horizontally misaligned (unknown reason, possibly bbox min_x too low).
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 at 3 but expected all 0s except row1 3 at 6; row3 has 3s at 1-2 but expected 3 at 2; row4 has 5 at 0,3 at 2 but expected 5 at 0,3s at 1-2; row5 matches somewhat but row6 has 4s missing in expected positions; figure is incomplete/shifted rightward, with extra 3s in noise rows (e.g., row1), suggesting wrong y-range including top noise.
 * Train3: Generated row0/1 are [4,0,4,...]/[0,4,0,...] but expected swapped to [0,4,0,...]/[4,0,4,...], indicating possible rotation or frame misextraction; inner 1s/2s are misplaced (e.g., generated row2 has 1 at 5 but expected row2 all 0s except 1s at 3-4; row4 has 2s at 4-5 but expected row4 2s at 4-5 ok, but surrounding 1s wrong); frame is included but inverted, inner figure vertically shifted down by ~1 row (unknown reason, likely y-range starts too early).
 * Function `get_main_bbox` is helpful but broken when y-range is noisy (propagates errors); `find_main_y_range` is essential but insufficient (needs connectivity or size threshold); no unhelpful functions, but the composition in `program` assumes single main block—add component detection for multi-blob grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of normalization but misses subtle noise exclusion and precise component isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it extracts a partial figure (5s on sides, 3s/4s in middle) but places it starting from row1 (with row0 as [0s,3,3,0s] like noise or bottom fragment), repeats the pattern in rows1-2/4-5 but inverts or shifts (e.g., row2 has 3s at 4-8 but test input row? has different), adds isolated 3 in row6 middle, then pads with 7+ zero rows— this suggests wrong y-range (included top noise, excluded bottom?), incomplete bbox (missing left/right alignments, e.g., 5s at 0-1 and 11-12 but 3s not centered), and over-padding without centering. Expected likely a tight square of the central cross-like figure (3s horizontal, 4s vertical-ish, framed by 5s) translated to top-left without extras, possibly 7x7 or similar s<13, but output bloats to 13x13 with misplaced elements (e.g., duplicated rows 1/5 and 2/4 indicate loop error or wrong min_y). It fails to isolate the main "plus" shape, including apparent noise 3s, and doesn't match a clean normalized output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting the "main" visual object or pattern from a sparse grid by identifying the bounding box of non-zero cells across relevant rows (not necessarily strictly consecutive), cropping to that subgrid, and then centering it within a square grid via symmetric padding with zeros, preserving the relative structure and values of the original content. The goal is to isolate and normalize the core artwork or symbol while ignoring outer noise or framing, but ensuring no distortion of internal zeros or shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The "main object" may span rows that are not fully consecutive non-zero counts; isolated zero rows within the object's vertical extent must be included if they are part of the bounding structure (e.g., gaps in patterns like letters or symbols), so the row selection should use the overall min-max row bounds of non-zeros rather than the longest consecutive block.
 * Column cropping must use the tightest bounding box across the selected rows, but padding must be centered (symmetric left/right, top/bottom) to maintain visual alignment, and the target square size should be based on the max of the cropped height/width without over-trimming internal structure.
 * Subtle elements include preserving exact non-zero values (e.g., 3,8,6) and their positions, including internal zeros that define shapes (e.g., holes in blobs); over-cropping can merge or shift these, leading to mismatches.
 * Grids may have outer zero framing or noise (e.g., stray non-zeros), which should be excluded; the output is always square, but size varies based on content (e.g., 13x13 for Train1, 10x10 for Train2/3).
 * Handle empty or all-zero inputs by returning a minimal [[0]] or similar, but real cases have clear central patterns.
 * Padding must not introduce asymmetry; use integer division for even/odd splits to center properly.
 * Non-zero count per row helps identify active rows, but the block-finding logic fails when the object has vertical gaps (common in puzzles like ASCII art or pixel drawings).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements row non-zero counting, per-row bounds, subgrid cropping, and centered padding to square, which works for dense objects without gaps (e.g., partial credit for column alignment in some cases).
 * Failed to select the full vertical extent of the object by using longest consecutive non-zero row block, excluding necessary gapped zero rows (e.g., in Train1, cropped rows 1-11 excluding top/bottom framing, leading to shifted content and mismatched shapes like extra 3's in row 0 col 2 vs. expected zero).
 * In Train1, generated output includes incorrect values/positions (e.g., row 2 has [3,3,8,8,0,8,...] but expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,...]; row 5 has [0,3,8,8,6,6,...] but expected [3,3,8,8,6,6,...]—unknown reason for vertical shift/misalignment, possibly from wrong start_r).
 * Train2 generated mismatches in internal structure (e.g., row 3 [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], adding extra 3's and shifting 4's; row 4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs. expected [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0], wrong blob connectivity).
 * Train3 generated flips or misaligns patterns (e.g., row 0 [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]; entire top/bottom borders swapped, and internal 1/2 placements off like row 2 [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs. expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4]).
 * find_longest_block function is broken for gapped objects (assumes consecutive density, misses full height); not helpful for this puzzle—replace with overall min/max row of any non-zero.
 * No object extraction beyond density; lacks function to find global min/max row/col of all non-zeros, which would fix row selection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped too narrowly vertically (content only in rows 3-8 of 13, with symmetric zero padding top/bottom, but likely excludes parts of a taller object with gaps, similar to Train failures).
 * It centers a sub-pattern (e.g., 3's and 5's forming a shape with 4's inside), but the full 13x13 suggests the object spans more rows (e.g., top/bottom 5's and 3's may connect via sparse rows), leading to potential misalignment if gapped rows like row 3/9 are omitted.
 * Horizontal cropping seems okay (tight around cols 3-10), but vertical misses full extent (e.g., if test has framing like Train1, output should include more zero-gapped rows for correct shape like a letter or symbol).
 * Padding to 13x13 is oversized if object is smaller, but makes sense if global bounds are used; however, the isolated central block ignores potential outer connections, making the output incomplete (e.g., top/bottom rows all zero except possibly stray, but expected likely has adjusted framing).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers (likely representing a visual image or diagram with different "colors" or elements via numbers like 3,8,6) to extract and isolate the main central "object" or figure by cropping to its tight bounding box and then padding with zeros to form a centered square grid of appropriate size. The goal is to remove extraneous border or empty space while preserving the structure of the core content, ensuring the output matches the expected cropped and padded form exactly.

 * The main object may not occupy every row or column fully, so cropping must use the minimal bounding box that encloses all non-zero elements of the object without including irrelevant outer zeros or disconnected elements.
 * Padding must be centered (symmetric where possible, with even/odd distribution) both horizontally and vertically to make the grid square, using the maximum of the cropped height and width as the target size.
 * Non-zero counts per row are useful for identifying dense regions, but the "max sum nonzero block" must consider the actual connected or primary object, not just any consecutive dense rows—subtleties include handling objects that span irregular rows (e.g., with sparse rows in between) or have protrusions that affect column bounds.
 * Column bounds should be computed only over the selected rows to avoid including distant non-zeros outside the main object.
 * The grid may have symmetric borders or frames (e.g., repeating patterns like 3's or 5's around the edges), which should be excluded if they are not part of the core figure.
 * Subtle elements: Objects can have internal zeros (holes or gaps) that should be preserved, but the bounding box ignores them for cropping; ensure no shearing, shifting, or alteration of values during crop/pad.
 * All non-zero elements in the output must match positions and values exactly from the input's main object; extraneous non-zeros (e.g., from borders) lead to mismatches.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids default to [[0]]; objects may not be rectangular, so tight bounds are key; padding adds zeros only outside the crop.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def row_nonzero_count(row: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for x in row:
        if x != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def row_counts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [row_nonzero_count(row) for row in g]
```
These are helpful for identifying dense rows to locate potential object regions.

```python
def get_row_bounds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    bounds = []
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    for row in g:
        first = n_cols
        last = -1
        for j in range(n_cols):
            if row[j] != 0:
                first = min(first, j)
                last = max(last, j)
        bounds.append((first, last))
    return bounds

def compute_col_bounds(bounds: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, n_cols: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_c = n_cols
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        f, l = bounds[i]
        if l >= 0:
            min_c = min(min_c, f)
            max_c = max(max_c, l)
    return min_c, max_c
```
These are partially helpful for computing per-row and aggregate column bounds to define the crop area accurately.

```python
def crop_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, end_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    cropped = []
    for i in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        row = g[i][min_c : max_c + 1]
        cropped.append(row)
    return cropped

def pad_columns(cropped: List[List[int]], target_width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_width = len(cropped[0])
    if current_width >= target_width:
        return cropped
    col_pad_left = (target_width - current_width) // 2
    col_pad_right = target_width - current_width - col_pad_left
    for r in range(len(cropped)):
        cropped[r] = [0] * col_pad_left + cropped[r] + [0] * col_pad_right
    return cropped

def pad_rows(cropped: List[List[int]], target_size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped:
        return []
    current_height = len(cropped)
    if current_height >= target_size:
        return cropped
    row_pad_top = (target_size - current_height) // 2
    row_pad_bottom = target_size - current_height - row_pad_top
    size = len(cropped[0])
    for _ in range(row_pad_top):
        cropped.insert(0, [0] * size)
    for _ in range(row_pad_bottom):
        cropped.append([0] * size)
    return cropped

def pad_to_square(cropped: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not cropped or not cropped[0]:
        return [[0]]
    h = len(cropped)
    w = len(cropped[0])
    s = max(h, w)
    cropped = pad_columns(cropped, s)
    cropped = pad_rows(cropped, s)
    return cropped
```
These cropping and padding functions are helpful and correctly implement tight bounding box extraction and centered square padding, but they depend on accurate row/column selection upstream.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements bounding box cropping and centered padding to square, which preserves internal structure and adds zeros appropriately, but fails because row selection via max consecutive nonzero sum includes extraneous rows (e.g., top/bottom borders with partial non-zeros).
 * In training example 1, generated includes extra top/bottom rows with misplaced 3's (e.g., generated row 0: [0,0,3,0,3,0,...] vs expected row 0: [0,0,0,3,0,0,...]) and shifts internal elements (e.g., row 2 generated [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]), likely due to wrong row start/end and column bounds including border artifacts; bottom row also mismatches (generated [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]).
 * In training example 2, generated crops too tightly or shifts columns, omitting some 3's and 4's (e.g., generated row 3: [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected row 3: [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5], missing right-side 3's and altering 5 positions); also includes top row non-zeros incorrectly while expected has more zeros there.
 * In training example 3, generated starts with wrong row order (e.g., generated row 0: [4,0,4,0,...] vs expected row 0: [0,4,0,4,...]), indicating failure to identify the correct starting row for the object, and internal mismatches like row 2 generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] show shifted or incomplete bounds.
 * The find_max_sum_nonzero_block function is broken/not helpful as it assumes consecutive dense rows define the object, but puzzles have non-consecutive or bordered elements, leading to over-inclusion; don't use it in future without refinement to detect the primary connected component.
 * Overall, the approach demonstrates partial understanding of cropping/padding but misses identifying the exact main object bounds, treating borders as part of the figure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it produces a 13x13 square with the main content (3's,5's,4's forming what seems like a figure or letter) centered in rows 4-8 and columns 4-8, but padded heavily with outer zeros, which may be too loose—likely the expected is a tighter crop to just the non-zero block (e.g., 5x5 or similar square without the large empty borders), as the current method includes empty rows/columns from the input's sparse layout, mismatching the training expectations where tighter, object-focused squares are produced without extraneous space.
 * It incorrectly assumes the entire input height needs full padding to 13x13, but the object appears confined to a smaller central area (rows ~3-8, cols ~3-9), so the output bloats the grid unnecessarily and may shift positions if bounds are off, similar to training failures.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:55:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the objective is to identify the densest or most significant contiguous block of non-zero elements (likely representing an "object" or pattern), crop it to its tight bounding box, and then pad it symmetrically to form a square grid whose side length is the maximum of the cropped height and width, while preserving the original values and structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid represents a 2D pattern with numbers (e.g., 3,6,8) as filled cells of different types or colors, and 0s as empty space; the goal is to isolate the main "object" by finding the row with the highest non-zero count and extending to the contiguous non-empty rows around it, but this must account for irregular shapes where non-zeros don't span full widths.
 * Subtle elements include handling asymmetric padding (e.g., uneven left/right or top/bottom zeros to center the object), ensuring the bounding box is the minimal rectangle enclosing all non-zeros in the selected rows without including outer empty space, and avoiding over-cropping that cuts into the object (e.g., missing protrusions in sparse rows).
 * Key considerations: Multiple disconnected components might exist, but the program should focus on the "max count" block; empty grids or all-zero rows should return a single [[0]]; padding must be to the exact max(h,w) size without exceeding it; row and column bounds must be computed per selected rows only, not the full grid; subtle mismatches occur when the max-count row isn't perfectly centered or when contiguous extension includes sparse but relevant rows.
 * Easy-to-miss: The object may have "arms" or extensions in columns that aren't uniform across rows, so min/max col bounds must aggregate across the block; padding should insert zeros without shifting existing values; the output must match expected exactly, including positions of specific numbers like 3s forming borders or 8s in patterns.
 * Across attempts: No extraction of individual "objects" like blobs or connected components was done (just row-density based), which fails for non-uniform density; contiguous row extension works for dense blocks but misses cases where the object spans non-contiguous rows or has zero-rows inside; column cropping is too loose or tight, leading to shifted patterns.

These functions are helpful for computing row densities, finding contiguous blocks, calculating per-row bounds, cropping, and symmetric padding; they form a solid base for bounding-box extraction but need refinement for object selection.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken, but the overall `program` integration is flawed as it selects rows based solely on non-zero counts without verifying if the block encloses the full object (e.g., it may include irrelevant sparse rows or miss vertical extensions); `find_start_row` and `find_end_row` assume strict contiguity but fail if zero-count rows are internal to the object (though examples suggest no internal empties).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies a dense row block and applies bounding-box cropping and square padding in concept, but fails all training examples by producing grids with shifted or incomplete patterns (e.g., in Train 1, generated has extra 3s in row 0 and misplaced 8s/6s compared to expected, resulting in a non-matching shape; unknown why, possibly over-inclusive row selection or incorrect col bounds).
 * Train 1 generated includes unwanted top/bottom rows with partial 3s and alters internal structure (e.g., row 2 has 8s in wrong positions vs. expected's 0s and 3s), suggesting col bounds are too wide or row start/end is off by 1-2 rows.
 * Train 2 generated shifts 3s and 4s incorrectly (e.g., row 1 has 3s where expected has 0s, and row 3 has misplaced 3s/4s), likely from wrong vertical cropping that includes/excludes key rows; also pads to wrong size or asymmetrically.
 * Train 3 generated rotates or mirrors parts incorrectly (e.g., top rows swapped 4s and 0s vs. expected, and internal 1s/2s shifted), indicating row selection starts too early or col bounds ignore sparse edges.
 * No object extraction like connected components was attempted, which might be essential for handling non-row-dense objects; padding works symmetrically but often on wrong crop, leading to oversized or offset outputs.
 * All attempts miss that the "object" may require full-grid bounds if density is uniform, or handling of border-like numbers (e.g., 3s as frames in Train 1/2).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have cropped and padded a central pattern (with 3s,5s,4s forming a symmetric shape across rows 4-9, zero-padded to 13x13), but the heavy zero-padding (e.g., full zero rows 0-3 and 10-12) suggests overestimation of size or incorrect row selection, as the active pattern seems smaller (about 6x13 cropped, padded unnecessarily wide/high); without expected, it mismatches training patterns by including apparent "noise" like isolated 3s in row 4 and uneven 5s on sides, likely failing to tightly bound the main cross-like object in the center—explain why not correct: it doesn't center or square the core motif (e.g., the 3/4/5 block around columns 3-9), instead spreading zeros excessively, similar to training failures where bounds are loose.
