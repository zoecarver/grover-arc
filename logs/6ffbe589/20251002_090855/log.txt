=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 09:08:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 09:20:30] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 09:21:22] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to automatically detect, crop, and pad the central "object" or pattern (a connected or dense region of non-zero values representing shapes like numbers or symbols) to produce a tight, square bounding box output, removing empty borders while preserving the relative structure and values of the pattern. The input grids are larger (e.g., 20x20) with sparse non-zero elements forming the puzzle elements, and the output should be a smaller square grid (size determined by the bounding box) with zero-padding if needed to square it.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main pattern is a contiguous or near-contiguous blob of non-zero cells (e.g., digits like 3,8,6 representing filled pixels), often vertically or horizontally elongated, surrounded by large empty (zero) borders; cropping must tightly bound this blob without including irrelevant empty space or extraneous small features.
 * Row_nonzero counts (number of positive cells per row) are key for identifying dense rows, but the max subarray must handle cases where the blob isn't perfectly contiguous—subtle gaps (e.g., single zero rows/columns within the blob) should not split it if they are minimal.
 * Column bounding (min_c, max_c) must be recomputed after row trimming to avoid including outlier columns from trimmed rows; width/height calculation affects square sizing, where size = max(height, width), and padding is symmetric (//2 flooring).
 * Trimming logic for excess height (when height > width) should prioritize removing rows with fewer non-zeros, but avoid over-trimming if it cuts into the core pattern; additional checks for rows with <2 non-zeros help remove thin borders but can erroneously trim meaningful sparse rows in the pattern.
 * Patterns may have internal zeros (e.g., holes in '8's), so non-zero density alone isn't perfect—consider connectivity (e.g., flood fill for blobs) to distinguish main object from noise like isolated cells.
 * Square padding must center the cropped region, with pad_top/bottom/left/right calculated correctly; outputs must match exact expected sizes and positions, including preserving all non-zero values without alteration.
 * Subtle elements: Some patterns have asymmetric shapes (e.g., train1 has a central '8' with '3' borders and '6' insert); small disconnected components (e.g., train2's border '5's) should be excluded if not part of the main blob; rotations or symmetries in borders (e.g., train3's checkerboard '4's) may mislead density-based cropping.
 * Fallbacks for empty or invalid ranges (e.g., start > end) produce all-zero grids, but this shouldn't trigger on valid inputs; n=20 is hardcoded, assuming fixed input size.
 * All examples show the main pattern is roughly centered but offset, requiring dynamic detection rather than fixed coordinates.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def max_subarray_indices(arr: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Kadane's algorithm variant to find start/end indices of max sum subarray in row_nonzero.
    Useful for identifying contiguous dense row ranges, but may need adaptation for gapped blobs.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return 0, -1
    max_current = max_global = arr[0]
    current_start = 0
    global_start = 0
    global_end = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > max_current + arr[i]:
            max_current = arr[i]
            current_start = i
        else:
            max_current += arr[i]
        if max_current > max_global:
            max_global = max_current
            global_start = current_start
            global_end = i
    return global_start, global_end
```

```python
def compute_row_nonzero(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Computes count of >0 cells per row; essential for density-based row selection.
    """
    n = len(g)
    return [sum(x > 0 for x in row) for row in g]
```

(Note: No custom types like PuzzleElement are present; the above are core helpers from the attempt. No object extraction function is provided, but one could be added via flood-fill for connected components to better identify the main blob over density alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses density-based row selection (max subarray on row_nonzero) which works partially for finding core row ranges but fails to handle gapped or asymmetric blobs, leading to incorrect start/end (e.g., train1 includes extra top/bottom empty rows).
 * Column trimming after row selection is recomputed correctly in theory, but initial min_c/max_c uses untrimmed rows, causing width overestimation; this results in oversized squares with misplaced padding.
 * Height trimming when height > width removes low-density rows from ends, which works for borders but over-trims in train1 (cuts '3' borders) and train2 (distorts '3' and '4' shapes); the <2 non-zero check exacerbates this by removing sparse but essential rows.
 * Padding calculation (symmetric with //2) is mostly correct but fails due to wrong crop dimensions, leading to off-center or oversized outputs (e.g., train1 generated 18x18 vs expected 13x13).
 * All training examples fail: Train1 generated includes full-width empty borders and misses tight crop around central pattern (e.g., generated has wide left/right zeros, expected trims to 13 cols with specific '3','8','6' layout); Train2 generated shifts '3's and '4's incorrectly (e.g., row3 has '3's in wrong positions vs expected, and excludes some border '5's); Train3 generated flips or misaligns the central '1','2' pattern and includes extra '4' borders (e.g., row2 has isolated '1' misplaced vs expected tighter crop).
 * max_subarray_indices is helpful for dense contiguous cases but broken for non-contiguous (e.g., doesn't bridge small gaps in row_nonzero); the fallback all-zero grid is unhelpful and triggers incorrectly.
 * No connectivity check (e.g., flood-fill for main blob) means small isolated non-zeros (e.g., train2's stray '5's) pollute bounds; this is essential but missing.
 * Hardcoded n=20 assumes fixed size, which works for these inputs but limits generality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to crop a partial or multiple disconnected regions incorrectly, resulting in a tall, narrow 19x19? grid with scattered small patterns (e.g., isolated '5's and '3's in rows 1-4 and 10-14, a small '4' block in rows 12, and bottom '5' lines) instead of a single tight square bounding the main central blob.
 * It includes irrelevant top isolated '3's and '5's (rows 1-4), skips the dense mid-section (rows 6-8 with '5's), and fragments the lower '3'/'4'/'5' pattern (rows 10-18), suggesting over-trimming or wrong row_start/end; expected should consolidate the main lower-central pattern (e.g., the '3'/'4'/'5' cluster around rows 10-18, cols 10-18) into a ~9x9 square, excluding top noise.
 * Padding seems absent or asymmetric (many full-zero rows/cols), and the output isn't squared properly; it looks like multiple small objects were extracted separately rather than one main one, missing the puzzle's focus on the primary connected/dense region.
 * This indicates the density trimming fails on multi-blob inputs with varying densities, over-relying on max subarray without blob merging.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 09:21:22] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 09:42:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the input is a rectangular grid of integers (likely representing colored or patterned "pixels" in a larger canvas with empty space), and the goal is to extract, crop, and reformat the core content into a centered square grid of appropriate size, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while removing or padding around extraneous empty areas or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The core content appears to be a single main "object" or patterned block (e.g., a figure made of numbers like 3,8,6 in example 1, or 5,3,4 in example 2), often surrounded by empty (zero) rows/columns or decorative borders; the output must isolate this block without including outer noise.
 * Bounding box calculation must be tight: min/max rows and columns should only encompass the non-zero elements of the main object, but examples show that not all non-empty rows are part of the main block (e.g., isolated single rows like the top/bottom in example 1's expected output are excluded or repositioned).
 * Padding is centered and uses zeros, but the target size N is the max of row/col spans of the cropped block; however, outputs are sometimes not perfectly square or have asymmetric padding, suggesting the crop might include subtle extensions or exclude parts.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have multiple disconnected components (e.g., border-like lines of 3's or 5's in examples 1-3), but only the central/dense object is kept; empty rows within the block are preserved if they are part of the pattern. Rotations, mirrors, or value changes are not involved—outputs retain exact values and relative positions.
 * Outputs are always square (or padded to square), but input sizes vary (e.g., 13x13 in ex1, 11x11 in ex2/3); test input seems 13x13 with a central pattern of 3's,4's,5's flanked by 5's on sides.
 * Considerations across attempts: Longest consecutive non-empty rows may over-include if there are thin border rows; bounding columns must ignore outliers. No evidence of object extraction beyond simple bounding—complex shapes (e.g., holes or blobs) aren't handled yet. Padding order (rows then columns) can cause misalignment if crop is rectangular.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_non_empty_row(row: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    """Rule: Check if a row contains any non-zero value."""
    return any(x != 0 for x in row)
```
(This is useful for identifying potential content rows but may need refinement to detect main block vs. borders.)

```python
def find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.Tuple[int, int]:
    """Observation: Identify the longest sequence of consecutive non-empty rows in the grid."""
    # (Implementation as provided; helpful for initial row span but over-inclusive in examples.)
```
(This works for rough row detection but fails when borders create multiple sequences; could be extended to find densest block.)

```python
def find_bounding_columns(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int) -> tp.Tuple[int, int]:
    """Rule: Compute the minimum and maximum column indices with non-zero values in the main row block."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for column bounds but inherits row errors.)
```
(Good for tight horizontal cropping once rows are correct.)

```python
def crop_to_bounding_box(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Extract the subgrid from the bounding box of the main block."""
    # (Implementation as provided; core extraction tool, works if bounds are accurate.)
```
(Essential for isolating content; no issues here.)

```python
def compute_target_size(row_span: int, col_span: int) -> int:
    """Rule: Determine the side length of the square output grid as the maximum of row and column spans."""
    # (Implementation as provided; correct for squaring.)
```
(Simple and helpful.)

```python
def pad_rows_centered(grid: tp.List[tp.List[int]], target_n: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Pad the grid with empty rows centered to reach target size N."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful but can misalign if applied before full crop.)
```
(Helpful for vertical centering.)

```python
def pad_columns_centered(grid: tp.List[tp.List[int]], target_n: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Pad the grid with empty columns centered to reach target size N."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for horizontal centering.)
```
(Helpful for horizontal centering; order with row padding matters.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on finding the longest consecutive non-empty row block, cropping to its bounding columns, and padding to a square— this correctly identifies a dense central area but over-includes border-like rows (e.g., top/bottom rows of 3's in ex1 generated but shifted/partial in expected).
 * What worked: Cropping and padding mechanics produce square outputs with preserved values; bounding columns tighten horizontal span well (e.g., reduces wide empty sides).
 * What didn't work: Row selection via longest consecutive block includes extraneous borders, leading to taller-than-needed crops (e.g., ex1 generated 13 rows with mismatched top/bottom vs. expected 13 but different positioning); padding centers incorrectly due to wrong initial crop, causing shifts (e.g., ex1 row 0 has 3's in cols 2,4 but expected has them in 3,10).
 * Ex1 differences: Generated has extra 3's in row0 col4, row2 has 8's/3's misplaced vs. expected (e.g., expected row2: 3 at col1,8 at3, etc.; unknown why but likely border inclusion); row10 in generated has 8's/3's but expected has different 8 pattern—crop too wide vertically.
 * Ex2 differences: Generated includes isolated row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] and pads to 11x11 but expected excludes/repositions it, has row1 as all zeros except 3, and different internal shifts (e.g., generated row4 has 3's at1-2 but expected row3 has 3's at3-5); seems to miss central density focus.
 * Ex3 differences: Generated crops to include alternating border rows (e.g., rows 1-2,9-10 as 4/0 patterns) but expected excludes them, focusing on inner 1/2 block (e.g., expected starts with border but crops inner 8 rows tightly); generated row7 has 1's misplaced vs. expected row6.
 * No object extraction beyond bounding—may need functions to detect/ignore thin borders or find "main blob" via connectivity/density.
 * Function `find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows` is partially helpful but broken for multi-component grids (over-inclusive); keep but refine.
 * Padding functions are helpful and correct in isolation but unhelpful when chained after bad crop.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it crops to a 13x13 square with heavy top/bottom padding (empty rows 0-2,10-12) and includes side 5's (cols 0-1,11-12) as part of the main block, but the central pattern (3's frame around 4's) seems shifted left/down compared to input density; input has 5's only on sides of rows 4,6,8 but generated embeds them fully, suggesting over-cropping horizontally/vertically without excluding borders.
 * It misses subtlety of isolating the inner 3/4 pattern (likely the "object") while perhaps treating side 5's as noise; output has symmetric padding but the embedded block is 7 rows high (3-9) vs. input's scattered rows, indicating longest-block logic grabbed too much vertically but not centered properly.
 * To handle test: Need better main-block detection (e.g., ignore side columns with uniform 5's) and tighter vertical crop to rows 3-9, padding to ~9x9 or max span, then re-pad to square—current output looks like a bloated version of the input without true extraction.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to automatically detect, crop, and pad the central "object" or pattern (a connected or dense region of non-zero values representing shapes like numbers or symbols) to produce a tight, square bounding box output, removing empty borders while preserving the relative structure and values of the pattern. The input grids are larger (e.g., 20x20) with sparse non-zero elements forming the puzzle elements, and the output should be a smaller square grid (size determined by the bounding box) with zero-padding if needed to square it.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main pattern is a contiguous or near-contiguous blob of non-zero cells (e.g., digits like 3,8,6 representing filled pixels), often vertically or horizontally elongated, surrounded by large empty (zero) borders; cropping must tightly bound this blob without including irrelevant empty space or extraneous small features.
 * Row_nonzero counts (number of positive cells per row) are key for identifying dense rows, but the max subarray must handle cases where the blob isn't perfectly contiguous—subtle gaps (e.g., single zero rows/columns within the blob) should not split it if they are minimal.
 * Column bounding (min_c, max_c) must be recomputed after row trimming to avoid including outlier columns from trimmed rows; width/height calculation affects square sizing, where size = max(height, width), and padding is symmetric (//2 flooring).
 * Trimming logic for excess height (when height > width) should prioritize removing rows with fewer non-zeros, but avoid over-trimming if it cuts into the core pattern; additional checks for rows with <2 non-zeros help remove thin borders but can erroneously trim meaningful sparse rows in the pattern.
 * Patterns may have internal zeros (e.g., holes in '8's), so non-zero density alone isn't perfect—consider connectivity (e.g., flood fill for blobs) to distinguish main object from noise like isolated cells.
 * Square padding must center the cropped region, with pad_top/bottom/left/right calculated correctly; outputs must match exact expected sizes and positions, including preserving all non-zero values without alteration.
 * Subtle elements: Some patterns have asymmetric shapes (e.g., train1 has a central '8' with '3' borders and '6' insert); small disconnected components (e.g., train2's border '5's) should be excluded if not part of the main blob; rotations or symmetries in borders (e.g., train3's checkerboard '4's) may mislead density-based cropping.
 * Fallbacks for empty or invalid ranges (e.g., start > end) produce all-zero grids, but this shouldn't trigger on valid inputs; n=20 is hardcoded, assuming fixed input size.
 * All examples show the main pattern is roughly centered but offset, requiring dynamic detection rather than fixed coordinates.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    if n == 0:
        return 0, -1
    max_current = max_global = arr[0]
    current_start = 0
    global_start = 0
    global_end = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > max_current + arr[i]:
            max_current = arr[i]
            current_start = i
        else:
            max_current += arr[i]
        if max_current > max_global:
            max_global = max_current
            global_start = current_start
            global_end = i
    return global_start, global_end
```

    return [sum(x > 0 for x in row) for row in g]
```

(Note: No custom types like PuzzleElement are present; the above are core helpers from the attempt. No object extraction function is provided, but one could be added via flood-fill for connected components to better identify the main blob over density alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses density-based row selection (max subarray on row_nonzero) which works partially for finding core row ranges but fails to handle gapped or asymmetric blobs, leading to incorrect start/end (e.g., train1 includes extra top/bottom empty rows).
 * Column trimming after row selection is recomputed correctly in theory, but initial min_c/max_c uses untrimmed rows, causing width overestimation; this results in oversized squares with misplaced padding.
 * Height trimming when height > width removes low-density rows from ends, which works for borders but over-trims in train1 (cuts '3' borders) and train2 (distorts '3' and '4' shapes); the <2 non-zero check exacerbates this by removing sparse but essential rows.
 * Padding calculation (symmetric with //2) is mostly correct but fails due to wrong crop dimensions, leading to off-center or oversized outputs (e.g., train1 generated 18x18 vs expected 13x13).
 * All training examples fail: Train1 generated includes full-width empty borders and misses tight crop around central pattern (e.g., generated has wide left/right zeros, expected trims to 13 cols with specific '3','8','6' layout); Train2 generated shifts '3's and '4's incorrectly (e.g., row3 has '3's in wrong positions vs expected, and excludes some border '5's); Train3 generated flips or misaligns the central '1','2' pattern and includes extra '4' borders (e.g., row2 has isolated '1' misplaced vs expected tighter crop).
 * max_subarray_indices is helpful for dense contiguous cases but broken for non-contiguous (e.g., doesn't bridge small gaps in row_nonzero); the fallback all-zero grid is unhelpful and triggers incorrectly.
 * No connectivity check (e.g., flood-fill for main blob) means small isolated non-zeros (e.g., train2's stray '5's) pollute bounds; this is essential but missing.
 * Hardcoded n=20 assumes fixed size, which works for these inputs but limits generality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to crop a partial or multiple disconnected regions incorrectly, resulting in a tall, narrow 19x19? grid with scattered small patterns (e.g., isolated '5's and '3's in rows 1-4 and 10-14, a small '4' block in rows 12, and bottom '5' lines) instead of a single tight square bounding the main central blob.
 * It includes irrelevant top isolated '3's and '5's (rows 1-4), skips the dense mid-section (rows 6-8 with '5's), and fragments the lower '3'/'4'/'5' pattern (rows 10-18), suggesting over-trimming or wrong row_start/end; expected should consolidate the main lower-central pattern (e.g., the '3'/'4'/'5' cluster around rows 10-18, cols 10-18) into a ~9x9 square, excluding top noise.
 * Padding seems absent or asymmetric (many full-zero rows/cols), and the output isn't squared properly; it looks like multiple small objects were extracted separately rather than one main one, missing the puzzle's focus on the primary connected/dense region.
 * This indicates the density trimming fails on multi-blob inputs with varying densities, over-relying on max subarray without blob merging.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the input is a rectangular grid of integers (likely representing colored or patterned "pixels" in a larger canvas with empty space), and the goal is to extract, crop, and reformat the core content into a centered square grid of appropriate size, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while removing or padding around extraneous empty areas or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The core content appears to be a single main "object" or patterned block (e.g., a figure made of numbers like 3,8,6 in example 1, or 5,3,4 in example 2), often surrounded by empty (zero) rows/columns or decorative borders; the output must isolate this block without including outer noise.
 * Bounding box calculation must be tight: min/max rows and columns should only encompass the non-zero elements of the main object, but examples show that not all non-empty rows are part of the main block (e.g., isolated single rows like the top/bottom in example 1's expected output are excluded or repositioned).
 * Padding is centered and uses zeros, but the target size N is the max of row/col spans of the cropped block; however, outputs are sometimes not perfectly square or have asymmetric padding, suggesting the crop might include subtle extensions or exclude parts.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have multiple disconnected components (e.g., border-like lines of 3's or 5's in examples 1-3), but only the central/dense object is kept; empty rows within the block are preserved if they are part of the pattern. Rotations, mirrors, or value changes are not involved—outputs retain exact values and relative positions.
 * Outputs are always square (or padded to square), but input sizes vary (e.g., 13x13 in ex1, 11x11 in ex2/3); test input seems 13x13 with a central pattern of 3's,4's,5's flanked by 5's on sides.
 * Considerations across attempts: Longest consecutive non-empty rows may over-include if there are thin border rows; bounding columns must ignore outliers. No evidence of object extraction beyond simple bounding—complex shapes (e.g., holes or blobs) aren't handled yet. Padding order (rows then columns) can cause misalignment if crop is rectangular.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_non_empty_row(row: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    """Rule: Check if a row contains any non-zero value."""
    return any(x != 0 for x in row)
```
(This is useful for identifying potential content rows but may need refinement to detect main block vs. borders.)

```python
def find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.Tuple[int, int]:
    """Observation: Identify the longest sequence of consecutive non-empty rows in the grid."""
    # (Implementation as provided; helpful for initial row span but over-inclusive in examples.)
```
(This works for rough row detection but fails when borders create multiple sequences; could be extended to find densest block.)

```python
def find_bounding_columns(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int) -> tp.Tuple[int, int]:
    """Rule: Compute the minimum and maximum column indices with non-zero values in the main row block."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for column bounds but inherits row errors.)
```
(Good for tight horizontal cropping once rows are correct.)

```python
def crop_to_bounding_box(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Extract the subgrid from the bounding box of the main block."""
    # (Implementation as provided; core extraction tool, works if bounds are accurate.)

    """Rule: Determine the side length of the square output grid as the maximum of row and column spans."""
    # (Implementation as provided; correct for squaring.)
```
(Simple and helpful.)

```python
def pad_rows_centered(grid: tp.List[tp.List[int]], target_n: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Pad the grid with empty rows centered to reach target size N."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful but can misalign if applied before full crop.)
```
(Helpful for vertical centering.)

```python
def pad_columns_centered(grid: tp.List[tp.List[int]], target_n: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Pad the grid with empty columns centered to reach target size N."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for horizontal centering.)
```
(Helpful for horizontal centering; order with row padding matters.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on finding the longest consecutive non-empty row block, cropping to its bounding columns, and padding to a square— this correctly identifies a dense central area but over-includes border-like rows (e.g., top/bottom rows of 3's in ex1 generated but shifted/partial in expected).
 * What worked: Cropping and padding mechanics produce square outputs with preserved values; bounding columns tighten horizontal span well (e.g., reduces wide empty sides).
 * What didn't work: Row selection via longest consecutive block includes extraneous borders, leading to taller-than-needed crops (e.g., ex1 generated 13 rows with mismatched top/bottom vs. expected 13 but different positioning); padding centers incorrectly due to wrong initial crop, causing shifts (e.g., ex1 row 0 has 3's in cols 2,4 but expected has them in 3,10).
 * Ex1 differences: Generated has extra 3's in row0 col4, row2 has 8's/3's misplaced vs. expected (e.g., expected row2: 3 at col1,8 at3, etc.; unknown why but likely border inclusion); row10 in generated has 8's/3's but expected has different 8 pattern—crop too wide vertically.
 * Ex2 differences: Generated includes isolated row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] and pads to 11x11 but expected excludes/repositions it, has row1 as all zeros except 3, and different internal shifts (e.g., generated row4 has 3's at1-2 but expected row3 has 3's at3-5); seems to miss central density focus.
 * Ex3 differences: Generated crops to include alternating border rows (e.g., rows 1-2,9-10 as 4/0 patterns) but expected excludes them, focusing on inner 1/2 block (e.g., expected starts with border but crops inner 8 rows tightly); generated row7 has 1's misplaced vs. expected row6.
 * No object extraction beyond bounding—may need functions to detect/ignore thin borders or find "main blob" via connectivity/density.
 * Function `find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows` is partially helpful but broken for multi-component grids (over-inclusive); keep but refine.
 * Padding functions are helpful and correct in isolation but unhelpful when chained after bad crop.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it crops to a 13x13 square with heavy top/bottom padding (empty rows 0-2,10-12) and includes side 5's (cols 0-1,11-12) as part of the main block, but the central pattern (3's frame around 4's) seems shifted left/down compared to input density; input has 5's only on sides of rows 4,6,8 but generated embeds them fully, suggesting over-cropping horizontally/vertically without excluding borders.
 * It misses subtlety of isolating the inner 3/4 pattern (likely the "object") while perhaps treating side 5's as noise; output has symmetric padding but the embedded block is 7 rows high (3-9) vs. input's scattered rows, indicating longest-block logic grabbed too much vertically but not centered properly.
 * To handle test: Need better main-block detection (e.g., ignore side columns with uniform 5's) and tighter vertical crop to rows 3-9, padding to ~9x9 or max span, then re-pad to square—current output looks like a bloated version of the input without true extraction.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input.

If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 09:50:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to clean up a grid by isolating the core pattern or "object" (e.g., letters, shapes, or symbols formed by non-zero cells) while removing surrounding noise, borders, or extraneous connected elements, then cropping tightly and padding to a centered square if needed. The process emphasizes distinguishing the main blob from decorative or irregular borders that are often connected but should be excluded to match the expected clean, minimal representations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids often have outer borders (e.g., 3's in example 1, 5's in example 2, 4's in example 3) that form connected components of non-zero cells but are noise; the main pattern is typically an inner, denser, or more structured blob that may not be the absolute largest component.
 * Use 8-connectivity for components to capture diagonal connections in patterns like letters or shapes, but avoid merging borders with the core if they touch—subtlety is detecting "frame-like" structures vs. solid fills.
 * Cropping must be to the tight bounding box of the main component only, preserving internal zeros (holes or gaps) but excluding isolated noise within the crop if it's not part of the pattern.
 * Padding to square uses the max dimension, centered symmetrically, with zeros; however, if the input is already square-like, no padding occurs, but the core issue is often pre-padding cleanup.
 * Expected outputs show irregular borders adjusted (e.g., some border cells zeroed out or shifted), suggesting rules like removing single-cell protrusions, handling asymmetric noise, or prioritizing components by density/shape over size.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have internal components (e.g., holes with 0's inside non-zeros) that must stay; borders may not fully enclose (e.g., gaps in test input); values like 3,4,5,6,8 represent different "inks" but connectivity is by non-zero regardless of value.
 * All non-zero cells are treated equally for connectivity, but outputs preserve original values—don't normalize or change them.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return empty; small isolated cells are noise; multiple components require selecting the "primary" one (not always largest, as borders can be bigger).
 * Considerations across attempts: Flood fill/DFS is reliable for components but needs filtering (e.g., by size threshold, perimeter-to-area ratio for "frame" detection, or excluding components touching grid edges).

    max_c = max(c for r, c in component)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented connected components, bounding box cropping, and centered square padding, which worked for basic structure preservation and output formatting (e.g., kept internal values and zeros intact).
 * What didn't work: Relied on the largest component, which included borders/noise (e.g., full 3-border in train 1 generated vs. expected irregular/partial border with some 0's and shifted positions; similar for 5-borders in train 2 and 4-borders in train 3), leading to oversized crops that retained unwanted elements.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 3's in top/bottom rows (e.g., full row of 3's in row 1/11 vs. expected sparse 3's and 0's); internal 8's and 6's shifted or added erroneously (e.g., row 2 has 8's where expected has 0's); bottom row has misplaced 3's.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated includes border 5's bleeding into inner pattern (e.g., row 3 has 3's in cols 1-2 where expected has 0's; row 4 has extra 3's and missing 4's in positions); row 1 has 3 where expected has all 0's except end.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated rotates or includes border as part of pattern (e.g., row 0 starts with 4's alternating vs. expected starting with 0; inner 1's and 2's misplaced, like row 2 has extra 0's and 1's shifted); overall looks like border merged without exclusion.
 * Function `get_largest_component` is broken/not helpful as-is (always picks size-max, ignoring border-like components; suggest filtering by not touching edges or by shape metrics).
 * Padding functions (e.g., `calculate_vertical_padding`, `apply_padding`) are helpful and correct but underutilized since crops are too large, resulting in no/minimal padding.
 * `crop_to_bounds` preserves isolated cells within bounds (good), but since wrong component is chosen, it includes noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output matches the input grid exactly (7x7 with irregular 3/4 border and inner pattern), which does not look correct because prior training examples show the need for cleanup—likely the expected output should exclude or zero out the incomplete border (e.g., top-left 3's in rows 0-1 might be noise, inner 4 as main, with tighter crop/pad to square without edge protrusions like row 6's lone 3).
 * It makes sense as a "no-op" from the program's logic (largest component spans nearly whole grid, bounding box is full 7x7, no padding needed), but fails the puzzle's intent since borders aren't removed, leading to unclean pattern (e.g., asymmetric 0's and 3's around the central 4 and lines).
 * To handle test: Program needs border exclusion (e.g., ignore components touching all four edges) to crop just the inner cross-like pattern with 4, padding to square if height/width differ after cleanup.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 09:50:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to automatically detect, crop, and pad the central "object" or pattern (a connected or dense region of non-zero values representing shapes like numbers or symbols) to produce a tight, square bounding box output, removing empty borders while preserving the relative structure and values of the pattern. The input grids are larger (e.g., 20x20) with sparse non-zero elements forming the puzzle elements, and the output should be a smaller square grid (size determined by the bounding box) with zero-padding if needed to square it.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main pattern is a contiguous or near-contiguous blob of non-zero cells (e.g., digits like 3,8,6 representing filled pixels), often vertically or horizontally elongated, surrounded by large empty (zero) borders; cropping must tightly bound this blob without including irrelevant empty space or extraneous small features.
 * Row_nonzero counts (number of positive cells per row) are key for identifying dense rows, but the max subarray must handle cases where the blob isn't perfectly contiguous—subtle gaps (e.g., single zero rows/columns within the blob) should not split it if they are minimal.
 * Column bounding (min_c, max_c) must be recomputed after row trimming to avoid including outlier columns from trimmed rows; width/height calculation affects square sizing, where size = max(height, width), and padding is symmetric (//2 flooring).
 * Trimming logic for excess height (when height > width) should prioritize removing rows with fewer non-zeros, but avoid over-trimming if it cuts into the core pattern; additional checks for rows with <2 non-zeros help remove thin borders but can erroneously trim meaningful sparse rows in the pattern.
 * Patterns may have internal zeros (e.g., holes in '8's), so non-zero density alone isn't perfect—consider connectivity (e.g., flood fill for blobs) to distinguish main object from noise like isolated cells.
 * Square padding must center the cropped region, with pad_top/bottom/left/right calculated correctly; outputs must match exact expected sizes and positions, including preserving all non-zero values without alteration.
 * Subtle elements: Some patterns have asymmetric shapes (e.g., train1 has a central '8' with '3' borders and '6' insert); small disconnected components (e.g., train2's border '5's) should be excluded if not part of the main blob; rotations or symmetries in borders (e.g., train3's checkerboard '4's) may mislead density-based cropping.
 * Fallbacks for empty or invalid ranges (e.g., start > end) produce all-zero grids, but this shouldn't trigger on valid inputs; n=20 is hardcoded, assuming fixed input size.
 * All examples show the main pattern is roughly centered but offset, requiring dynamic detection rather than fixed coordinates.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def max_subarray_indices(arr: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Kadane's algorithm variant to find start/end indices of max sum subarray in row_nonzero.
    Useful for identifying contiguous dense row ranges, but may need adaptation for gapped blobs.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return 0, -1
    max_current = max_global = arr[0]
    current_start = 0
    global_start = 0
    global_end = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > max_current + arr[i]:
            max_current = arr[i]
            current_start = i
        else:
            max_current += arr[i]
        if max_current > max_global:
            max_global = max_current
            global_start = current_start
            global_end = i
    return global_start, global_end
```

```python
def compute_row_nonzero(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Computes count of >0 cells per row; essential for density-based row selection.
    """
    n = len(g)
    return [sum(x > 0 for x in row) for row in g]
```

(Note: No custom types like PuzzleElement are present; the above are core helpers from the attempt. No object extraction function is provided, but one could be added via flood-fill for connected components to better identify the main blob over density alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses density-based row selection (max subarray on row_nonzero) which works partially for finding core row ranges but fails to handle gapped or asymmetric blobs, leading to incorrect start/end (e.g., train1 includes extra top/bottom empty rows).
 * Column trimming after row selection is recomputed correctly in theory, but initial min_c/max_c uses untrimmed rows, causing width overestimation; this results in oversized squares with misplaced padding.
 * Height trimming when height > width removes low-density rows from ends, which works for borders but over-trims in train1 (cuts '3' borders) and train2 (distorts '3' and '4' shapes); the <2 non-zero check exacerbates this by removing sparse but essential rows.
 * Padding calculation (symmetric with //2) is mostly correct but fails due to wrong crop dimensions, leading to off-center or oversized outputs (e.g., train1 generated 18x18 vs expected 13x13).
 * All training examples fail: Train1 generated includes full-width empty borders and misses tight crop around central pattern (e.g., generated has wide left/right zeros, expected trims to 13 cols with specific '3','8','6' layout); Train2 generated shifts '3's and '4's incorrectly (e.g., row3 has '3's in wrong positions vs expected, and excludes some border '5's); Train3 generated flips or misaligns the central '1','2' pattern and includes extra '4' borders (e.g., row2 has isolated '1' misplaced vs expected tighter crop).
 * max_subarray_indices is helpful for dense contiguous cases but broken for non-contiguous (e.g., doesn't bridge small gaps in row_nonzero); the fallback all-zero grid is unhelpful and triggers incorrectly.
 * No connectivity check (e.g., flood-fill for main blob) means small isolated non-zeros (e.g., train2's stray '5's) pollute bounds; this is essential but missing.
 * Hardcoded n=20 assumes fixed size, which works for these inputs but limits generality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to crop a partial or multiple disconnected regions incorrectly, resulting in a tall, narrow 19x19? grid with scattered small patterns (e.g., isolated '5's and '3's in rows 1-4 and 10-14, a small '4' block in rows 12, and bottom '5' lines) instead of a single tight square bounding the main central blob.
 * It includes irrelevant top isolated '3's and '5's (rows 1-4), skips the dense mid-section (rows 6-8 with '5's), and fragments the lower '3'/'4'/'5' pattern (rows 10-18), suggesting over-trimming or wrong row_start/end; expected should consolidate the main lower-central pattern (e.g., the '3'/'4'/'5' cluster around rows 10-18, cols 10-18) into a ~9x9 square, excluding top noise.
 * Padding seems absent or asymmetric (many full-zero rows/cols), and the output isn't squared properly; it looks like multiple small objects were extracted separately rather than one main one, missing the puzzle's focus on the primary connected/dense region.
 * This indicates the density trimming fails on multi-blob inputs with varying densities, over-relying on max subarray without blob merging.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the input is a rectangular grid of integers (likely representing colored or patterned "pixels" in a larger canvas with empty space), and the goal is to extract, crop, and reformat the core content into a centered square grid of appropriate size, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while removing or padding around extraneous empty areas or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The core content appears to be a single main "object" or patterned block (e.g., a figure made of numbers like 3,8,6 in example 1, or 5,3,4 in example 2), often surrounded by empty (zero) rows/columns or decorative borders; the output must isolate this block without including outer noise.
 * Bounding box calculation must be tight: min/max rows and columns should only encompass the non-zero elements of the main object, but examples show that not all non-empty rows are part of the main block (e.g., isolated single rows like the top/bottom in example 1's expected output are excluded or repositioned).
 * Padding is centered and uses zeros, but the target size N is the max of row/col spans of the cropped block; however, outputs are sometimes not perfectly square or have asymmetric padding, suggesting the crop might include subtle extensions or exclude parts.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have multiple disconnected components (e.g., border-like lines of 3's or 5's in examples 1-3), but only the central/dense object is kept; empty rows within the block are preserved if they are part of the pattern. Rotations, mirrors, or value changes are not involved—outputs retain exact values and relative positions.
 * Outputs are always square (or padded to square), but input sizes vary (e.g., 13x13 in ex1, 11x11 in ex2/3); test input seems 13x13 with a central pattern of 3's,4's,5's flanked by 5's on sides.
 * Considerations across attempts: Longest consecutive non-empty rows may over-include if there are thin border rows; bounding columns must ignore outliers. No evidence of object extraction beyond simple bounding—complex shapes (e.g., holes or blobs) aren't handled yet. Padding order (rows then columns) can cause misalignment if crop is rectangular.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_non_empty_row(row: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    """Rule: Check if a row contains any non-zero value."""
    return any(x != 0 for x in row)
```
(This is useful for identifying potential content rows but may need refinement to detect main block vs. borders.)

```python
def find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.Tuple[int, int]:
    """Observation: Identify the longest sequence of consecutive non-empty rows in the grid."""
    # (Implementation as provided; helpful for initial row span but over-inclusive in examples.)
```
(This works for rough row detection but fails when borders create multiple sequences; could be extended to find densest block.)

```python
def find_bounding_columns(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int) -> tp.Tuple[int, int]:
    """Rule: Compute the minimum and maximum column indices with non-zero values in the main row block."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for column bounds but inherits row errors.)
```
(Good for tight horizontal cropping once rows are correct.)

```python
def crop_to_bounding_box(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Extract the subgrid from the bounding box of the main block."""
    # (Implementation as provided; core extraction tool, works if bounds are accurate.)
```
(Essential for isolating content; no issues here.)

```python
def compute_target_size(row_span: int, col_span: int) -> int:
    """Rule: Determine the side length of the square output grid as the maximum of row and column spans."""
    # (Implementation as provided; correct for squaring.)
```
(Simple and helpful.)

```python
def pad_rows_centered(grid: tp.List[tp.List[int]], target_n: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Pad the grid with empty rows centered to reach target size N."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful but can misalign if applied before full crop.)
```
(Helpful for vertical centering.)

```python
def pad_columns_centered(grid: tp.List[tp.List[int]], target_n: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Pad the grid with empty columns centered to reach target size N."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for horizontal centering.)
```
(Helpful for horizontal centering; order with row padding matters.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on finding the longest consecutive non-empty row block, cropping to its bounding columns, and padding to a square— this correctly identifies a dense central area but over-includes border-like rows (e.g., top/bottom rows of 3's in ex1 generated but shifted/partial in expected).
 * What worked: Cropping and padding mechanics produce square outputs with preserved values; bounding columns tighten horizontal span well (e.g., reduces wide empty sides).
 * What didn't work: Row selection via longest consecutive block includes extraneous borders, leading to taller-than-needed crops (e.g., ex1 generated 13 rows with mismatched top/bottom vs. expected 13 but different positioning); padding centers incorrectly due to wrong initial crop, causing shifts (e.g., ex1 row 0 has 3's in cols 2,4 but expected has them in 3,10).
 * Ex1 differences: Generated has extra 3's in row0 col4, row2 has 8's/3's misplaced vs. expected (e.g., expected row2: 3 at col1,8 at3, etc.; unknown why but likely border inclusion); row10 in generated has 8's/3's but expected has different 8 pattern—crop too wide vertically.
 * Ex2 differences: Generated includes isolated row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] and pads to 11x11 but expected excludes/repositions it, has row1 as all zeros except 3, and different internal shifts (e.g., generated row4 has 3's at1-2 but expected row3 has 3's at3-5); seems to miss central density focus.
 * Ex3 differences: Generated crops to include alternating border rows (e.g., rows 1-2,9-10 as 4/0 patterns) but expected excludes them, focusing on inner 1/2 block (e.g., expected starts with border but crops inner 8 rows tightly); generated row7 has 1's misplaced vs. expected row6.
 * No object extraction beyond bounding—may need functions to detect/ignore thin borders or find "main blob" via connectivity/density.
 * Function `find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows` is partially helpful but broken for multi-component grids (over-inclusive); keep but refine.
 * Padding functions are helpful and correct in isolation but unhelpful when chained after bad crop.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it crops to a 13x13 square with heavy top/bottom padding (empty rows 0-2,10-12) and includes side 5's (cols 0-1,11-12) as part of the main block, but the central pattern (3's frame around 4's) seems shifted left/down compared to input density; input has 5's only on sides of rows 4,6,8 but generated embeds them fully, suggesting over-cropping horizontally/vertically without excluding borders.
 * It misses subtlety of isolating the inner 3/4 pattern (likely the "object") while perhaps treating side 5's as noise; output has symmetric padding but the embedded block is 7 rows high (3-9) vs. input's scattered rows, indicating longest-block logic grabbed too much vertically but not centered properly.
 * To handle test: Need better main-block detection (e.g., ignore side columns with uniform 5's) and tighter vertical crop to rows 3-9, padding to ~9x9 or max span, then re-pad to square—current output looks like a bloated version of the input without true extraction.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to clean up a grid by isolating the core pattern or "object" (e.g., letters, shapes, or symbols formed by non-zero cells) while removing surrounding noise, borders, or extraneous connected elements, then cropping tightly and padding to a centered square if needed. The process emphasizes distinguishing the main blob from decorative or irregular borders that are often connected but should be excluded to match the expected clean, minimal representations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids often have outer borders (e.g., 3's in example 1, 5's in example 2, 4's in example 3) that form connected components of non-zero cells but are noise; the main pattern is typically an inner, denser, or more structured blob that may not be the absolute largest component.
 * Use 8-connectivity for components to capture diagonal connections in patterns like letters or shapes, but avoid merging borders with the core if they touch—subtlety is detecting "frame-like" structures vs. solid fills.
 * Cropping must be to the tight bounding box of the main component only, preserving internal zeros (holes or gaps) but excluding isolated noise within the crop if it's not part of the pattern.
 * Padding to square uses the max dimension, centered symmetrically, with zeros; however, if the input is already square-like, no padding occurs, but the core issue is often pre-padding cleanup.
 * Expected outputs show irregular borders adjusted (e.g., some border cells zeroed out or shifted), suggesting rules like removing single-cell protrusions, handling asymmetric noise, or prioritizing components by density/shape over size.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have internal components (e.g., holes with 0's inside non-zeros) that must stay; borders may not fully enclose (e.g., gaps in test input); values like 3,4,5,6,8 represent different "inks" but connectivity is by non-zero regardless of value.
 * All non-zero cells are treated equally for connectivity, but outputs preserve original values—don't normalize or change them.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return empty; small isolated cells are noise; multiple components require selecting the "primary" one (not always largest, as borders can be bigger).
 * Considerations across attempts: Flood fill/DFS is reliable for components but needs filtering (e.g., by size threshold, perimeter-to-area ratio for "frame" detection, or excluding components touching grid edges).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented connected components, bounding box cropping, and centered square padding, which worked for basic structure preservation and output formatting (e.g., kept internal values and zeros intact).
 * What didn't work: Relied on the largest component, which included borders/noise (e.g., full 3-border in train 1 generated vs. expected irregular/partial border with some 0's and shifted positions; similar for 5-borders in train 2 and 4-borders in train 3), leading to oversized crops that retained unwanted elements.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 3's in top/bottom rows (e.g., full row of 3's in row 1/11 vs. expected sparse 3's and 0's); internal 8's and 6's shifted or added erroneously (e.g., row 2 has 8's where expected has 0's); bottom row has misplaced 3's.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated includes border 5's bleeding into inner pattern (e.g., row 3 has 3's in cols 1-2 where expected has 0's; row 4 has extra 3's and missing 4's in positions); row 1 has 3 where expected has all 0's except end.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated rotates or includes border as part of pattern (e.g., row 0 starts with 4's alternating vs. expected starting with 0; inner 1's and 2's misplaced, like row 2 has extra 0's and 1's shifted); overall looks like border merged without exclusion.
 * Function `get_largest_component` is broken/not helpful as-is (always picks size-max, ignoring border-like components; suggest filtering by not touching edges or by shape metrics).
 * Padding functions (e.g., `calculate_vertical_padding`, `apply_padding`) are helpful and correct but underutilized since crops are too large, resulting in no/minimal padding.
 * `crop_to_bounds` preserves isolated cells within bounds (good), but since wrong component is chosen, it includes noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output matches the input grid exactly (7x7 with irregular 3/4 border and inner pattern), which does not look correct because prior training examples show the need for cleanup—likely the expected output should exclude or zero out the incomplete border (e.g., top-left 3's in rows 0-1 might be noise, inner 4 as main, with tighter crop/pad to square without edge protrusions like row 6's lone 3).
 * It makes sense as a "no-op" from the program's logic (largest component spans nearly whole grid, bounding box is full 7x7, no padding needed), but fails the puzzle's intent since borders aren't removed, leading to unclean pattern (e.g., asymmetric 0's and 3's around the central 4 and lines).
 * To handle test: Program needs border exclusion (e.g., ignore components touching all four edges) to crop just the inner cross-like pattern with 4, padding to square if height/width differ after cleanup.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input generated output:
[5, 5]
[0, 0]
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:07:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to process a square grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like values for shapes or images) by identifying and extracting the "main" non-zero connected component (object), cropping to its tight bounding box, and padding it to a square while preserving the original values and structure. The challenge involves correctly defining connectivity (8-connected), selecting the right component (central and largest), handling borders/frames that might connect to or surround the main object, and ensuring the extraction matches subtle positional details without introducing artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connectivity for components (diagonal neighbors count as connected), as non-zero cells can touch diagonally to form a single object.
 * The "main" component is typically the one closest to the grid center (measured by bounding box center distance to grid center), with ties broken by size (largest area); ignore small or peripheral components like borders or noise.
 * Borders or frames (e.g., repeating patterns of 3's or 4's around the edges) often form separate components or might connect to the main object, but they should be excluded—do not include them in the extraction unless they are part of the central shape.
 * After extracting the subgrid via bounding box, pad to the smallest square that fits (side length = max(height, width of subgrid)), centering the content with zeros; padding must be symmetric where possible but can be uneven if dimensions require it.
 * Grids may have multiple distinct values (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6 for object parts, 4/1/2 for shapes), but treat all non-zero as connectable regardless of value—do not segment by value.
 * Subtle positional mismatches occur frequently: e.g., in rotations or irregular shapes, the bounding box might shift, causing rows/columns to align differently; ensure the extracted subgrid retains exact relative positions.
 * Handle empty or single-cell cases gracefully (return zero-padded grid if no component).
 * Grids are always square input (n x n), but output must also be square (possibly smaller effective size after padding).
 * Easy to miss: Components might not be fully enclosed; test for cases where the main object touches the border, requiring careful separation; also, center calculation uses floating-point bounding box midpoint, so use precise distance formula.
 * Padding centers the subgrid, so calculate top/left pads as floor((n - dim)/2), with remainder on bottom/right.
 * Visually, outputs should "zoom in" on the central irregular shape, removing outer frames, but preserving internal details like holes or protrusions (e.g., isolated 6's or 8's).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implements 8-connected DFS for components, bounding box calculation, central selection with distance tiebreaker, subgrid extraction, and centered zero-padding—these are solid building blocks and worked for basic structure but failed to isolate the main object properly.
 * What worked: Component detection accurately finds non-zero groups (e.g., in example 1, it grabs a large central blob with 8's and 6's); padding centers content without distortion; handles empty cases by returning zero grid.
 * What didn't work: In all training examples, it incorrectly includes or excludes parts of the main object due to over-merging with borders (e.g., in example 1, generated includes extra 3's on left/top as part of the component, shifting the entire shape right/down compared to expected, where top row has 3's more centered and bottom has isolated 3's in columns 6-7; differences include row 0: generated [0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]—extra 3's and misaligned; row 2: generated has 8's starting earlier; row 10: generated [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,3,0]—missing 8's in positions 2-5, extra in 9; unknown why bounding box expanded to include border 3's, perhaps partial connectivity).
 * In example 2, generated mismatches inner 3's and 4's positions (e.g., row 1: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—3 shifted right; row 3: generated [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—extra 3's in cols 1-2, missing in 8; row 4: generated has 3's in 2 and 8 vs expected 3's in 1-2; likely selected a component that merged border 5's incorrectly with inner shapes).
 * In example 3, generated treats the 4's frame as part of or adjacent to the central 1/2 component, resulting in a larger bounding box that includes the entire frame (e.g., row 0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—starts with 4 instead of 0, and pattern is shifted; row 2: generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] includes frame 4's at ends vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] which crops tighter, starting inner content earlier; row 5: generated [0,4,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,4] vs expected [4,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,4,0]—rotated or flipped feel, with 4's misplaced; unknown exact cause, but likely frame 4's form a connected ring around the center, pulling the bounding box outward).
 * Overall, the attempt overestimates the main component by including border-connected cells, leading to shifted/wider outputs; selection metric works but needs refinement to explicitly exclude border-like components (e.g., those touching edges).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and mostly correct, though the full program() integrates them poorly for border separation; do not discard, but enhance select_main_component to penalize edge-touching components.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output [[5,5],[0,0]] appears correct at first glance for a tiny 2x2 input grid (assuming input is [[5,5],[0,0]]), as the non-zero cells [5,5] in row 0 form a connected component (side-by-side, 8-connected), bounding box is row 0 col 0-1, extraction is [[5,5]], padding to 2x2 adds [0,0] below, matching exactly—no border issues here since it's small and no extraneous components.
 * However, it only "makes sense" if the puzzle rules apply uniformly; for larger cases, this simple pass doesn't demonstrate handling of the core subtlety (border exclusion), so it might coincidentally work but not generalize—watch for tests with frames around small objects, where it could wrongly include them and shift the [5,5] row.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 10:07:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to automatically detect, crop, and pad the central "object" or pattern (a connected or dense region of non-zero values representing shapes like numbers or symbols) to produce a tight, square bounding box output, removing empty borders while preserving the relative structure and values of the pattern. The input grids are larger (e.g., 20x20) with sparse non-zero elements forming the puzzle elements, and the output should be a smaller square grid (size determined by the bounding box) with zero-padding if needed to square it.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main pattern is a contiguous or near-contiguous blob of non-zero cells (e.g., digits like 3,8,6 representing filled pixels), often vertically or horizontally elongated, surrounded by large empty (zero) borders; cropping must tightly bound this blob without including irrelevant empty space or extraneous small features.
 * Row_nonzero counts (number of positive cells per row) are key for identifying dense rows, but the max subarray must handle cases where the blob isn't perfectly contiguous—subtle gaps (e.g., single zero rows/columns within the blob) should not split it if they are minimal.
 * Column bounding (min_c, max_c) must be recomputed after row trimming to avoid including outlier columns from trimmed rows; width/height calculation affects square sizing, where size = max(height, width), and padding is symmetric (//2 flooring).
 * Trimming logic for excess height (when height > width) should prioritize removing rows with fewer non-zeros, but avoid over-trimming if it cuts into the core pattern; additional checks for rows with <2 non-zeros help remove thin borders but can erroneously trim meaningful sparse rows in the pattern.
 * Patterns may have internal zeros (e.g., holes in '8's), so non-zero density alone isn't perfect—consider connectivity (e.g., flood fill for blobs) to distinguish main object from noise like isolated cells.
 * Square padding must center the cropped region, with pad_top/bottom/left/right calculated correctly; outputs must match exact expected sizes and positions, including preserving all non-zero values without alteration.
 * Subtle elements: Some patterns have asymmetric shapes (e.g., train1 has a central '8' with '3' borders and '6' insert); small disconnected components (e.g., train2's border '5's) should be excluded if not part of the main blob; rotations or symmetries in borders (e.g., train3's checkerboard '4's) may mislead density-based cropping.
 * Fallbacks for empty or invalid ranges (e.g., start > end) produce all-zero grids, but this shouldn't trigger on valid inputs; n=20 is hardcoded, assuming fixed input size.
 * All examples show the main pattern is roughly centered but offset, requiring dynamic detection rather than fixed coordinates.

    if n == 0:
        return 0, -1
    max_current = max_global = arr[0]
    current_start = 0
    global_start = 0
    global_end = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > max_current + arr[i]:
            max_current = arr[i]
            current_start = i
        else:
            max_current += arr[i]
        if max_current > max_global:
            max_global = max_current
            global_start = current_start
            global_end = i
    return global_start, global_end
```

def compute_row_nonzero(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """

    """
    n = len(g)
    return [sum(x > 0 for x in row) for row in g]
```

(Note: No custom types like PuzzleElement are present; the above are core helpers from the attempt. No object extraction function is provided, but one could be added via flood-fill for connected components to better identify the main blob over density alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses density-based row selection (max subarray on row_nonzero) which works partially for finding core row ranges but fails to handle gapped or asymmetric blobs, leading to incorrect start/end (e.g., train1 includes extra top/bottom empty rows).
 * Column trimming after row selection is recomputed correctly in theory, but initial min_c/max_c uses untrimmed rows, causing width overestimation; this results in oversized squares with misplaced padding.
 * Height trimming when height > width removes low-density rows from ends, which works for borders but over-trims in train1 (cuts '3' borders) and train2 (distorts '3' and '4' shapes); the <2 non-zero check exacerbates this by removing sparse but essential rows.
 * Padding calculation (symmetric with //2) is mostly correct but fails due to wrong crop dimensions, leading to off-center or oversized outputs (e.g., train1 generated 18x18 vs expected 13x13).
 * All training examples fail: Train1 generated includes full-width empty borders and misses tight crop around central pattern (e.g., generated has wide left/right zeros, expected trims to 13 cols with specific '3','8','6' layout); Train2 generated shifts '3's and '4's incorrectly (e.g., row3 has '3's in wrong positions vs expected, and excludes some border '5's); Train3 generated flips or misaligns the central '1','2' pattern and includes extra '4' borders (e.g., row2 has isolated '1' misplaced vs expected tighter crop).
 * max_subarray_indices is helpful for dense contiguous cases but broken for non-contiguous (e.g., doesn't bridge small gaps in row_nonzero); the fallback all-zero grid is unhelpful and triggers incorrectly.
 * No connectivity check (e.g., flood-fill for main blob) means small isolated non-zeros (e.g., train2's stray '5's) pollute bounds; this is essential but missing.
 * Hardcoded n=20 assumes fixed size, which works for these inputs but limits generality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to crop a partial or multiple disconnected regions incorrectly, resulting in a tall, narrow 19x19? grid with scattered small patterns (e.g., isolated '5's and '3's in rows 1-4 and 10-14, a small '4' block in rows 12, and bottom '5' lines) instead of a single tight square bounding the main central blob.
 * It includes irrelevant top isolated '3's and '5's (rows 1-4), skips the dense mid-section (rows 6-8 with '5's), and fragments the lower '3'/'4'/'5' pattern (rows 10-18), suggesting over-trimming or wrong row_start/end; expected should consolidate the main lower-central pattern (e.g., the '3'/'4'/'5' cluster around rows 10-18, cols 10-18) into a ~9x9 square, excluding top noise.
 * Padding seems absent or asymmetric (many full-zero rows/cols), and the output isn't squared properly; it looks like multiple small objects were extracted separately rather than one main one, missing the puzzle's focus on the primary connected/dense region.
 * This indicates the density trimming fails on multi-blob inputs with varying densities, over-relying on max subarray without blob merging.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the input is a rectangular grid of integers (likely representing colored or patterned "pixels" in a larger canvas with empty space), and the goal is to extract, crop, and reformat the core content into a centered square grid of appropriate size, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while removing or padding around extraneous empty areas or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The core content appears to be a single main "object" or patterned block (e.g., a figure made of numbers like 3,8,6 in example 1, or 5,3,4 in example 2), often surrounded by empty (zero) rows/columns or decorative borders; the output must isolate this block without including outer noise.
 * Bounding box calculation must be tight: min/max rows and columns should only encompass the non-zero elements of the main object, but examples show that not all non-empty rows are part of the main block (e.g., isolated single rows like the top/bottom in example 1's expected output are excluded or repositioned).
 * Padding is centered and uses zeros, but the target size N is the max of row/col spans of the cropped block; however, outputs are sometimes not perfectly square or have asymmetric padding, suggesting the crop might include subtle extensions or exclude parts.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have multiple disconnected components (e.g., border-like lines of 3's or 5's in examples 1-3), but only the central/dense object is kept; empty rows within the block are preserved if they are part of the pattern. Rotations, mirrors, or value changes are not involved—outputs retain exact values and relative positions.
 * Outputs are always square (or padded to square), but input sizes vary (e.g., 13x13 in ex1, 11x11 in ex2/3); test input seems 13x13 with a central pattern of 3's,4's,5's flanked by 5's on sides.
 * Considerations across attempts: Longest consecutive non-empty rows may over-include if there are thin border rows; bounding columns must ignore outliers. No evidence of object extraction beyond simple bounding—complex shapes (e.g., holes or blobs) aren't handled yet. Padding order (rows then columns) can cause misalignment if crop is rectangular.

import typing as tp

def is_non_empty_row(row: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    """Rule: Check if a row contains any non-zero value."""
    return any(x != 0 for x in row)
```
(This is useful for identifying potential content rows but may need refinement to detect main block vs. borders.)

```python
def find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.Tuple[int, int]:
    """Observation: Identify the longest sequence of consecutive non-empty rows in the grid."""
    # (Implementation as provided; helpful for initial row span but over-inclusive in examples.)
```
(This works for rough row detection but fails when borders create multiple sequences; could be extended to find densest block.)

```python
def find_bounding_columns(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int) -> tp.Tuple[int, int]:
    """Rule: Compute the minimum and maximum column indices with non-zero values in the main row block."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for column bounds but inherits row errors.)
```
(Good for tight horizontal cropping once rows are correct.)

```python
def crop_to_bounding_box(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Extract the subgrid from the bounding box of the main block."""
    # (Implementation as provided; core extraction tool, works if bounds are accurate.)
```
(Essential for isolating content; no issues here.)

def compute_target_size(row_span: int, col_span: int) -> int:
    """Rule: Determine the side length of the square output grid as the maximum of row and column spans."""
    # (Implementation as provided; correct for squaring.)
```
(Simple and helpful.)

```python
def pad_rows_centered(grid: tp.List[tp.List[int]], target_n: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Pad the grid with empty rows centered to reach target size N."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful but can misalign if applied before full crop.)
```
(Helpful for vertical centering.)

```python
def pad_columns_centered(grid: tp.List[tp.List[int]], target_n: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Pad the grid with empty columns centered to reach target size N."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for horizontal centering.)
```
(Helpful for horizontal centering; order with row padding matters.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on finding the longest consecutive non-empty row block, cropping to its bounding columns, and padding to a square— this correctly identifies a dense central area but over-includes border-like rows (e.g., top/bottom rows of 3's in ex1 generated but shifted/partial in expected).
 * What worked: Cropping and padding mechanics produce square outputs with preserved values; bounding columns tighten horizontal span well (e.g., reduces wide empty sides).
 * What didn't work: Row selection via longest consecutive block includes extraneous borders, leading to taller-than-needed crops (e.g., ex1 generated 13 rows with mismatched top/bottom vs. expected 13 but different positioning); padding centers incorrectly due to wrong initial crop, causing shifts (e.g., ex1 row 0 has 3's in cols 2,4 but expected has them in 3,10).
 * Ex1 differences: Generated has extra 3's in row0 col4, row2 has 8's/3's misplaced vs. expected (e.g., expected row2: 3 at col1,8 at3, etc.; unknown why but likely border inclusion); row10 in generated has 8's/3's but expected has different 8 pattern—crop too wide vertically.
 * Ex2 differences: Generated includes isolated row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] and pads to 11x11 but expected excludes/repositions it, has row1 as all zeros except 3, and different internal shifts (e.g., generated row4 has 3's at1-2 but expected row3 has 3's at3-5); seems to miss central density focus.
 * Ex3 differences: Generated crops to include alternating border rows (e.g., rows 1-2,9-10 as 4/0 patterns) but expected excludes them, focusing on inner 1/2 block (e.g., expected starts with border but crops inner 8 rows tightly); generated row7 has 1's misplaced vs. expected row6.
 * No object extraction beyond bounding—may need functions to detect/ignore thin borders or find "main blob" via connectivity/density.
 * Function `find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows` is partially helpful but broken for multi-component grids (over-inclusive); keep but refine.
 * Padding functions are helpful and correct in isolation but unhelpful when chained after bad crop.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it crops to a 13x13 square with heavy top/bottom padding (empty rows 0-2,10-12) and includes side 5's (cols 0-1,11-12) as part of the main block, but the central pattern (3's frame around 4's) seems shifted left/down compared to input density; input has 5's only on sides of rows 4,6,8 but generated embeds them fully, suggesting over-cropping horizontally/vertically without excluding borders.
 * It misses subtlety of isolating the inner 3/4 pattern (likely the "object") while perhaps treating side 5's as noise; output has symmetric padding but the embedded block is 7 rows high (3-9) vs. input's scattered rows, indicating longest-block logic grabbed too much vertically but not centered properly.
 * To handle test: Need better main-block detection (e.g., ignore side columns with uniform 5's) and tighter vertical crop to rows 3-9, padding to ~9x9 or max span, then re-pad to square—current output looks like a bloated version of the input without true extraction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to process a square grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like values for shapes or images) by identifying and extracting the "main" non-zero connected component (object), cropping to its tight bounding box, and padding it to a square while preserving the original values and structure. The challenge involves correctly defining connectivity (8-connected), selecting the right component (central and largest), handling borders/frames that might connect to or surround the main object, and ensuring the extraction matches subtle positional details without introducing artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connectivity for components (diagonal neighbors count as connected), as non-zero cells can touch diagonally to form a single object.
 * The "main" component is typically the one closest to the grid center (measured by bounding box center distance to grid center), with ties broken by size (largest area); ignore small or peripheral components like borders or noise.
 * Borders or frames (e.g., repeating patterns of 3's or 4's around the edges) often form separate components or might connect to the main object, but they should be excluded—do not include them in the extraction unless they are part of the central shape.
 * After extracting the subgrid via bounding box, pad to the smallest square that fits (side length = max(height, width of subgrid)), centering the content with zeros; padding must be symmetric where possible but can be uneven if dimensions require it.
 * Grids may have multiple distinct values (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6 for object parts, 4/1/2 for shapes), but treat all non-zero as connectable regardless of value—do not segment by value.
 * Subtle positional mismatches occur frequently: e.g., in rotations or irregular shapes, the bounding box might shift, causing rows/columns to align differently; ensure the extracted subgrid retains exact relative positions.
 * Handle empty or single-cell cases gracefully (return zero-padded grid if no component).
 * Grids are always square input (n x n), but output must also be square (possibly smaller effective size after padding).
 * Easy to miss: Components might not be fully enclosed; test for cases where the main object touches the border, requiring careful separation; also, center calculation uses floating-point bounding box midpoint, so use precise distance formula.
 * Padding centers the subgrid, so calculate top/left pads as floor((n - dim)/2), with remainder on bottom/right.
 * Visually, outputs should "zoom in" on the central irregular shape, removing outer frames, but preserving internal details like holes or protrusions (e.g., isolated 6's or 8's).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implements 8-connected DFS for components, bounding box calculation, central selection with distance tiebreaker, subgrid extraction, and centered zero-padding—these are solid building blocks and worked for basic structure but failed to isolate the main object properly.
 * What worked: Component detection accurately finds non-zero groups (e.g., in example 1, it grabs a large central blob with 8's and 6's); padding centers content without distortion; handles empty cases by returning zero grid.
 * What didn't work: In all training examples, it incorrectly includes or excludes parts of the main object due to over-merging with borders (e.g., in example 1, generated includes extra 3's on left/top as part of the component, shifting the entire shape right/down compared to expected, where top row has 3's more centered and bottom has isolated 3's in columns 6-7; differences include row 0: generated [0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]—extra 3's and misaligned; row 2: generated has 8's starting earlier; row 10: generated [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,3,0]—missing 8's in positions 2-5, extra in 9; unknown why bounding box expanded to include border 3's, perhaps partial connectivity).
 * In example 2, generated mismatches inner 3's and 4's positions (e.g., row 1: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—3 shifted right; row 3: generated [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—extra 3's in cols 1-2, missing in 8; row 4: generated has 3's in 2 and 8 vs expected 3's in 1-2; likely selected a component that merged border 5's incorrectly with inner shapes).
 * In example 3, generated treats the 4's frame as part of or adjacent to the central 1/2 component, resulting in a larger bounding box that includes the entire frame (e.g., row 0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—starts with 4 instead of 0, and pattern is shifted; row 2: generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] includes frame 4's at ends vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] which crops tighter, starting inner content earlier; row 5: generated [0,4,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,4] vs expected [4,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,4,0]—rotated or flipped feel, with 4's misplaced; unknown exact cause, but likely frame 4's form a connected ring around the center, pulling the bounding box outward).
 * Overall, the attempt overestimates the main component by including border-connected cells, leading to shifted/wider outputs; selection metric works but needs refinement to explicitly exclude border-like components (e.g., those touching edges).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and mostly correct, though the full program() integrates them poorly for border separation; do not discard, but enhance select_main_component to penalize edge-touching components.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output [[5,5],[0,0]] appears correct at first glance for a tiny 2x2 input grid (assuming input is [[5,5],[0,0]]), as the non-zero cells [5,5] in row 0 form a connected component (side-by-side, 8-connected), bounding box is row 0 col 0-1, extraction is [[5,5]], padding to 2x2 adds [0,0] below, matching exactly—no border issues here since it's small and no extraneous components.
 * However, it only "makes sense" if the puzzle rules apply uniformly; for larger cases, this simple pass doesn't demonstrate handling of the core subtlety (border exclusion), so it might coincidentally work but not generalize—watch for tests with frames around small objects, where it could wrongly include them and shift the [5,5] row.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to clean up a grid by isolating the core pattern or "object" (e.g., letters, shapes, or symbols formed by non-zero cells) while removing surrounding noise, borders, or extraneous connected elements, then cropping tightly and padding to a centered square if needed. The process emphasizes distinguishing the main blob from decorative or irregular borders that are often connected but should be excluded to match the expected clean, minimal representations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids often have outer borders (e.g., 3's in example 1, 5's in example 2, 4's in example 3) that form connected components of non-zero cells but are noise; the main pattern is typically an inner, denser, or more structured blob that may not be the absolute largest component.
 * Use 8-connectivity for components to capture diagonal connections in patterns like letters or shapes, but avoid merging borders with the core if they touch—subtlety is detecting "frame-like" structures vs. solid fills.
 * Cropping must be to the tight bounding box of the main component only, preserving internal zeros (holes or gaps) but excluding isolated noise within the crop if it's not part of the pattern.
 * Padding to square uses the max dimension, centered symmetrically, with zeros; however, if the input is already square-like, no padding occurs, but the core issue is often pre-padding cleanup.
 * Expected outputs show irregular borders adjusted (e.g., some border cells zeroed out or shifted), suggesting rules like removing single-cell protrusions, handling asymmetric noise, or prioritizing components by density/shape over size.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have internal components (e.g., holes with 0's inside non-zeros) that must stay; borders may not fully enclose (e.g., gaps in test input); values like 3,4,5,6,8 represent different "inks" but connectivity is by non-zero regardless of value.
 * All non-zero cells are treated equally for connectivity, but outputs preserve original values—don't normalize or change them.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return empty; small isolated cells are noise; multiple components require selecting the "primary" one (not always largest, as borders can be bigger).
 * Considerations across attempts: Flood fill/DFS is reliable for components but needs filtering (e.g., by size threshold, perimeter-to-area ratio for "frame" detection, or excluding components touching grid edges).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented connected components, bounding box cropping, and centered square padding, which worked for basic structure preservation and output formatting (e.g., kept internal values and zeros intact).
 * What didn't work: Relied on the largest component, which included borders/noise (e.g., full 3-border in train 1 generated vs. expected irregular/partial border with some 0's and shifted positions; similar for 5-borders in train 2 and 4-borders in train 3), leading to oversized crops that retained unwanted elements.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 3's in top/bottom rows (e.g., full row of 3's in row 1/11 vs. expected sparse 3's and 0's); internal 8's and 6's shifted or added erroneously (e.g., row 2 has 8's where expected has 0's); bottom row has misplaced 3's.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated includes border 5's bleeding into inner pattern (e.g., row 3 has 3's in cols 1-2 where expected has 0's; row 4 has extra 3's and missing 4's in positions); row 1 has 3 where expected has all 0's except end.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated rotates or includes border as part of pattern (e.g., row 0 starts with 4's alternating vs. expected starting with 0; inner 1's and 2's misplaced, like row 2 has extra 0's and 1's shifted); overall looks like border merged without exclusion.
 * Function `get_largest_component` is broken/not helpful as-is (always picks size-max, ignoring border-like components; suggest filtering by not touching edges or by shape metrics).
 * Padding functions (e.g., `calculate_vertical_padding`, `apply_padding`) are helpful and correct but underutilized since crops are too large, resulting in no/minimal padding.
 * `crop_to_bounds` preserves isolated cells within bounds (good), but since wrong component is chosen, it includes noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output matches the input grid exactly (7x7 with irregular 3/4 border and inner pattern), which does not look correct because prior training examples show the need for cleanup—likely the expected output should exclude or zero out the incomplete border (e.g., top-left 3's in rows 0-1 might be noise, inner 4 as main, with tighter crop/pad to square without edge protrusions like row 6's lone 3).
 * It makes sense as a "no-op" from the program's logic (largest component spans nearly whole grid, bounding box is full 7x7, no padding needed), but fails the puzzle's intent since borders aren't removed, leading to unclean pattern (e.g., asymmetric 0's and 3's around the central 4 and lines).
 * To handle test: Program needs border exclusion (e.g., ignore components touching all four edges) to crop just the inner cross-like pattern with 4, padding to square if height/width differ after cleanup.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:23:59] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify and extract the primary "image" or figure from a sparse grid of positive integers (likely representing colored pixels or segments of a logo/object), crop it to a tight bounding box (possibly allowing limited gaps for incomplete rows/columns), pad it to a centered square of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, and output the result as a square grid. The extraction must preserve the relative positions and values of the non-zero elements while ignoring empty borders and disconnected noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid represents a 2D image with 0s as background/empty and positive integers as filled pixels of different "colors" or types (e.g., 3,5,6,8 in train1; 3,4,5 in train2; 1,2,4 in train3), and the output must retain these exact values without alteration.
 * Cropping should focus on the densest or most continuous block of non-zeros, treating the grid as potentially containing a single main object with possible thin gaps (e.g., single empty rows/columns might be tolerated, but larger gaps separate components).
 * Padding must be even (centered) on all sides to form a square, using 0s, but the square size is max(cropped_height, cropped_width), not the original grid size—subtly, this can lead to oversized outputs if cropping is loose.
 * Disconnected components (e.g., separate blobs of the same or different numbers) should likely be ignored except for the main/largest one; the test input has multiple scattered clusters (5's in rows 6-7 and 17-19; 3's and 4 in rows 9-15), suggesting the program must select the primary figure, not union all.
 * Row/column selection prioritizes maximum "density" (e.g., sum of non-zeros or count of non-empty lines), but with gap tolerance: train1 expected allows some irregularity (e.g., partial rows at top/bottom), while generated includes extras like full empty rows.
 * Fallback bounding box logic (min-max non-zero positions) is sometimes needed if no perfect contiguous subarray exists, but it must not include large empty margins.
 * Outputs are square but sized to the cropped content (e.g., train2 expected is 10x10, not 12x12), implying tight cropping is key; loose cropping bloats the square unnecessarily.
 * Subtle asymmetry in expected outputs: train1 expected has uneven padding (e.g., more empty space on right/bottom), but generated is more symmetric yet includes unwanted elements (e.g., extra 3's in row0/col2).
 * Rotation, mirroring, or reordering is not needed—preserve original orientation and positions relative to crop.
 * Edge cases: fully disconnected grids (like test) require selecting the largest/densest component; all-zero grids should output empty square of original size? But program returns n x n zeros, which may be correct.
 * Non-zero counts per row/column are useful metrics, but "sum of values" vs. "count of non-zeros" matters—program uses count, but if values represent thickness, sum might be better (unknown, but generated mismatches suggest count is insufficient).
 * Grids can be non-square originally, but outputs are always square; n varies (13 in train1, 12 in train2/3, 20 in test).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies the need for density-based cropping using non-zero counts per row/column and gap-tolerant subarray search, which partially worked for finding approximate bounds in contiguous cases but failed due to incorrect gap tolerances (e.g., max_gap=1 for rows included extra sparse rows in train1, leading to 14x14 instead of 13x13).
 * Cropping logic for columns used max_gap=0 (strict contiguous), with fallback to min-max bounding, but this over-included sparse columns in train1 (e.g., generated has extra 0's and shifted 3's on left/right) and failed to isolate the main figure in train2/3 (generated 12x12 includes borders, expected 10x10 crops tighter).
 * Padding to max(h,w) with centered 0's is correct in principle but produced oversized/inaccurate squares because upstream cropping was loose; e.g., train1 generated includes unwanted top/bottom rows with isolated 3's, mismatching expected's tighter crop (e.g., expected row0 has isolated 3's but different positions).
 * For train1, generated mismatched blob shapes: e.g., row2 has [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,...] vs. expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why, possibly due to row selection including row1 (all 3's) but shifting columns wrong; also added extra bottom empty row.
 * For train2, generated included full empty borders (12x12) and misplaced elements (e.g., row1 [0,5,0,5,...] vs. expected starting directly with [5,0,5,...] in a 10x10 crop), failing to exclude outer empties and select the inner 3/4/5 figure tightly; fallback column logic didn't trigger properly.
 * For train3, similar issue: generated 12x12 with borders, mismatching expected 10x10 crop (e.g., generated row2 [0,0,4,0,4,...] includes extras vs. expected direct [0,4,0,4,...]); strict column gap=0 excluded valid irregular parts like scattered 1's/2's.
 * No object extraction function was present, but one could be added to find connected components (e.g., via flood-fill on non-zeros) to isolate the main blob, as density alone misses disconnected noise.
 * The max_subarray function is helpful and mostly correct but needs tunable gaps (e.g., try 0-2) and perhaps sum-of-values instead of count for density.
 * compute_row_nonzero is useful and correct, but a column version is implied and works partially.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt—all are relevant, but the overall program lacks component selection, leading to inclusion of noise.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a 20x20 grid (original size) with only a small cropped/padded region of 3's,4's,5's in the top-leftish area (rows ~6-14, cols ~7-12), but ignores lower 5's (rows 17-19) and pads excessively with zeros everywhere else, resulting in a mostly empty grid that doesn't isolate a single main figure.
 * Compared to input, it captured the middle 3/4 cluster but missed the top 5's (rows 6-7) and bottom 5's (rows 17-19), suggesting the row selection with max_gap=1 picked only one component; expected likely needs to select the largest/densest (the 3/4 block) and crop tightly to ~6x6 or so, padded to square without the full 20x20 bloat.
 * The output makes partial sense as a cropped attempt but is incorrect because it doesn't form a compact square representation of the primary content—it's diluted by huge zero padding, and the positioned content (e.g., 5's in rows 6-7 of output match input's top 5's? Wait, no—output rows 6-7 have 5's in cols 7-11, matching input row6-7, but then jumps to 3's in row9-15, indicating it unioned non-contiguous rows, which bloated h=10+ but with gaps, violating gap tolerance.
 * To handle test, must add connected component analysis to pick one main object (likely the densest 3/4 block in rows9-15, cols6-13), crop tightly (h~7, w~8, pad to 8x8), excluding scattered 5's as noise.

[2025-10-02 10:24:09] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train input/output pair (train 1, 2, and 3). I focused only on consistent effects or interactions (e.g., one property affecting another, or components influencing each other), ignoring irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., colors unique to one example like Maroon/Pink in train 1 or Blue/Red in train 3; isolated small components with no transformation; properties like specific pixel arrangements that vary). No high-level solving or total understanding is included. Unknowns (e.g., exact mechanism for some position changes) are noted explicitly. Only interactions consistent across **all** examples are listed.

#### 1. **Position (bbox) -> Inclusion/Exclusion of Component**
   - **Description**: The position (bbox coordinates) of a component interacts with the positions of other components to determine if it is included in the output. Components whose bbox is positioned "outside" the collective main structure (defined by the aggregate min/max bbox of most components) are excluded (removed entirely). Included components keep all other properties (color, holes, pixels) unchanged.
   - **Consistency Across All Examples**:
     - Train 1: Small components at extreme positions (e.g., bbox [1,16,1,17] at low x/high y; [5,18,5,18] and [9,18,10,18] at high y) are excluded. Main structure bbox starts at x=6/y=0.
     - Train 2: Small components at extreme positions (e.g., Green [1,15,1,15] at low x/high y; Yellow [4,16,4,16] at low x/high y) are excluded. Main structure bbox starts at x=6/y=2, max x=15/y=11.
     - Train 3: At least one small component at extreme position (e.g., Yellow [14,3,14,3] at high x/low y relative to main cluster) is excluded. Main structure spans x=1-10/y=2-18 but compacts, ignoring outlier.
   - **Effect**: Position of outliers affects their removal; positions of main components collectively define the "boundary" for inclusion (e.g., via aggregate min/max). Small pixel counts (p≤2) often correlate but are not sufficient alone—position is the key interactor.
   - **Unknown**: Exact definition of "main structure boundary" (e.g., how "extreme" is calculated—possibly distance from center or overlap with largest component; consistent exclusion but mechanism varies slightly).

#### 2. **Aggregate Position (group bbox) -> Individual Position Transformation (shift)**
   - **Description**: The positions (bbox min_x and min_y) of all included components interact collectively to determine a global shift applied to every included component's bbox. The shift normalizes the group to start near (0,0), affecting all x and y coordinates uniformly.
   - **Consistency Across All Examples**:
     - Train 1: Group min_x=6, min_y=0; all included bboxes shift left by 6 in x (y unchanged). E.g., Green [6,0,18,12] -> [0,0,12,12]; Pink [10,4,14,8] -> [4,4,8,8].
     - Train 2: Group min_x=6, min_y=2; all included bboxes shift left by 6 in x, up by 2 in y. E.g., Green [9,3,12,4] -> [3,1,6,2]; most Oranges follow (e.g., [6,2,6,2] -> [0,0,0,0] initially before further transform).
     - Train 3: Group min_x≈1-8, min_y≈2-3 (compacted); all included bboxes shift to start from 0-1 in x/y, filling low coordinates row-by-row. E.g., top Blue [8,2,10,2] -> [3,2,4,3]; many Yellows repositioned to y=0-1 starting at x=0-1.
   - **Effect**: Positions of multiple components affect each other via the group's aggregate min_x/min_y, which "pulls" all to top-left. This is a many-to-many interaction (one component's position influences the shift for all others).
   - **Unknown**: Exact aggregate calculation (e.g., strict min of all included, or min of largest component); consistent shift direction (left/up to 0) but magnitude ties to group, not individuals.

#### 3. **Individual Position (bbox) + Aggregate Size -> Further Position Transformation (flip/rotation-like movement)**
   - **Description**: After the global shift, the position of each component interacts with the aggregate size of the shifted group (e.g., max_x - min_x +1, same for y) to apply a consistent "reversal" or flip effect to positions, moving elements toward opposite sides/corners. This affects bbox coordinates (x/y swapped or inverted relative to group size) but preserves component separation.
   - **Consistency Across All Examples**:
     - Train 1: Group size 13x13 after shift; positions inverted relative to size-1 (e.g., small Maroon rel [2,2,3,3] -> [9,9,10,10] via 180-like reversal around center). Large components' bboxes stay similar due to symmetry.
     - Train 2: Group size 10x10 after shift; positions inverted (e.g., top-edge Oranges move to bottom edge y=9 with x reversed; vertical Greens swap positions pairwise via reversal). Yellow [4,3,6,5] rel -> [4,4,6,6] (y inverted to opposite side; x adjusted).
     - Train 3: Group compacts to ~10x10 effective size; positions reversed/filled from bottom to top (e.g., high-y Yellows in input move to low-y in output; clustered Yellows at y=17-18 -> y=0-1 with x spread; Red/Blue move to central/low positions via opposition to original high y).
   - **Effect**: Individual position affects its own movement relative to group size (e.g., low-y input -> high-y output, and vice versa; x often reversed). Group size (from all positions) affects the "pivot" for this movement, creating interaction between components (e.g., one component's extent enlarges group size, altering others' inversion distance).
   - **Unknown**: Precise mechanism (full 180 rotation vs. vertical/horizontal flip vs. reversal along axes)—consistent "opposition" movement (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right reversal) but exact math (e.g., size-1 - coord) varies slightly by shape (bbox tightens post-transform in some cases like train 2 Yellow).

#### 4. **Holes + Pixels -> Preservation (no interaction with position/color)**
   - **Description**: The holes and pixels properties of included components do not interact with or affect other properties (e.g., no change based on position or color); they are always preserved exactly for each included component.
   - **Consistency Across All Examples**:
     - Train 1: All included keep holes (e.g., Green holes=1 ->1, pixels=48->48; small Maroon holes=0, pixels=3->3).
     - Train 2: All included keep holes=0, pixels exact (e.g., Yellow pixels=6->6; Greens pixels=5->5 each).
     - Train 3: All included keep holes=0, pixels exact (e.g., Red pixels=4->4; Blues pixels=1-4 preserved; Yellows pixels=1->1).
   - **Effect**: No effect on other components—these are "static" properties unaffected by interactions. (Note: Holes=1 appears only in train 1, but preservation is consistent where present; no evidence holes affect inclusion/movement in other trains.)
   - **Unknown**: None—preservation is fully consistent, but no observed interaction with other properties (e.g., holes do not consistently trigger special movement).

#### Non-Interactions (Explicitly Irrelevant or Inconsistent, Per Instructions)
- **Color -> Any Effect**: Colors are preserved but do not consistently affect movement, inclusion, or other properties across all examples (e.g., Green preserved in 1-2 but absent in 3; no color-specific transformation like "Green causes shift").
- **Shape Properties (e.g., edges, silhouettes) -> Movement**: Not identifiable from provided data (bbox/pixels only); no consistent effect on transformation (e.g., "partial shapes" in train 2 do not uniquely interact).
- **Hole Count -> Inclusion or Transformation**: Inconsistent (triggers main structure in train 1 but all holes=0 in 2-3 with no difference).
- **Pixels -> Inclusion**: Inconsistent threshold (p=3 included in train 1; p=1 ignored in 2-3; position overrides pixels for inclusion).
- No consistent color-to-color interactions (e.g., no "Yellow affects Green position" across all).

This list captures only obvious, consistent patterns without forcing unobservable connections or solving the puzzle. If more details (e.g., full pixel grids) were provided, additional interactions might emerge, but based on given info, these are the clear ones.

[2025-10-02 10:28:13] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train input/output pair (train 1, 2, and 3). I focused only on consistent effects or interactions (e.g., one property affecting another, or components influencing each other), ignoring irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., colors unique to one example like Maroon/Pink in train 1 or Blue/Red in train 3; isolated small components with no transformation; properties like specific pixel arrangements that vary). No high-level solving or total understanding is included. Unknowns (e.g., exact mechanism for some position changes) are noted explicitly. Only interactions consistent across **all** examples are listed.

#### 1. **Position (bbox) -> Inclusion/Exclusion of Component**
   - **Description**: The position (bbox coordinates) of a component interacts with the positions of other components to determine if it is included in the output. Components whose bbox is positioned "outside" the collective main structure (defined by the aggregate min/max bbox of most components) are excluded (removed entirely). Included components keep all other properties (color, holes, pixels) unchanged.
   - **Consistency Across All Examples**:
     - Train 1: Small components at extreme positions (e.g., bbox [1,16,1,17] at low x/high y; [5,18,5,18] and [9,18,10,18] at high y) are excluded. Main structure bbox starts at x=6/y=0.
     - Train 2: Small components at extreme positions (e.g., Green [1,15,1,15] at low x/high y; Yellow [4,16,4,16] at low x/high y) are excluded. Main structure bbox starts at x=6/y=2, max x=15/y=11.
     - Train 3: At least one small component at extreme position (e.g., Yellow [14,3,14,3] at high x/low y relative to main cluster) is excluded. Main structure spans x=1-10/y=2-18 but compacts, ignoring outlier.
   - **Effect**: Position of outliers affects their removal; positions of main components collectively define the "boundary" for inclusion (e.g., via aggregate min/max). Small pixel counts (p≤2) often correlate but are not sufficient alone—position is the key interactor.
   - **Unknown**: Exact definition of "main structure boundary" (e.g., how "extreme" is calculated—possibly distance from center or overlap with largest component; consistent exclusion but mechanism varies slightly).

#### 2. **Aggregate Position (group bbox) -> Individual Position Transformation (shift)**
   - **Description**: The positions (bbox min_x and min_y) of all included components interact collectively to determine a global shift applied to every included component's bbox. The shift normalizes the group to start near (0,0), affecting all x and y coordinates uniformly.
   - **Consistency Across All Examples**:
     - Train 1: Group min_x=6, min_y=0; all included bboxes shift left by 6 in x (y unchanged). E.g., Green [6,0,18,12] -> [0,0,12,12]; Pink [10,4,14,8] -> [4,4,8,8].
     - Train 2: Group min_x=6, min_y=2; all included bboxes shift left by 6 in x, up by 2 in y. E.g., Green [9,3,12,4] -> [3,1,6,2]; most Oranges follow (e.g., [6,2,6,2] -> [0,0,0,0] initially before further transform).
     - Train 3: Group min_x≈1-8, min_y≈2-3 (compacted); all included bboxes shift to start from 0-1 in x/y, filling low coordinates row-by-row. E.g., top Blue [8,2,10,2] -> [3,2,4,3]; many Yellows repositioned to y=0-1 starting at x=0-1.
   - **Effect**: Positions of multiple components affect each other via the group's aggregate min_x/min_y, which "pulls" all to top-left. This is a many-to-many interaction (one component's position influences the shift for all others).
   - **Unknown**: Exact aggregate calculation (e.g., strict min of all included, or min of largest component); consistent shift direction (left/up to 0) but magnitude ties to group, not individuals.

#### 3. **Individual Position (bbox) + Aggregate Size -> Further Position Transformation (flip/rotation-like movement)**
   - **Description**: After the global shift, the position of each component interacts with the aggregate size of the shifted group (e.g., max_x - min_x +1, same for y) to apply a consistent "reversal" or flip effect to positions, moving elements toward opposite sides/corners. This affects bbox coordinates (x/y swapped or inverted relative to group size) but preserves component separation.
   - **Consistency Across All Examples**:
     - Train 1: Group size 13x13 after shift; positions inverted relative to size-1 (e.g., small Maroon rel [2,2,3,3] -> [9,9,10,10] via 180-like reversal around center). Large components' bboxes stay similar due to symmetry.
     - Train 2: Group size 10x10 after shift; positions inverted (e.g., top-edge Oranges move to bottom edge y=9 with x reversed; vertical Greens swap positions pairwise via reversal). Yellow [4,3,6,5] rel -> [4,4,6,6] (y inverted to opposite side; x adjusted).
     - Train 3: Group compacts to ~10x10 effective size; positions reversed/filled from bottom to top (e.g., high-y Yellows in input move to low-y in output; clustered Yellows at y=17-18 -> y=0-1 with x spread; Red/Blue move to central/low positions via opposition to original high y).
   - **Effect**: Individual position affects its own movement relative to group size (e.g., low-y input -> high-y output, and vice versa; x often reversed). Group size (from all positions) affects the "pivot" for this movement, creating interaction between components (e.g., one component's extent enlarges group size, altering others' inversion distance).
   - **Unknown**: Precise mechanism (full 180 rotation vs. vertical/horizontal flip vs. reversal along axes)—consistent "opposition" movement (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right reversal) but exact math (e.g., size-1 - coord) varies slightly by shape (bbox tightens post-transform in some cases like train 2 Yellow).

#### 4. **Holes + Pixels -> Preservation (no interaction with position/color)**
   - **Description**: The holes and pixels properties of included components do not interact with or affect other properties (e.g., no change based on position or color); they are always preserved exactly for each included component.
   - **Consistency Across All Examples**:
     - Train 1: All included keep holes (e.g., Green holes=1 ->1, pixels=48->48; small Maroon holes=0, pixels=3->3).
     - Train 2: All included keep holes=0, pixels exact (e.g., Yellow pixels=6->6; Greens pixels=5->5 each).
     - Train 3: All included keep holes=0, pixels exact (e.g., Red pixels=4->4; Blues pixels=1-4 preserved; Yellows pixels=1->1).
   - **Effect**: No effect on other components—these are "static" properties unaffected by interactions. (Note: Holes=1 appears only in train 1, but preservation is consistent where present; no evidence holes affect inclusion/movement in other trains.)
   - **Unknown**: None—preservation is fully consistent, but no observed interaction with other properties (e.g., holes do not consistently trigger special movement).

#### Non-Interactions (Explicitly Irrelevant or Inconsistent, Per Instructions)
- **Color -> Any Effect**: Colors are preserved but do not consistently affect movement, inclusion, or other properties across all examples (e.g., Green preserved in 1-2 but absent in 3; no color-specific transformation like "Green causes shift").
- **Shape Properties (e.g., edges, silhouettes) -> Movement**: Not identifiable from provided data (bbox/pixels only); no consistent effect on transformation (e.g., "partial shapes" in train 2 do not uniquely interact).
- **Hole Count -> Inclusion or Transformation**: Inconsistent (triggers main structure in train 1 but all holes=0 in 2-3 with no difference).
- **Pixels -> Inclusion**: Inconsistent threshold (p=3 included in train 1; p=1 ignored in 2-3; position overrides pixels for inclusion).
- No consistent color-to-color interactions (e.g., no "Yellow affects Green position" across all).

This list captures only obvious, consistent patterns without forcing unobservable connections or solving the puzzle. If more details (e.g., full pixel grids) were provided, additional interactions might emerge, but based on given info, these are the clear ones.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:38:44] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored pixels (represented by integers like 3, 5, 6, 8) where the task is to identify and extract the "main" object—likely a composite shape formed by nearby connected components of the same or different colors—then rotate it to a canonical orientation (e.g., upright) based on color cues, and output the rotated grid with the object centered or aligned in a minimal bounding box, omitting extraneous pixels or noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent pixels of the exact same color; different colors do not connect directly, but "meta-components" group nearby components (via centroid distance) to form composite objects.
 * The "main" object is the largest meta-component by total pixel count, ignoring smaller isolated blobs or noise (e.g., stray pixels or small groups).
 * Rotation is determined by specific "cue" colors in the main object: presence of 5 triggers clockwise (cw) rotation, 1 triggers counterclockwise (ccw), otherwise default to 180-degree rotation; this seems to "unrotate" the object based on asymmetric markers.
 * After extraction, pixels are shifted relative to the aggregate bounding box (bbox) minimums, rotated in the new orientation (which may swap height/width for 90-degree rotations), and placed in a new grid of the rotated dimensions; zeros fill the rest, but the output should match the expected shape, size, and positioning exactly.
 * Subtleties include: threshold for meta-grouping (e.g., 5.5 units via Euclidean distance on centroids) must be tuned to capture intended composites without merging unrelated parts; bbox computation uses min/max rows/columns across grouped components; rotations must handle coordinate transformations precisely (e.g., cw: new_row = old_col, new_col = new_width-1 - old_row_offset) to avoid off-by-one errors or flipped placements.
 * Outputs are lists of lists (rows), with exact dimensions and pixel placements matching expectations; extraneous rows/columns of zeros or misaligned shapes indicate failure.
 * Noise omission is key—small components (e.g., single pixels or tiny blobs) should be ignored unless part of the main meta-group.
 * Color sets drive decisions but only for rotation; all colors in the main group are preserved post-rotation.
 * Edge cases: rotated grids may change aspect ratio (h↔w for cw/ccw); 180-degree keeps dimensions but inverts positions; if no main object, return minimal empty grid.
 * Potential pitfalls: centroid approximation via bbox center may inaccurately group if shapes are irregular; stack-based flood fill must mark visited correctly to avoid infinite loops or missed pixels.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies connected components and meta-grouping via proximity, which works well for composite objects (as seen in training example 3 passing).
 * Rotation detection via color cues (5 for cw, 1 for ccw, else 180) is a core principle that aligns with puzzle asymmetry, but fails when cues are absent or misdetected (e.g., training 1 defaults to 180 but placements are off).
 * Extraction of largest meta-component by pixel count effectively omits noise in cases like training 3, but in training 1, it includes too much or misaligns the bbox, leading to partial shape matches.
 * Threshold of 5.5 for meta-grouping works for some densities (training 3) but may be too loose/tight for others, causing over-merging or under-grouping (e.g., training 2 scatters pixels instead of compacting).
 * Centroid-based bbox centers approximate well for symmetric blobs but may err on irregular shapes, contributing to incorrect distances in training 1 and 2.
 * Pixel extraction and rotation application preserve colors and positions mostly correctly, but coordinate transforms have off-by-one or inversion issues (e.g., training 1 generated first row [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]—3's shifted right; last row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—misplaced and wrong count).
 * In training 2, generated a sparse 15x15-ish grid with isolated pixels (e.g., row 0: [0,3,0,0,...]; row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]) vs compact 10x10 expected (e.g., row 0: [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5])—failed to group/rotate into dense shape, possibly due to poor meta-detection or wrong rotation (colors include 5, so cw attempted but dimensions wrong: generated tall/thin vs expected square-ish).
 * Training 1 mismatches blob shapes in rows 0,1,6,12 (unknown reason—possibly bbox shift or rotation not inverting fully; 3's and 6's positions swapped or flipped incorrectly).
 * Training 2 omits consolidation, leaving unrotated fragments (e.g., 5's and 3's not aligned into expected borders).
 * The main program orchestrates well but bbox computation and rotation placement need tighter offset handling (e.g., no padding added; exact min_r/min_c subtraction).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all provided are relevant, though rotation may need validation for edge cases like zero-height/width.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x10 grid with vertical 5's on the left (rows 1-2,4-9), horizontal 3's in the middle forming a shape with a 4 inset (row 6 col 6), and bottom 3's— it looks like a partial frame or letter-like shape, but density feels low (many zeros) and asymmetric, suggesting incomplete grouping or wrong rotation.
 * It does not look fully correct: the 5's form a sparse column, 3's a loose blob with 4 inside, but if the puzzle expects a rotated/aligned compact object (e.g., cw since 5 present), this may be pre-rotation or mis-extracted; expected likely denser (like training 2's compact form) with 5's repositioned to borders, 4 centered, and no stray zeros in a minimal bbox.
 * Differences from intuition: positions like 4 at (6,6) seem arbitrary; if cw rotation was applied, 5's should map horizontally—current verticality suggests either no rotation triggered or transform failed; overall, it resembles unprocessed input more than a "solved" upright object, missing the consolidation seen in correct training 3.

[2025-10-02 10:38:52] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of only the obvious and consistent interactions/connections between properties or components. These are limited to those present in **every** train input/output pair (i.e., consistent across all three puzzles). I focused on properties like color, holes, pixels, and bbox that show direct, repeatable effects or preservations. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated small components without transformation ties) are excluded. Non-consistent elements (e.g., removal of bottom detached items occurs in trains 1 and 2 but not 3, so omitted) are not included. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained (e.g., exact bbox math), it is noted as unknown rather than speculated.

- **Color → Component Identity**: The color of each component is preserved directly from input to output, linking the same colored elements across pairs. This interaction ensures components retain their identity (e.g., Green elements in input map to Green in output in all trains; similarly for Maroon/Pink in train 1, Orange/Green/Yellow in train 2, Blue/Yellow/Red in train 3). No color changes or cross-color effects observed consistently.

- **Pixels → Component Size Preservation**: The pixel count of each corresponding component is unchanged from input to output, indicating a direct preservation effect tied to the component's "mass" or filled area. This holds for all listed components in every train (e.g., Green with 48 pixels in train 1 input/output; Yellow with 6 pixels in train 2; multiple Yellow with 1 pixel each in train 3).

- **Holes → Component Topology Preservation**: The number of holes in each corresponding component is preserved from input to output, maintaining topological properties like internal voids. This is consistent for components that have holes >0 (e.g., Green/Pink/Maroon with holes=1 in train 1; all holes=0 in trains 2 and 3, with no changes).

- **Bbox Position → Bbox Position (Translation Effect)**: The bbox coordinates of main components are transformed via a position-based shift that consistently reduces min_x and min_y values toward 0 in outputs, while preserving relative widths and heights. This interaction affects movement/positioning of the overall structure (e.g., large Green bbox min_x shifts from 6→0 in train 1, from ~6→0 in train 2, from ~1→0 in train 3; similar for min_y). Max_x and max_y adjust accordingly to fit a tighter top-left alignment. Specific shift amounts vary (unknown exact formula, but consistently translation-like based on global min of main structure). Width (max_x - min_x) and height (max_y - min_y) remain unchanged for each component.

- **Component Structure → Bbox Adjustment**: Connected multi-component structures (e.g., clusters of same/different colors forming a "main" assembly) interact such that their collective positions influence individual bbox transformations. This is evident in all trains where grouped elements (e.g., overlapping or adjacent Green/Orange/Yellow in train 2; Yellow/Blue/Red grid-like in train 3) shift together to a normalized top-left position, without splitting or merging colors. Isolated main components follow the same shift rule.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., holes affecting color, pixels affecting position, or color-based transformations) were identifiable across all three trains. Some bboxes show minor offsets (e.g., Yellow in train 2), but these are not repeatable in every example, so excluded.

[2025-10-02 10:42:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of only the obvious and consistent interactions/connections between properties or components. These are limited to those present in **every** train input/output pair (i.e., consistent across all three puzzles). I focused on properties like color, holes, pixels, and bbox that show direct, repeatable effects or preservations. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated small components without transformation ties) are excluded. Non-consistent elements (e.g., removal of bottom detached items occurs in trains 1 and 2 but not 3, so omitted) are not included. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained (e.g., exact bbox math), it is noted as unknown rather than speculated.

- **Color → Component Identity**: The color of each component is preserved directly from input to output, linking the same colored elements across pairs. This interaction ensures components retain their identity (e.g., Green elements in input map to Green in output in all trains; similarly for Maroon/Pink in train 1, Orange/Green/Yellow in train 2, Blue/Yellow/Red in train 3). No color changes or cross-color effects observed consistently.

- **Pixels → Component Size Preservation**: The pixel count of each corresponding component is unchanged from input to output, indicating a direct preservation effect tied to the component's "mass" or filled area. This holds for all listed components in every train (e.g., Green with 48 pixels in train 1 input/output; Yellow with 6 pixels in train 2; multiple Yellow with 1 pixel each in train 3).

- **Holes → Component Topology Preservation**: The number of holes in each corresponding component is preserved from input to output, maintaining topological properties like internal voids. This is consistent for components that have holes >0 (e.g., Green/Pink/Maroon with holes=1 in train 1; all holes=0 in trains 2 and 3, with no changes).

- **Bbox Position → Bbox Position (Translation Effect)**: The bbox coordinates of main components are transformed via a position-based shift that consistently reduces min_x and min_y values toward 0 in outputs, while preserving relative widths and heights. This interaction affects movement/positioning of the overall structure (e.g., large Green bbox min_x shifts from 6→0 in train 1, from ~6→0 in train 2, from ~1→0 in train 3; similar for min_y). Max_x and max_y adjust accordingly to fit a tighter top-left alignment. Specific shift amounts vary (unknown exact formula, but consistently translation-like based on global min of main structure). Width (max_x - min_x) and height (max_y - min_y) remain unchanged for each component.

- **Component Structure → Bbox Adjustment**: Connected multi-component structures (e.g., clusters of same/different colors forming a "main" assembly) interact such that their collective positions influence individual bbox transformations. This is evident in all trains where grouped elements (e.g., overlapping or adjacent Green/Orange/Yellow in train 2; Yellow/Blue/Red grid-like in train 3) shift together to a normalized top-left position, without splitting or merging colors. Isolated main components follow the same shift rule.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., holes affecting color, pixels affecting position, or color-based transformations) were identifiable across all three trains. Some bboxes show minor offsets (e.g., Yellow in train 2), but these are not repeatable in every example, so excluded.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:56:19] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely pixel art or figure extraction) where the task is to identify, isolate, and normalize the primary "object" or figure from a larger scene, typically by extracting a connected region of non-zero cells, cropping to its bounding box, resizing/padding to a square grid, and possibly applying transformations like rotation or alignment to match a canonical orientation. The output must exactly replicate specific expected layouts, which appear to emphasize precise positioning, exclusion of background or border elements, and correct handling of multiple components or numbers (e.g., 3 as borders, 6/8 as inner shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use numbers (e.g., 3 for borders/frames, 6/8/4/1/2 for object parts) to represent distinct visual elements; zeros are empty space, and connectivity defines "objects," but 8-connectivity (diagonals) may over-connect borders or backgrounds, leading to inclusion of unwanted areas.
 * The "main" object is often the largest connected component of non-zeros, but it must exclude persistent borders/frames (e.g., 3's or 4's that form enclosures) and focus on inner irregular shapes; subtle: borders may be connected but should be omitted or treated separately to avoid bloating the bounding box.
 * Cropping uses the tight bounding box (min/max row/col), then pads to the max side length square with zeros, but placement must be top-left aligned in the new grid—however, expected outputs show shifts, rotations (e.g., 90-degree turns), or flips to "upright" the figure, suggesting orientation normalization based on asymmetry (e.g., making protrusions point down or centering).
 * Padding and alignment are critical: new grid is square, but expected may have uneven padding (e.g., more zeros on top/bottom) to match visual centering or specific offsets; easy to miss that the entire output must be exactly the expected size and positions, not just the shape.
 * Multiple components exist (e.g., inner blobs of different numbers like 6 and 8 may be separate but part of one "object" if visually cohesive); the code merges them if connected, but expected sometimes separates or reorients independently.
 * Subtle elements: In enclosed scenes (e.g., train1/3), the main object is inside a frame—code includes frame if connected; rotation/flip is needed if input is sideways (e.g., train3 generated vs. expected shows row/col swap like a transpose or 90-degree clockwise rotation). Handle varying grid sizes (10x13, 10x10, 7x7) by outputting square but preserving relative positions. Non-zero cells must retain exact values; zeros must match precisely, including sparse placements.
 * Across attempts: No input grids provided, so infer from outputs—expected often has "cleaner" or reoriented inner shapes with borders detached; test case likely a simple shape (e.g., cross or letter-like with 3's) that needs similar extraction/rotation. Avoid over-cropping (losing protrusions) or under-padding (mismatched sizes).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], positions: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    # This function correctly identifies 8-connected components of non-zero cells using DFS/stack, marking visited to avoid overlaps.
    # Helpful for extracting potential objects, but may need adaptation to 4-connectivity (no diagonals) to separate borders/inner parts.
    # Returns list of components as (r, c, val) tuples; can filter by size or value (e.g., ignore components that are pure borders like all 3's).
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    for start_r, start_c, start_val in positions:
        if visited[start_r][start_c]:
            continue
        component = []
        stack = [(start_r, start_c, start_val)]
        visited[start_r][start_c] = True
        while stack:
            cr, cc, cval = stack.pop()
            component.append((cr, cc, cval))
            # 8 directions (includes diagonals—potential issue for over-connection)
            for dr, dc in [(-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,-1), (0,1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1)]:
                nr = cr + dr
                nc = cc + dc
                if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] != 0:
                    visited[nr][nc] = True
                    stack.append((nr, nc, g[nr][nc]))
        if component:
            components.append(component)
    return components
```

```python
# The main program function is partially helpful: it extracts positions, finds components, selects largest, crops to bounding box, and pads to square.
# Useful skeleton, but broken in component selection (includes borders) and lacks rotation/centering; keep for bounding box logic.
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    positions = [(r, c, g[r][c]) for r in range(len(g)) for c in range(len(g[0])) if g[r][c] != 0]
    components = find_connected_components(g, positions)
    main_component = max(components, key=len)  # Assumes largest is main—may be wrong if border is largest
    min_r = min(r for r, _, _ in main_component)
    max_r = max(r for r, _, _ in main_component)
    min_c = min(c for _, c, _ in main_component)
    max_c = max(c for _, c, _ in main_component)
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    side = max(h, w)
    new_grid = [[0] * side for _ in range(side)]
    for r, c, val in main_component:
        new_r = r - min_r
        new_c = c - min_c
        new_grid[new_r][new_c] = val
    return new_grid
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it correctly identifies non-zero positions and uses connected components to extract regions, which works for isolating potential objects but fails on all trainings due to including connected borders/frames as part of the main component (e.g., train1/3 bloat the shape with 3's/4's).
 * What worked: Bounding box cropping and square padding logic produces a normalized size/output; component extraction via stack/visited avoids revisits and handles sparse grids well.
 * What didn't work: 8-connectivity merges inner objects with enclosing borders (e.g., train1 generated includes extra 3's in rows 1/3/13 vs. expected's sparser top/bottom; train3 generated has border rows swapped vs. expected, suggesting no rotation applied); largest component assumption fails when borders are biggest (e.g., train2 generated crops to 10x10 but misplaces 5's/3's/4's, losing some zeros and connections).
 * Train1: Generated has denser 3's/8's/6's with incorrect top row [0,0,3,0,3,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,...] (extra 3's, wrong offsets); bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs. expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (misaligned protrusions); inner rows like row3 [3,3,8,8,0,...] vs. [0,3,0,8,0,...] show over-connected 3's/8's, possibly from diagonal links.
 * Train2: Generated starts with [0,0,5,0,5,5,...] but expected [5,0,5,0,5,5,...] (missing leading 5's, wrong alignment); row4 [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...] (extra 3's, 4's shifted); overall shape is cropped but rotated/misplaced, e.g., 5's frame not fully enclosed as in expected.
 * Train3: Generated border alternates starting with 4 in col0 row0 vs. expected starting with 0 (appears as 90-degree rotation or transpose needed); inner [4,0,0,0,0,1,...] vs. [0,4,0,1,1,...] shows slight shifts in 1's/2's positions, likely from including full connected 4's border.
 * find_connected_components is helpful but broken for this puzzle due to 8-connectivity (try 4-connectivity: only [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)] to detach diagonals); positions extraction is solid and reusable.
 * No other functions provided; the main program is relevant but incomplete (add rotation, e.g., check orientations and rotate grid 90/180/270 degrees to match expected asymmetry).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it appears to be a tight crop of a 3's-only shape (forming a sort of "E" or asymmetric cross in 7x7) with top-left alignment and bottom protrusion [0,0,0,0,3,0,0], but without input grid, it likely includes unwanted connected elements or fails orientation like in trainings (e.g., if input has a rotated figure or border, this misses rotation/centering, leading to mismatched positions). It makes sense as a cropped connected component of 3's but not as the full puzzle solution, since trainings show expected outputs require detaching inners, adding sparse zeros, or reorienting—here, the dense 3's block and uneven padding (e.g., row7 has isolated 3's) probably doesn't match an "upright" canonical form, and size (7x7) assumes max side without verification against expected subtlety like frame exclusion.

[2025-10-02 10:56:26] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 11:00:10] Response:
- Color preservation: Components retain their color from input to output for all corresponding elements across every puzzle.
- Holes preservation: The number of holes in a component is unchanged from input to output for matching components (identified by color and pixels) in every puzzle.
- Pixel count preservation: The number of pixels in a component remains the same from input to output for matching components (identified by color and holes) in every puzzle.
- Position transformation (bbox): Bounding boxes of components are repositioned in the output, with a consistent trend of reducing minimum x and y coordinates toward 0 across all puzzles, indicating a global spatial adjustment affecting multiple components simultaneously; exact mapping (e.g., translation, rotation) is unknown.
- Omission of peripheral small components: Components with low pixel counts (1-2 pixels), holes=0, and high y-coordinates (near the bottom of the canvas, e.g., y>=15) are consistently omitted from input to output in every puzzle, suggesting position-based filtering of detached elements.
- No merging or creation: No new components appear in outputs, and no existing components combine (pixel counts do not sum), consistent across all puzzles; interactions do not alter component identity.
- Spatial interaction among main components: Components with higher pixel counts (>3) or holes=1 interact via coordinated bbox shifts to align the overall structure toward the top-left, observed in every puzzle; specific mechanism (e.g., relative positioning) is unknown.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 11:00:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- Color preservation: Components retain their color from input to output for all corresponding elements across every puzzle.
- Holes preservation: The number of holes in a component is unchanged from input to output for matching components (identified by color and pixels) in every puzzle.
- Pixel count preservation: The number of pixels in a component remains the same from input to output for matching components (identified by color and holes) in every puzzle.
- Position transformation (bbox): Bounding boxes of components are repositioned in the output, with a consistent trend of reducing minimum x and y coordinates toward 0 across all puzzles, indicating a global spatial adjustment affecting multiple components simultaneously; exact mapping (e.g., translation, rotation) is unknown.
- Omission of peripheral small components: Components with low pixel counts (1-2 pixels), holes=0, and high y-coordinates (near the bottom of the canvas, e.g., y>=15) are consistently omitted from input to output in every puzzle, suggesting position-based filtering of detached elements.
- No merging or creation: No new components appear in outputs, and no existing components combine (pixel counts do not sum), consistent across all puzzles; interactions do not alter component identity.
- Spatial interaction among main components: Components with higher pixel counts (>3) or holes=1 interact via coordinated bbox shifts to align the overall structure toward the top-left, observed in every puzzle; specific mechanism (e.g., relative positioning) is unknown.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 11:14:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean up a colored grid (likely representing a segmented image or diagram) by identifying and removing small or peripheral connected components (blobs of the same integer value), then trimming empty borders to create a minimal bounding box, and finally padding to a square shape while preserving the core structure of larger components. The expected outputs suggest a focus on retaining main "objects" or "shapes" (e.g., letters, symbols, or diagrams formed by colored regions) while eliminating noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts, especially those in peripheral or high-row positions, to match a compact, cleaned representation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right) and defined by matching integer values (colors like 3,5,6,8); size is counted by number of cells, and small ones (size <=2) should be omitted only if they are "peripheral" – specifically, those with minimum row index >=15 (assuming row 0 is top, so "high y" means lower rows? Wait, code uses min_r_comp >=15, but examples suggest top rows are low indices; this may be inverted or grid-specific).
 * Omission/resetting: After identifying a small component, reflood it with 0s using the original grid to avoid visited array issues, but ensure it doesn't accidentally affect larger components of the same color.
 * Trimming: Extract the minimal bounding box of non-zero cells post-omission; if no non-zeros remain, return empty; subtleties include handling uneven shapes (e.g., examples show irregular blobs like letters 'E' or 'F' in colors).
 * Padding: Add zero rows/columns only on right and bottom to reach max(h,w) side length; preserve top-left alignment.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have "noise" like isolated 1-2 cell blobs in borders or specific rows (e.g., example 1 has stray 3's in top/bottom rows to remove); colors represent distinct objects (don't merge across colors); no holes mentioned, but examples have enclosed areas (e.g., 6's might form loops); row indexing matters – example 1 expected removes top-left 3's but keeps some bottom ones, suggesting peripheral means outer edges or specific row thresholds; example 3 shows heavy trimming needed from a sparse 15x15 to 10x10, implying removal of all but central multi-color structure; test input has vertical stacks of 5's/3's separated by empty rows, suggesting need to remove isolated small groups and connect or preserve main horizontal structures.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connections; handle empty grids gracefully; post-trim grid may not be square initially, but padding ensures it; potential over-removal (e.g., keeping size=3+ even if peripheral); row threshold >=15 seems arbitrary/misapplied (example 1 has rows up to 12, so maybe threshold is wrong or rows are bottom-up).
 * Other considerations: Examples suggest puzzle is about "object extraction" from noisy scans (e.g., OCR-like cleanup); test input has long empty rows/columns, so trimming must be aggressive; colors like 4/6 may form "filled" shapes, while 3/5/8 are outlines; don't assume square input – outputs vary (13x13, 10x10, 10x10).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt shown, composing omission, trim, and pad; it partially understands component detection and cleanup but fails all trainings due to incomplete removal (e.g., keeps some small 3's in ex1 top row [positions 2 and 4 in gen vs expected only at 3 and 10]; ex1 row2 starts with [3,3,...] vs expected [0,3,...], suggesting didn't remove left-peripheral size=2 blob; ex1 bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] – partial removal but wrong positions).
 * Ex2: Generated keeps extra 3's in row3 [0,3,3,0,...] vs expected [0,0,3,0,...]; row4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0] – mismatches in 3/4 placement, likely didn't remove small isolated 3's or mis-trimmed; overall shape is close but blob connectivity wrong (e.g., 4's not fully filled).
 * Ex3: Generated retains full 15x15 with sparse top/bottom (e.g., isolated 1's/4's at edges) vs expected compact 10x10 central structure; omission didn't trigger (components larger? or threshold >=15 skips all since grid is 15 rows, min_r=0 <15); trim/pad ineffective as bounding box includes empties.
 * Function `omit_peripheral_small_components` is helpful but broken: row threshold too high (skips removals in small grids); reset uses original g but may miss if visited interferes; doesn't handle "peripheral" as edge-distance (e.g., cols 0 or rows 0/last).
 * `trim_empty_borders` is helpful and correct in logic but fails if upstream has unremoved noise expanding bounds.
 * `pad_to_square` is helpful and correct but irrelevant if prior steps wrong.
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., no function to list all components by size/color/min-max bounds); attempt misses that some "small" might be size>2 if peripheral, or need to remove based on position not just size/row.
 * General: No handling of multi-color interactions (e.g., ex1 has 3 as background/outline?); attempt assumes no holes but ex1/2 have potential enclosed 0's in 6/4.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a sparse 19x19 grid retaining isolated small stacks (e.g., vertical 5's in cols 3-4 rows 0-4, horizontal 5's in rows 7-8 cols 11-15, 3's in row10 cols11-12 and row15 col13) without removal, and long empty rows/columns (e.g., rows 5-6,9,16-18 all zero), suggesting omission didn't trigger (components size=3+? or threshold issue) and trim failed to crop to central multi-color structure around rows10-15 cols10-18 (3's/4's/5's forming shapes); expected should be a trimmed square (likely ~8x10 or similar) with main blobs (e.g., 3's as bars, 5's as borders, 4 as filler) compacted, removing top isolated 5's/3's and bottom strays; this looks like no effective cleanup, preserving noise.

[2025-10-02 11:14:18] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Properties

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions, connections, or property relationships between components (or their properties) that appear in **every** puzzle. These are limited to patterns that hold across all examples without exception. I focused only on elements with clear, direct interactions (e.g., one property influencing another's transformation or preservation) that are consistent and not forced. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., non-interacting single pixels with no positional ties to others) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or provided. Where a full explanation of a transformation cannot be determined from the data (e.g., exact mapping rule), it is noted as unknown rather than speculated.

- **Color preservation across corresponding components**: Every component in the output matches the color of a specific input component (e.g., Green to Green, Pink to Pink, Maroon to Maroon, Orange to Orange, Yellow to Yellow, Blue to Blue, Red to Red). No color changes or cross-color merges occur. This indicates color as a fixed identifier linking input components to their output counterparts, unaffected by position or other properties.

- **Pixel count preservation for corresponding components**: Each output component has the exact same pixel count as its input counterpart (e.g., 48 for Green, 12 for Pink, 37 for large Maroon, 3 for small Maroon in train 1; 5 for each Green, 6 for Yellow, various 1-4 for Orange/Blue/Red in trains 2/3). Pixel count acts as a unique identifier tying components across input/output, showing that the internal "mass" of a component is conserved regardless of positional changes. This holds for all included components, with no splitting or combining.

- **Holes count preservation for corresponding components**: The number of holes (0 or 1) remains identical for each matched component (e.g., holes=1 for Green/Pink/large Maroon in train 1; holes=0 for all in trains 2/3). Holes interact with the component's structure (possibly indicating internal voids relative to the shape's silhouette), and this property is invariant under the transformation, suggesting holes are intrinsic to the component and not affected by external factors like position or color.

- **Global positional transformation applied to all included components' bboxes**: The bounding boxes (bbox) of all corresponding components undergo a consistent unknown transformation (likely a rigid whole-image operation like rotation, reflection, or normalization, as relative positions shift predictably but not via simple translation). For example:
  - In every case, output bboxes start from low coordinates (e.g., near [0,0] for main structures), indicating a normalization interaction where the "main" area's position influences all others (e.g., main container/frame bbox in train 1 shifts to [0,0,12,12], pulling inner components like Pink/Maroon along; similar top-left anchoring in trains 2/3 for Orange/Green/Yellow/Blue clusters).
  - Relative positioning is preserved in a transformed way: Components that overlap or are nested in input (e.g., Pink inside Maroon inside Green in train 1; Yellow inside/combined with Green in train 2; Red/Blue amid Yellows in train 3) maintain nesting or adjacency post-transformation, but with altered orientations (e.g., vertical bars become horizontal or vice versa). The exact mapping (e.g., 90-degree rotation relative to a frame) is unknown from the data alone.
  - This transformation links all positions interdependently—no component's bbox changes in isolation; all shift cohesively relative to the overall structure.

- **Inclusion/exclusion based on positional interaction with main structure**: Components interact via position with a "main structure" (e.g., the Green frame in train 1, the assembled Green/Orange bars in train 2, the central Yellow/Blue/Red cluster in train 3). Only components whose bbox overlaps or is adjacent to the main structure's bbox are included in the output and transformed; isolated small components (pixels ≤2, holes=0, no bbox overlap with main) positioned as outliers (e.g., high y-values beyond main area in trains 1/2, or extreme x-values in train 3) are consistently omitted. This shows position as a gatekeeper property: outlier status (distance from main bbox) determines interaction with the transformation process, affecting inclusion. Omitted components have no further connections.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-position effects like "Green always causes shift in Orange," as colors vary per puzzle; no consistent hole-to-color or shape-specific transformations beyond preservation; no edge/silhouette effects on movement, as silhouettes aren't detailed enough in the data). Components without these ties (e.g., purely standalone with no positional/structural link) are irrelevant and excluded.

[2025-10-02 11:18:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to automatically detect, crop, and pad the central "object" or pattern (a connected or dense region of non-zero values representing shapes like numbers or symbols) to produce a tight, square bounding box output, removing empty borders while preserving the relative structure and values of the pattern. The input grids are larger (e.g., 20x20) with sparse non-zero elements forming the puzzle elements, and the output should be a smaller square grid (size determined by the bounding box) with zero-padding if needed to square it.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main pattern is a contiguous or near-contiguous blob of non-zero cells (e.g., digits like 3,8,6 representing filled pixels), often vertically or horizontally elongated, surrounded by large empty (zero) borders; cropping must tightly bound this blob without including irrelevant empty space or extraneous small features.
 * Row_nonzero counts (number of positive cells per row) are key for identifying dense rows, but the max subarray must handle cases where the blob isn't perfectly contiguous—subtle gaps (e.g., single zero rows/columns within the blob) should not split it if they are minimal.
 * Column bounding (min_c, max_c) must be recomputed after row trimming to avoid including outlier columns from trimmed rows; width/height calculation affects square sizing, where size = max(height, width), and padding is symmetric (//2 flooring).
 * Trimming logic for excess height (when height > width) should prioritize removing rows with fewer non-zeros, but avoid over-trimming if it cuts into the core pattern; additional checks for rows with <2 non-zeros help remove thin borders but can erroneously trim meaningful sparse rows in the pattern.
 * Patterns may have internal zeros (e.g., holes in '8's), so non-zero density alone isn't perfect—consider connectivity (e.g., flood fill for blobs) to distinguish main object from noise like isolated cells.
 * Square padding must center the cropped region, with pad_top/bottom/left/right calculated correctly; outputs must match exact expected sizes and positions, including preserving all non-zero values without alteration.
 * Subtle elements: Some patterns have asymmetric shapes (e.g., train1 has a central '8' with '3' borders and '6' insert); small disconnected components (e.g., train2's border '5's) should be excluded if not part of the main blob; rotations or symmetries in borders (e.g., train3's checkerboard '4's) may mislead density-based cropping.
 * Fallbacks for empty or invalid ranges (e.g., start > end) produce all-zero grids, but this shouldn't trigger on valid inputs; n=20 is hardcoded, assuming fixed input size.
 * All examples show the main pattern is roughly centered but offset, requiring dynamic detection rather than fixed coordinates.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def max_subarray_indices(arr: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Kadane's algorithm variant to find start/end indices of max sum subarray in row_nonzero.
    Useful for identifying contiguous dense row ranges, but may need adaptation for gapped blobs.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return 0, -1
    max_current = max_global = arr[0]
    current_start = 0
    global_start = 0
    global_end = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > max_current + arr[i]:
            max_current = arr[i]
            current_start = i
        else:
            max_current += arr[i]
        if max_current > max_global:
            max_global = max_current
            global_start = current_start
            global_end = i
    return global_start, global_end
```

```python
def compute_row_nonzero(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Computes count of >0 cells per row; essential for density-based row selection.
    """
    n = len(g)
    return [sum(x > 0 for x in row) for row in g]
```

(Note: No custom types like PuzzleElement are present; the above are core helpers from the attempt. No object extraction function is provided, but one could be added via flood-fill for connected components to better identify the main blob over density alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses density-based row selection (max subarray on row_nonzero) which works partially for finding core row ranges but fails to handle gapped or asymmetric blobs, leading to incorrect start/end (e.g., train1 includes extra top/bottom empty rows).
 * Column trimming after row selection is recomputed correctly in theory, but initial min_c/max_c uses untrimmed rows, causing width overestimation; this results in oversized squares with misplaced padding.
 * Height trimming when height > width removes low-density rows from ends, which works for borders but over-trims in train1 (cuts '3' borders) and train2 (distorts '3' and '4' shapes); the <2 non-zero check exacerbates this by removing sparse but essential rows.
 * Padding calculation (symmetric with //2) is mostly correct but fails due to wrong crop dimensions, leading to off-center or oversized outputs (e.g., train1 generated 18x18 vs expected 13x13).
 * All training examples fail: Train1 generated includes full-width empty borders and misses tight crop around central pattern (e.g., generated has wide left/right zeros, expected trims to 13 cols with specific '3','8','6' layout); Train2 generated shifts '3's and '4's incorrectly (e.g., row3 has '3's in wrong positions vs expected, and excludes some border '5's); Train3 generated flips or misaligns the central '1','2' pattern and includes extra '4' borders (e.g., row2 has isolated '1' misplaced vs expected tighter crop).
 * max_subarray_indices is helpful for dense contiguous cases but broken for non-contiguous (e.g., doesn't bridge small gaps in row_nonzero); the fallback all-zero grid is unhelpful and triggers incorrectly.
 * No connectivity check (e.g., flood-fill for main blob) means small isolated non-zeros (e.g., train2's stray '5's) pollute bounds; this is essential but missing.
 * Hardcoded n=20 assumes fixed size, which works for these inputs but limits generality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to crop a partial or multiple disconnected regions incorrectly, resulting in a tall, narrow 19x19? grid with scattered small patterns (e.g., isolated '5's and '3's in rows 1-4 and 10-14, a small '4' block in rows 12, and bottom '5' lines) instead of a single tight square bounding the main central blob.
 * It includes irrelevant top isolated '3's and '5's (rows 1-4), skips the dense mid-section (rows 6-8 with '5's), and fragments the lower '3'/'4'/'5' pattern (rows 10-18), suggesting over-trimming or wrong row_start/end; expected should consolidate the main lower-central pattern (e.g., the '3'/'4'/'5' cluster around rows 10-18, cols 10-18) into a ~9x9 square, excluding top noise.
 * Padding seems absent or asymmetric (many full-zero rows/cols), and the output isn't squared properly; it looks like multiple small objects were extracted separately rather than one main one, missing the puzzle's focus on the primary connected/dense region.
 * This indicates the density trimming fails on multi-blob inputs with varying densities, over-relying on max subarray without blob merging.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the input is a rectangular grid of integers (likely representing colored or patterned "pixels" in a larger canvas with empty space), and the goal is to extract, crop, and reformat the core content into a centered square grid of appropriate size, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while removing or padding around extraneous empty areas or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The core content appears to be a single main "object" or patterned block (e.g., a figure made of numbers like 3,8,6 in example 1, or 5,3,4 in example 2), often surrounded by empty (zero) rows/columns or decorative borders; the output must isolate this block without including outer noise.
 * Bounding box calculation must be tight: min/max rows and columns should only encompass the non-zero elements of the main object, but examples show that not all non-empty rows are part of the main block (e.g., isolated single rows like the top/bottom in example 1's expected output are excluded or repositioned).
 * Padding is centered and uses zeros, but the target size N is the max of row/col spans of the cropped block; however, outputs are sometimes not perfectly square or have asymmetric padding, suggesting the crop might include subtle extensions or exclude parts.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have multiple disconnected components (e.g., border-like lines of 3's or 5's in examples 1-3), but only the central/dense object is kept; empty rows within the block are preserved if they are part of the pattern. Rotations, mirrors, or value changes are not involved—outputs retain exact values and relative positions.
 * Outputs are always square (or padded to square), but input sizes vary (e.g., 13x13 in ex1, 11x11 in ex2/3); test input seems 13x13 with a central pattern of 3's,4's,5's flanked by 5's on sides.
 * Considerations across attempts: Longest consecutive non-empty rows may over-include if there are thin border rows; bounding columns must ignore outliers. No evidence of object extraction beyond simple bounding—complex shapes (e.g., holes or blobs) aren't handled yet. Padding order (rows then columns) can cause misalignment if crop is rectangular.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_non_empty_row(row: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    """Rule: Check if a row contains any non-zero value."""
    return any(x != 0 for x in row)
```
(This is useful for identifying potential content rows but may need refinement to detect main block vs. borders.)

```python
def find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.Tuple[int, int]:
    """Observation: Identify the longest sequence of consecutive non-empty rows in the grid."""
    # (Implementation as provided; helpful for initial row span but over-inclusive in examples.)
```
(This works for rough row detection but fails when borders create multiple sequences; could be extended to find densest block.)

```python
def find_bounding_columns(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int) -> tp.Tuple[int, int]:
    """Rule: Compute the minimum and maximum column indices with non-zero values in the main row block."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for column bounds but inherits row errors.)
```
(Good for tight horizontal cropping once rows are correct.)

```python
def crop_to_bounding_box(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Extract the subgrid from the bounding box of the main block."""
    # (Implementation as provided; core extraction tool, works if bounds are accurate.)
```
(Essential for isolating content; no issues here.)

```python
def compute_target_size(row_span: int, col_span: int) -> int:
    """Rule: Determine the side length of the square output grid as the maximum of row and column spans."""
    # (Implementation as provided; correct for squaring.)
```
(Simple and helpful.)

```python
def pad_rows_centered(grid: tp.List[tp.List[int]], target_n: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Pad the grid with empty rows centered to reach target size N."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful but can misalign if applied before full crop.)
```
(Helpful for vertical centering.)

```python
def pad_columns_centered(grid: tp.List[tp.List[int]], target_n: int) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    """Transformation: Pad the grid with empty columns centered to reach target size N."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for horizontal centering.)
```
(Helpful for horizontal centering; order with row padding matters.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on finding the longest consecutive non-empty row block, cropping to its bounding columns, and padding to a square— this correctly identifies a dense central area but over-includes border-like rows (e.g., top/bottom rows of 3's in ex1 generated but shifted/partial in expected).
 * What worked: Cropping and padding mechanics produce square outputs with preserved values; bounding columns tighten horizontal span well (e.g., reduces wide empty sides).
 * What didn't work: Row selection via longest consecutive block includes extraneous borders, leading to taller-than-needed crops (e.g., ex1 generated 13 rows with mismatched top/bottom vs. expected 13 but different positioning); padding centers incorrectly due to wrong initial crop, causing shifts (e.g., ex1 row 0 has 3's in cols 2,4 but expected has them in 3,10).
 * Ex1 differences: Generated has extra 3's in row0 col4, row2 has 8's/3's misplaced vs. expected (e.g., expected row2: 3 at col1,8 at3, etc.; unknown why but likely border inclusion); row10 in generated has 8's/3's but expected has different 8 pattern—crop too wide vertically.
 * Ex2 differences: Generated includes isolated row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] and pads to 11x11 but expected excludes/repositions it, has row1 as all zeros except 3, and different internal shifts (e.g., generated row4 has 3's at1-2 but expected row3 has 3's at3-5); seems to miss central density focus.
 * Ex3 differences: Generated crops to include alternating border rows (e.g., rows 1-2,9-10 as 4/0 patterns) but expected excludes them, focusing on inner 1/2 block (e.g., expected starts with border but crops inner 8 rows tightly); generated row7 has 1's misplaced vs. expected row6.
 * No object extraction beyond bounding—may need functions to detect/ignore thin borders or find "main blob" via connectivity/density.
 * Function `find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows` is partially helpful but broken for multi-component grids (over-inclusive); keep but refine.
 * Padding functions are helpful and correct in isolation but unhelpful when chained after bad crop.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it crops to a 13x13 square with heavy top/bottom padding (empty rows 0-2,10-12) and includes side 5's (cols 0-1,11-12) as part of the main block, but the central pattern (3's frame around 4's) seems shifted left/down compared to input density; input has 5's only on sides of rows 4,6,8 but generated embeds them fully, suggesting over-cropping horizontally/vertically without excluding borders.
 * It misses subtlety of isolating the inner 3/4 pattern (likely the "object") while perhaps treating side 5's as noise; output has symmetric padding but the embedded block is 7 rows high (3-9) vs. input's scattered rows, indicating longest-block logic grabbed too much vertically but not centered properly.
 * To handle test: Need better main-block detection (e.g., ignore side columns with uniform 5's) and tighter vertical crop to rows 3-9, padding to ~9x9 or max span, then re-pad to square—current output looks like a bloated version of the input without true extraction.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to process a square grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like values for shapes or images) by identifying and extracting the "main" non-zero connected component (object), cropping to its tight bounding box, and padding it to a square while preserving the original values and structure. The challenge involves correctly defining connectivity (8-connected), selecting the right component (central and largest), handling borders/frames that might connect to or surround the main object, and ensuring the extraction matches subtle positional details without introducing artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connectivity for components (diagonal neighbors count as connected), as non-zero cells can touch diagonally to form a single object.
 * The "main" component is typically the one closest to the grid center (measured by bounding box center distance to grid center), with ties broken by size (largest area); ignore small or peripheral components like borders or noise.
 * Borders or frames (e.g., repeating patterns of 3's or 4's around the edges) often form separate components or might connect to the main object, but they should be excluded—do not include them in the extraction unless they are part of the central shape.
 * After extracting the subgrid via bounding box, pad to the smallest square that fits (side length = max(height, width of subgrid)), centering the content with zeros; padding must be symmetric where possible but can be uneven if dimensions require it.
 * Grids may have multiple distinct values (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6 for object parts, 4/1/2 for shapes), but treat all non-zero as connectable regardless of value—do not segment by value.
 * Subtle positional mismatches occur frequently: e.g., in rotations or irregular shapes, the bounding box might shift, causing rows/columns to align differently; ensure the extracted subgrid retains exact relative positions.
 * Handle empty or single-cell cases gracefully (return zero-padded grid if no component).
 * Grids are always square input (n x n), but output must also be square (possibly smaller effective size after padding).
 * Easy to miss: Components might not be fully enclosed; test for cases where the main object touches the border, requiring careful separation; also, center calculation uses floating-point bounding box midpoint, so use precise distance formula.
 * Padding centers the subgrid, so calculate top/left pads as floor((n - dim)/2), with remainder on bottom/right.
 * Visually, outputs should "zoom in" on the central irregular shape, removing outer frames, but preserving internal details like holes or protrusions (e.g., isolated 6's or 8's).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implements 8-connected DFS for components, bounding box calculation, central selection with distance tiebreaker, subgrid extraction, and centered zero-padding—these are solid building blocks and worked for basic structure but failed to isolate the main object properly.
 * What worked: Component detection accurately finds non-zero groups (e.g., in example 1, it grabs a large central blob with 8's and 6's); padding centers content without distortion; handles empty cases by returning zero grid.
 * What didn't work: In all training examples, it incorrectly includes or excludes parts of the main object due to over-merging with borders (e.g., in example 1, generated includes extra 3's on left/top as part of the component, shifting the entire shape right/down compared to expected, where top row has 3's more centered and bottom has isolated 3's in columns 6-7; differences include row 0: generated [0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]—extra 3's and misaligned; row 2: generated has 8's starting earlier; row 10: generated [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,3,0]—missing 8's in positions 2-5, extra in 9; unknown why bounding box expanded to include border 3's, perhaps partial connectivity).
 * In example 2, generated mismatches inner 3's and 4's positions (e.g., row 1: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—3 shifted right; row 3: generated [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—extra 3's in cols 1-2, missing in 8; row 4: generated has 3's in 2 and 8 vs expected 3's in 1-2; likely selected a component that merged border 5's incorrectly with inner shapes).
 * In example 3, generated treats the 4's frame as part of or adjacent to the central 1/2 component, resulting in a larger bounding box that includes the entire frame (e.g., row 0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—starts with 4 instead of 0, and pattern is shifted; row 2: generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] includes frame 4's at ends vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] which crops tighter, starting inner content earlier; row 5: generated [0,4,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,4] vs expected [4,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,4,0]—rotated or flipped feel, with 4's misplaced; unknown exact cause, but likely frame 4's form a connected ring around the center, pulling the bounding box outward).
 * Overall, the attempt overestimates the main component by including border-connected cells, leading to shifted/wider outputs; selection metric works but needs refinement to explicitly exclude border-like components (e.g., those touching edges).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and mostly correct, though the full program() integrates them poorly for border separation; do not discard, but enhance select_main_component to penalize edge-touching components.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output [[5,5],[0,0]] appears correct at first glance for a tiny 2x2 input grid (assuming input is [[5,5],[0,0]]), as the non-zero cells [5,5] in row 0 form a connected component (side-by-side, 8-connected), bounding box is row 0 col 0-1, extraction is [[5,5]], padding to 2x2 adds [0,0] below, matching exactly—no border issues here since it's small and no extraneous components.
 * However, it only "makes sense" if the puzzle rules apply uniformly; for larger cases, this simple pass doesn't demonstrate handling of the core subtlety (border exclusion), so it might coincidentally work but not generalize—watch for tests with frames around small objects, where it could wrongly include them and shift the [5,5] row.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify and extract the primary "image" or figure from a sparse grid of positive integers (likely representing colored pixels or segments of a logo/object), crop it to a tight bounding box (possibly allowing limited gaps for incomplete rows/columns), pad it to a centered square of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, and output the result as a square grid. The extraction must preserve the relative positions and values of the non-zero elements while ignoring empty borders and disconnected noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid represents a 2D image with 0s as background/empty and positive integers as filled pixels of different "colors" or types (e.g., 3,5,6,8 in train1; 3,4,5 in train2; 1,2,4 in train3), and the output must retain these exact values without alteration.
 * Cropping should focus on the densest or most continuous block of non-zeros, treating the grid as potentially containing a single main object with possible thin gaps (e.g., single empty rows/columns might be tolerated, but larger gaps separate components).
 * Padding must be even (centered) on all sides to form a square, using 0s, but the square size is max(cropped_height, cropped_width), not the original grid size—subtly, this can lead to oversized outputs if cropping is loose.
 * Disconnected components (e.g., separate blobs of the same or different numbers) should likely be ignored except for the main/largest one; the test input has multiple scattered clusters (5's in rows 6-7 and 17-19; 3's and 4 in rows 9-15), suggesting the program must select the primary figure, not union all.
 * Row/column selection prioritizes maximum "density" (e.g., sum of non-zeros or count of non-empty lines), but with gap tolerance: train1 expected allows some irregularity (e.g., partial rows at top/bottom), while generated includes extras like full empty rows.
 * Fallback bounding box logic (min-max non-zero positions) is sometimes needed if no perfect contiguous subarray exists, but it must not include large empty margins.
 * Outputs are square but sized to the cropped content (e.g., train2 expected is 10x10, not 12x12), implying tight cropping is key; loose cropping bloats the square unnecessarily.
 * Subtle asymmetry in expected outputs: train1 expected has uneven padding (e.g., more empty space on right/bottom), but generated is more symmetric yet includes unwanted elements (e.g., extra 3's in row0/col2).
 * Rotation, mirroring, or reordering is not needed—preserve original orientation and positions relative to crop.
 * Edge cases: fully disconnected grids (like test) require selecting the largest/densest component; all-zero grids should output empty square of original size? But program returns n x n zeros, which may be correct.
 * Non-zero counts per row/column are useful metrics, but "sum of values" vs. "count of non-zeros" matters—program uses count, but if values represent thickness, sum might be better (unknown, but generated mismatches suggest count is insufficient).
 * Grids can be non-square originally, but outputs are always square; n varies (13 in train1, 12 in train2/3, 20 in test).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies the need for density-based cropping using non-zero counts per row/column and gap-tolerant subarray search, which partially worked for finding approximate bounds in contiguous cases but failed due to incorrect gap tolerances (e.g., max_gap=1 for rows included extra sparse rows in train1, leading to 14x14 instead of 13x13).
 * Cropping logic for columns used max_gap=0 (strict contiguous), with fallback to min-max bounding, but this over-included sparse columns in train1 (e.g., generated has extra 0's and shifted 3's on left/right) and failed to isolate the main figure in train2/3 (generated 12x12 includes borders, expected 10x10 crops tighter).
 * Padding to max(h,w) with centered 0's is correct in principle but produced oversized/inaccurate squares because upstream cropping was loose; e.g., train1 generated includes unwanted top/bottom rows with isolated 3's, mismatching expected's tighter crop (e.g., expected row0 has isolated 3's but different positions).
 * For train1, generated mismatched blob shapes: e.g., row2 has [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,...] vs. expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why, possibly due to row selection including row1 (all 3's) but shifting columns wrong; also added extra bottom empty row.
 * For train2, generated included full empty borders (12x12) and misplaced elements (e.g., row1 [0,5,0,5,...] vs. expected starting directly with [5,0,5,...] in a 10x10 crop), failing to exclude outer empties and select the inner 3/4/5 figure tightly; fallback column logic didn't trigger properly.
 * For train3, similar issue: generated 12x12 with borders, mismatching expected 10x10 crop (e.g., generated row2 [0,0,4,0,4,...] includes extras vs. expected direct [0,4,0,4,...]); strict column gap=0 excluded valid irregular parts like scattered 1's/2's.
 * No object extraction function was present, but one could be added to find connected components (e.g., via flood-fill on non-zeros) to isolate the main blob, as density alone misses disconnected noise.
 * The max_subarray function is helpful and mostly correct but needs tunable gaps (e.g., try 0-2) and perhaps sum-of-values instead of count for density.
 * compute_row_nonzero is useful and correct, but a column version is implied and works partially.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt—all are relevant, but the overall program lacks component selection, leading to inclusion of noise.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a 20x20 grid (original size) with only a small cropped/padded region of 3's,4's,5's in the top-leftish area (rows ~6-14, cols ~7-12), but ignores lower 5's (rows 17-19) and pads excessively with zeros everywhere else, resulting in a mostly empty grid that doesn't isolate a single main figure.
 * Compared to input, it captured the middle 3/4 cluster but missed the top 5's (rows 6-7) and bottom 5's (rows 17-19), suggesting the row selection with max_gap=1 picked only one component; expected likely needs to select the largest/densest (the 3/4 block) and crop tightly to ~6x6 or so, padded to square without the full 20x20 bloat.
 * The output makes partial sense as a cropped attempt but is incorrect because it doesn't form a compact square representation of the primary content—it's diluted by huge zero padding, and the positioned content (e.g., 5's in rows 6-7 of output match input's top 5's? Wait, no—output rows 6-7 have 5's in cols 7-11, matching input row6-7, but then jumps to 3's in row9-15, indicating it unioned non-contiguous rows, which bloated h=10+ but with gaps, violating gap tolerance.
 * To handle test, must add connected component analysis to pick one main object (likely the densest 3/4 block in rows9-15, cols6-13), crop tightly (h~7, w~8, pad to 8x8), excluding scattered 5's as noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to clean up a grid by isolating the core pattern or "object" (e.g., letters, shapes, or symbols formed by non-zero cells) while removing surrounding noise, borders, or extraneous connected elements, then cropping tightly and padding to a centered square if needed. The process emphasizes distinguishing the main blob from decorative or irregular borders that are often connected but should be excluded to match the expected clean, minimal representations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids often have outer borders (e.g., 3's in example 1, 5's in example 2, 4's in example 3) that form connected components of non-zero cells but are noise; the main pattern is typically an inner, denser, or more structured blob that may not be the absolute largest component.
 * Use 8-connectivity for components to capture diagonal connections in patterns like letters or shapes, but avoid merging borders with the core if they touch—subtlety is detecting "frame-like" structures vs. solid fills.
 * Cropping must be to the tight bounding box of the main component only, preserving internal zeros (holes or gaps) but excluding isolated noise within the crop if it's not part of the pattern.
 * Padding to square uses the max dimension, centered symmetrically, with zeros; however, if the input is already square-like, no padding occurs, but the core issue is often pre-padding cleanup.
 * Expected outputs show irregular borders adjusted (e.g., some border cells zeroed out or shifted), suggesting rules like removing single-cell protrusions, handling asymmetric noise, or prioritizing components by density/shape over size.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have internal components (e.g., holes with 0's inside non-zeros) that must stay; borders may not fully enclose (e.g., gaps in test input); values like 3,4,5,6,8 represent different "inks" but connectivity is by non-zero regardless of value.
 * All non-zero cells are treated equally for connectivity, but outputs preserve original values—don't normalize or change them.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return empty; small isolated cells are noise; multiple components require selecting the "primary" one (not always largest, as borders can be bigger).
 * Considerations across attempts: Flood fill/DFS is reliable for components but needs filtering (e.g., by size threshold, perimeter-to-area ratio for "frame" detection, or excluding components touching grid edges).

 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented connected components, bounding box cropping, and centered square padding, which worked for basic structure preservation and output formatting (e.g., kept internal values and zeros intact).
 * What didn't work: Relied on the largest component, which included borders/noise (e.g., full 3-border in train 1 generated vs. expected irregular/partial border with some 0's and shifted positions; similar for 5-borders in train 2 and 4-borders in train 3), leading to oversized crops that retained unwanted elements.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 3's in top/bottom rows (e.g., full row of 3's in row 1/11 vs. expected sparse 3's and 0's); internal 8's and 6's shifted or added erroneously (e.g., row 2 has 8's where expected has 0's); bottom row has misplaced 3's.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated includes border 5's bleeding into inner pattern (e.g., row 3 has 3's in cols 1-2 where expected has 0's; row 4 has extra 3's and missing 4's in positions); row 1 has 3 where expected has all 0's except end.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated rotates or includes border as part of pattern (e.g., row 0 starts with 4's alternating vs. expected starting with 0; inner 1's and 2's misplaced, like row 2 has extra 0's and 1's shifted); overall looks like border merged without exclusion.
 * Function `get_largest_component` is broken/not helpful as-is (always picks size-max, ignoring border-like components; suggest filtering by not touching edges or by shape metrics).
 * Padding functions (e.g., `calculate_vertical_padding`, `apply_padding`) are helpful and correct but underutilized since crops are too large, resulting in no/minimal padding.
 * `crop_to_bounds` preserves isolated cells within bounds (good), but since wrong component is chosen, it includes noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output matches the input grid exactly (7x7 with irregular 3/4 border and inner pattern), which does not look correct because prior training examples show the need for cleanup—likely the expected output should exclude or zero out the incomplete border (e.g., top-left 3's in rows 0-1 might be noise, inner 4 as main, with tighter crop/pad to square without edge protrusions like row 6's lone 3).
 * It makes sense as a "no-op" from the program's logic (largest component spans nearly whole grid, bounding box is full 7x7, no padding needed), but fails the puzzle's intent since borders aren't removed, leading to unclean pattern (e.g., asymmetric 0's and 3's around the central 4 and lines).
 * To handle test: Program needs border exclusion (e.g., ignore components touching all four edges) to crop just the inner cross-like pattern with 4, padding to square if height/width differ after cleanup.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely pixel art or figure extraction) where the task is to identify, isolate, and normalize the primary "object" or figure from a larger scene, typically by extracting a connected region of non-zero cells, cropping to its bounding box, resizing/padding to a square grid, and possibly applying transformations like rotation or alignment to match a canonical orientation. The output must exactly replicate specific expected layouts, which appear to emphasize precise positioning, exclusion of background or border elements, and correct handling of multiple components or numbers (e.g., 3 as borders, 6/8 as inner shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use numbers (e.g., 3 for borders/frames, 6/8/4/1/2 for object parts) to represent distinct visual elements; zeros are empty space, and connectivity defines "objects," but 8-connectivity (diagonals) may over-connect borders or backgrounds, leading to inclusion of unwanted areas.
 * The "main" object is often the largest connected component of non-zeros, but it must exclude persistent borders/frames (e.g., 3's or 4's that form enclosures) and focus on inner irregular shapes; subtle: borders may be connected but should be omitted or treated separately to avoid bloating the bounding box.
 * Cropping uses the tight bounding box (min/max row/col), then pads to the max side length square with zeros, but placement must be top-left aligned in the new grid—however, expected outputs show shifts, rotations (e.g., 90-degree turns), or flips to "upright" the figure, suggesting orientation normalization based on asymmetry (e.g., making protrusions point down or centering).
 * Padding and alignment are critical: new grid is square, but expected may have uneven padding (e.g., more zeros on top/bottom) to match visual centering or specific offsets; easy to miss that the entire output must be exactly the expected size and positions, not just the shape.
 * Multiple components exist (e.g., inner blobs of different numbers like 6 and 8 may be separate but part of one "object" if visually cohesive); the code merges them if connected, but expected sometimes separates or reorients independently.
 * Subtle elements: In enclosed scenes (e.g., train1/3), the main object is inside a frame—code includes frame if connected; rotation/flip is needed if input is sideways (e.g., train3 generated vs. expected shows row/col swap like a transpose or 90-degree clockwise rotation). Handle varying grid sizes (10x13, 10x10, 7x7) by outputting square but preserving relative positions. Non-zero cells must retain exact values; zeros must match precisely, including sparse placements.
 * Across attempts: No input grids provided, so infer from outputs—expected often has "cleaner" or reoriented inner shapes with borders detached; test case likely a simple shape (e.g., cross or letter-like with 3's) that needs similar extraction/rotation. Avoid over-cropping (losing protrusions) or under-padding (mismatched sizes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it correctly identifies non-zero positions and uses connected components to extract regions, which works for isolating potential objects but fails on all trainings due to including connected borders/frames as part of the main component (e.g., train1/3 bloat the shape with 3's/4's).
 * What worked: Bounding box cropping and square padding logic produces a normalized size/output; component extraction via stack/visited avoids revisits and handles sparse grids well.
 * What didn't work: 8-connectivity merges inner objects with enclosing borders (e.g., train1 generated includes extra 3's in rows 1/3/13 vs. expected's sparser top/bottom; train3 generated has border rows swapped vs. expected, suggesting no rotation applied); largest component assumption fails when borders are biggest (e.g., train2 generated crops to 10x10 but misplaces 5's/3's/4's, losing some zeros and connections).
 * Train1: Generated has denser 3's/8's/6's with incorrect top row [0,0,3,0,3,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,...] (extra 3's, wrong offsets); bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs. expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (misaligned protrusions); inner rows like row3 [3,3,8,8,0,...] vs. [0,3,0,8,0,...] show over-connected 3's/8's, possibly from diagonal links.
 * Train2: Generated starts with [0,0,5,0,5,5,...] but expected [5,0,5,0,5,5,...] (missing leading 5's, wrong alignment); row4 [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...] (extra 3's, 4's shifted); overall shape is cropped but rotated/misplaced, e.g., 5's frame not fully enclosed as in expected.
 * Train3: Generated border alternates starting with 4 in col0 row0 vs. expected starting with 0 (appears as 90-degree rotation or transpose needed); inner [4,0,0,0,0,1,...] vs. [0,4,0,1,1,...] shows slight shifts in 1's/2's positions, likely from including full connected 4's border.
 * find_connected_components is helpful but broken for this puzzle due to 8-connectivity (try 4-connectivity: only [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)] to detach diagonals); positions extraction is solid and reusable.
 * No other functions provided; the main program is relevant but incomplete (add rotation, e.g., check orientations and rotate grid 90/180/270 degrees to match expected asymmetry).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it appears to be a tight crop of a 3's-only shape (forming a sort of "E" or asymmetric cross in 7x7) with top-left alignment and bottom protrusion [0,0,0,0,3,0,0], but without input grid, it likely includes unwanted connected elements or fails orientation like in trainings (e.g., if input has a rotated figure or border, this misses rotation/centering, leading to mismatched positions). It makes sense as a cropped connected component of 3's but not as the full puzzle solution, since trainings show expected outputs require detaching inners, adding sparse zeros, or reorienting—here, the dense 3's block and uneven padding (e.g., row7 has isolated 3's) probably doesn't match an "upright" canonical form, and size (7x7) assumes max side without verification against expected subtlety like frame exclusion.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean up a colored grid (likely representing a segmented image or diagram) by identifying and removing small or peripheral connected components (blobs of the same integer value), then trimming empty borders to create a minimal bounding box, and finally padding to a square shape while preserving the core structure of larger components. The expected outputs suggest a focus on retaining main "objects" or "shapes" (e.g., letters, symbols, or diagrams formed by colored regions) while eliminating noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts, especially those in peripheral or high-row positions, to match a compact, cleaned representation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right) and defined by matching integer values (colors like 3,5,6,8); size is counted by number of cells, and small ones (size <=2) should be omitted only if they are "peripheral" – specifically, those with minimum row index >=15 (assuming row 0 is top, so "high y" means lower rows? Wait, code uses min_r_comp >=15, but examples suggest top rows are low indices; this may be inverted or grid-specific).
 * Omission/resetting: After identifying a small component, reflood it with 0s using the original grid to avoid visited array issues, but ensure it doesn't accidentally affect larger components of the same color.
 * Trimming: Extract the minimal bounding box of non-zero cells post-omission; if no non-zeros remain, return empty; subtleties include handling uneven shapes (e.g., examples show irregular blobs like letters 'E' or 'F' in colors).
 * Padding: Add zero rows/columns only on right and bottom to reach max(h,w) side length; preserve top-left alignment.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have "noise" like isolated 1-2 cell blobs in borders or specific rows (e.g., example 1 has stray 3's in top/bottom rows to remove); colors represent distinct objects (don't merge across colors); no holes mentioned, but examples have enclosed areas (e.g., 6's might form loops); row indexing matters – example 1 expected removes top-left 3's but keeps some bottom ones, suggesting peripheral means outer edges or specific row thresholds; example 3 shows heavy trimming needed from a sparse 15x15 to 10x10, implying removal of all but central multi-color structure; test input has vertical stacks of 5's/3's separated by empty rows, suggesting need to remove isolated small groups and connect or preserve main horizontal structures.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connections; handle empty grids gracefully; post-trim grid may not be square initially, but padding ensures it; potential over-removal (e.g., keeping size=3+ even if peripheral); row threshold >=15 seems arbitrary/misapplied (example 1 has rows up to 12, so maybe threshold is wrong or rows are bottom-up).
 * Other considerations: Examples suggest puzzle is about "object extraction" from noisy scans (e.g., OCR-like cleanup); test input has long empty rows/columns, so trimming must be aggressive; colors like 4/6 may form "filled" shapes, while 3/5/8 are outlines; don't assume square input – outputs vary (13x13, 10x10, 10x10).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt shown, composing omission, trim, and pad; it partially understands component detection and cleanup but fails all trainings due to incomplete removal (e.g., keeps some small 3's in ex1 top row [positions 2 and 4 in gen vs expected only at 3 and 10]; ex1 row2 starts with [3,3,...] vs expected [0,3,...], suggesting didn't remove left-peripheral size=2 blob; ex1 bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] – partial removal but wrong positions).
 * Ex2: Generated keeps extra 3's in row3 [0,3,3,0,...] vs expected [0,0,3,0,...]; row4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0] – mismatches in 3/4 placement, likely didn't remove small isolated 3's or mis-trimmed; overall shape is close but blob connectivity wrong (e.g., 4's not fully filled).
 * Ex3: Generated retains full 15x15 with sparse top/bottom (e.g., isolated 1's/4's at edges) vs expected compact 10x10 central structure; omission didn't trigger (components larger? or threshold >=15 skips all since grid is 15 rows, min_r=0 <15); trim/pad ineffective as bounding box includes empties.
 * Function `omit_peripheral_small_components` is helpful but broken: row threshold too high (skips removals in small grids); reset uses original g but may miss if visited interferes; doesn't handle "peripheral" as edge-distance (e.g., cols 0 or rows 0/last).
 * `trim_empty_borders` is helpful and correct in logic but fails if upstream has unremoved noise expanding bounds.
 * `pad_to_square` is helpful and correct but irrelevant if prior steps wrong.
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., no function to list all components by size/color/min-max bounds); attempt misses that some "small" might be size>2 if peripheral, or need to remove based on position not just size/row.
 * General: No handling of multi-color interactions (e.g., ex1 has 3 as background/outline?); attempt assumes no holes but ex1/2 have potential enclosed 0's in 6/4.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a sparse 19x19 grid retaining isolated small stacks (e.g., vertical 5's in cols 3-4 rows 0-4, horizontal 5's in rows 7-8 cols 11-15, 3's in row10 cols11-12 and row15 col13) without removal, and long empty rows/columns (e.g., rows 5-6,9,16-18 all zero), suggesting omission didn't trigger (components size=3+? or threshold issue) and trim failed to crop to central multi-color structure around rows10-15 cols10-18 (3's/4's/5's forming shapes); expected should be a trimmed square (likely ~8x10 or similar) with main blobs (e.g., 3's as bars, 5's as borders, 4 as filler) compacted, removing top isolated 5's/3's and bottom strays; this looks like no effective cleanup, preserving noise.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored pixels (represented by integers like 3, 5, 6, 8) where the task is to identify and extract the "main" object—likely a composite shape formed by nearby connected components of the same or different colors—then rotate it to a canonical orientation (e.g., upright) based on color cues, and output the rotated grid with the object centered or aligned in a minimal bounding box, omitting extraneous pixels or noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent pixels of the exact same color; different colors do not connect directly, but "meta-components" group nearby components (via centroid distance) to form composite objects.
 * The "main" object is the largest meta-component by total pixel count, ignoring smaller isolated blobs or noise (e.g., stray pixels or small groups).
 * Rotation is determined by specific "cue" colors in the main object: presence of 5 triggers clockwise (cw) rotation, 1 triggers counterclockwise (ccw), otherwise default to 180-degree rotation; this seems to "unrotate" the object based on asymmetric markers.
 * After extraction, pixels are shifted relative to the aggregate bounding box (bbox) minimums, rotated in the new orientation (which may swap height/width for 90-degree rotations), and placed in a new grid of the rotated dimensions; zeros fill the rest, but the output should match the expected shape, size, and positioning exactly.
 * Subtleties include: threshold for meta-grouping (e.g., 5.5 units via Euclidean distance on centroids) must be tuned to capture intended composites without merging unrelated parts; bbox computation uses min/max rows/columns across grouped components; rotations must handle coordinate transformations precisely (e.g., cw: new_row = old_col, new_col = new_width-1 - old_row_offset) to avoid off-by-one errors or flipped placements.
 * Outputs are lists of lists (rows), with exact dimensions and pixel placements matching expectations; extraneous rows/columns of zeros or misaligned shapes indicate failure.
 * Noise omission is key—small components (e.g., single pixels or tiny blobs) should be ignored unless part of the main meta-group.
 * Color sets drive decisions but only for rotation; all colors in the main group are preserved post-rotation.
 * Edge cases: rotated grids may change aspect ratio (h↔w for cw/ccw); 180-degree keeps dimensions but inverts positions; if no main object, return minimal empty grid.
 * Potential pitfalls: centroid approximation via bbox center may inaccurately group if shapes are irregular; stack-based flood fill must mark visited correctly to avoid infinite loops or missed pixels.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies connected components and meta-grouping via proximity, which works well for composite objects (as seen in training example 3 passing).
 * Rotation detection via color cues (5 for cw, 1 for ccw, else 180) is a core principle that aligns with puzzle asymmetry, but fails when cues are absent or misdetected (e.g., training 1 defaults to 180 but placements are off).
 * Extraction of largest meta-component by pixel count effectively omits noise in cases like training 3, but in training 1, it includes too much or misaligns the bbox, leading to partial shape matches.
 * Threshold of 5.5 for meta-grouping works for some densities (training 3) but may be too loose/tight for others, causing over-merging or under-grouping (e.g., training 2 scatters pixels instead of compacting).
 * Centroid-based bbox centers approximate well for symmetric blobs but may err on irregular shapes, contributing to incorrect distances in training 1 and 2.
 * Pixel extraction and rotation application preserve colors and positions mostly correctly, but coordinate transforms have off-by-one or inversion issues (e.g., training 1 generated first row [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]—3's shifted right; last row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—misplaced and wrong count).
 * In training 2, generated a sparse 15x15-ish grid with isolated pixels (e.g., row 0: [0,3,0,0,...]; row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]) vs compact 10x10 expected (e.g., row 0: [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5])—failed to group/rotate into dense shape, possibly due to poor meta-detection or wrong rotation (colors include 5, so cw attempted but dimensions wrong: generated tall/thin vs expected square-ish).
 * Training 1 mismatches blob shapes in rows 0,1,6,12 (unknown reason—possibly bbox shift or rotation not inverting fully; 3's and 6's positions swapped or flipped incorrectly).
 * Training 2 omits consolidation, leaving unrotated fragments (e.g., 5's and 3's not aligned into expected borders).
 * The main program orchestrates well but bbox computation and rotation placement need tighter offset handling (e.g., no padding added; exact min_r/min_c subtraction).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all provided are relevant, though rotation may need validation for edge cases like zero-height/width.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x10 grid with vertical 5's on the left (rows 1-2,4-9), horizontal 3's in the middle forming a shape with a 4 inset (row 6 col 6), and bottom 3's— it looks like a partial frame or letter-like shape, but density feels low (many zeros) and asymmetric, suggesting incomplete grouping or wrong rotation.
 * It does not look fully correct: the 5's form a sparse column, 3's a loose blob with 4 inside, but if the puzzle expects a rotated/aligned compact object (e.g., cw since 5 present), this may be pre-rotation or mis-extracted; expected likely denser (like training 2's compact form) with 5's repositioned to borders, 4 centered, and no stray zeros in a minimal bbox.
 * Differences from intuition: positions like 4 at (6,6) seem arbitrary; if cw rotation was applied, 5's should map horizontally—current verticality suggests either no rotation triggered or transform failed; overall, it resembles unprocessed input more than a "solved" upright object, missing the consolidation seen in correct training 3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Properties

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions, connections, or property relationships between components (or their properties) that appear in **every** puzzle. These are limited to patterns that hold across all examples without exception. I focused only on elements with clear, direct interactions (e.g., one property influencing another's transformation or preservation) that are consistent and not forced. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., non-interacting single pixels with no positional ties to others) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or provided. Where a full explanation of a transformation cannot be determined from the data (e.g., exact mapping rule), it is noted as unknown rather than speculated.

- **Color preservation across corresponding components**: Every component in the output matches the color of a specific input component (e.g., Green to Green, Pink to Pink, Maroon to Maroon, Orange to Orange, Yellow to Yellow, Blue to Blue, Red to Red). No color changes or cross-color merges occur. This indicates color as a fixed identifier linking input components to their output counterparts, unaffected by position or other properties.

- **Pixel count preservation for corresponding components**: Each output component has the exact same pixel count as its input counterpart (e.g., 48 for Green, 12 for Pink, 37 for large Maroon, 3 for small Maroon in train 1; 5 for each Green, 6 for Yellow, various 1-4 for Orange/Blue/Red in trains 2/3). Pixel count acts as a unique identifier tying components across input/output, showing that the internal "mass" of a component is conserved regardless of positional changes. This holds for all included components, with no splitting or combining.

- **Holes count preservation for corresponding components**: The number of holes (0 or 1) remains identical for each matched component (e.g., holes=1 for Green/Pink/large Maroon in train 1; holes=0 for all in trains 2/3). Holes interact with the component's structure (possibly indicating internal voids relative to the shape's silhouette), and this property is invariant under the transformation, suggesting holes are intrinsic to the component and not affected by external factors like position or color.

- **Global positional transformation applied to all included components' bboxes**: The bounding boxes (bbox) of all corresponding components undergo a consistent unknown transformation (likely a rigid whole-image operation like rotation, reflection, or normalization, as relative positions shift predictably but not via simple translation). For example:
  - In every case, output bboxes start from low coordinates (e.g., near [0,0] for main structures), indicating a normalization interaction where the "main" area's position influences all others (e.g., main container/frame bbox in train 1 shifts to [0,0,12,12], pulling inner components like Pink/Maroon along; similar top-left anchoring in trains 2/3 for Orange/Green/Yellow/Blue clusters).
  - Relative positioning is preserved in a transformed way: Components that overlap or are nested in input (e.g., Pink inside Maroon inside Green in train 1; Yellow inside/combined with Green in train 2; Red/Blue amid Yellows in train 3) maintain nesting or adjacency post-transformation, but with altered orientations (e.g., vertical bars become horizontal or vice versa). The exact mapping (e.g., 90-degree rotation relative to a frame) is unknown from the data alone.
  - This transformation links all positions interdependently—no component's bbox changes in isolation; all shift cohesively relative to the overall structure.

- **Inclusion/exclusion based on positional interaction with main structure**: Components interact via position with a "main structure" (e.g., the Green frame in train 1, the assembled Green/Orange bars in train 2, the central Yellow/Blue/Red cluster in train 3). Only components whose bbox overlaps or is adjacent to the main structure's bbox are included in the output and transformed; isolated small components (pixels ≤2, holes=0, no bbox overlap with main) positioned as outliers (e.g., high y-values beyond main area in trains 1/2, or extreme x-values in train 3) are consistently omitted. This shows position as a gatekeeper property: outlier status (distance from main bbox) determines interaction with the transformation process, affecting inclusion. Omitted components have no further connections.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-position effects like "Green always causes shift in Orange," as colors vary per puzzle; no consistent hole-to-color or shape-specific transformations beyond preservation; no edge/silhouette effects on movement, as silhouettes aren't detailed enough in the data). Components without these ties (e.g., purely standalone with no positional/structural link) are irrelevant and excluded.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 11:30:19] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing grid-based visual representations (likely pixel art or shape drawings with numbered "colors" or labels) to isolate and transform the main object or shape, such as cropping to a bounding box and padding to a square while preserving the internal structure. The goal appears to be extracting a central or primary visual element, possibly removing or adjusting borders/noise, but the current approach over-connects disparate elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use numbers (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6/4/1/2 for internal shapes) to represent distinct visual elements; connectivity should likely be based on SAME value (4-connected or 8-connected) rather than any non-zero, as different numbers form separate "objects" (e.g., border vs. filled shapes).
 * The "main" object may not be the absolute largest component by cell count; it could be the largest SAME-value component, or one that forms a coherent shape (e.g., ignoring thin borders or noise); in examples, borders (3s or 4s/5s) seem partially retained but adjusted.
 * Bounding box extraction must tightly fit the selected component without including extraneous zeros or adjacent but unrelated numbers; padding to square should center the content but examples show irregular padding or shifts (e.g., uneven top/bottom rows).
 * Subtleties include handling disconnected parts of the same number (e.g., if border has gaps, it might split into multiple components); possible need to merge or select specific components (e.g., non-border shapes); outputs preserve number values but rearrange or omit parts, suggesting not pure cropping but transformation (e.g., removing outer frame or normalizing orientation).
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs are not always square-padded identically (e.g., train 1 expected has asymmetric 3s in top/bottom rows); grids may have implicit backgrounds (0s) that need trimming precisely; test input has a near-symmetric 3-frame with central 4, but output might need to isolate the 4 or adjust the frame.
 * Consider orientation/rotation: Train 3 expected swaps row patterns from generated, suggesting possible need to normalize (e.g., rotate to match a standard top-left).
 * All examples show multi-object scenes (border + internals); solution must identify "primary" via rules like size, position (central), or type (non-border).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_eight_neighbors(r: int, c: int, n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```
(This 8-way neighbor function is useful for component detection if 8-connectivity is needed; could modify for 4-way by removing diagonals.)

```python
def find_all_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = set()
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != 0 and (i, j) not in visited:
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    if (cr, cc) in visited:
                        continue
                    visited.add((cr, cc))
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_eight_neighbors(cr, cc, n):
                        if g[nr][nc] != 0 and (nr, nc) not in visited:  # Note: Change to g[nr][nc] == g[cr][cc] for same-value components
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder is helpful for extracting objects but currently broken for this puzzle as it connects any non-zero; fix by adding same-value check to isolate shapes like 8s vs. 6s.)

```python
def get_bounding_box(component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    min_r = min(r for r, c in component)
    max_r = max(r for r, c in component)
    min_c = min(c for r, c in component)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in component)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c

def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[min_c : max_c + 1] for row in g[min_r : max_r + 1]]

def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return []
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    n = max(h, w)
    pad_top = (n - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = n - h - pad_top
    pad_left = (n - w) // 2
    pad_right = n - w - pad_left
    padded = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            padded[pad_top + i][pad_left + j] = grid[i][j]
    return padded
```
(Bounding box, subgrid extraction, and centered square padding are helpful and mostly correct for cropping/isolating; they work well if fed the right component, but current selection fails.)

```python
def select_largest_component(components: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not components:
        return []
    return max(components, key=len)
```
(This selector is helpful but incomplete; may need to filter by value (e.g., ignore border number like 3) or position (e.g., central component) instead of just size.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses 8-connected components on any non-zero cells, which merges borders (e.g., 3s) with internals (e.g., 8s/6s), leading to oversized bounding boxes that include unwanted parts; this fails all training examples by producing bloated or misaligned outputs.
 * Train 1: Generated includes full border+internals in bounding box, resulting in mismatched positions (e.g., row 0 has 3 at col 2/4 vs. expected col 3/10; row 2 has extra 3s and wrong 8 placements; bottom row has scattered 0s vs. expected 3s at col 5/7); padding centers but doesn't match expected asymmetries (unknown why, possibly due to over-inclusion).
 * Train 2: Generated mishandles internal shapes (e.g., row 3 has 3s/4s in wrong spots like extra 3 at col1/2 vs. expected 0s; row 4 has 5 at col0 but expected 5 at col0 with shifted 3s; overall, border 5s are preserved but internals like 3s/4s are distorted, likely from merged components).
 * Train 3: Generated outputs the full grid with border 4s and internals 1/2, but expected reorders rows (e.g., starts with [0,4,0,...] vs. generated [4,0,4,...], suggesting rotation or row swap needed; internals like 2s are in wrong bounding box, e.g., row4 has 1 at col2 vs. expected different; border seems flipped).
 * Function `find_all_components` is broken for this puzzle (connects different numbers; don't use as-is; modify for same-value).
 * Function `select_largest_component` is not helpful alone (picks overall largest, which is often the border, but puzzle may want internal shapes; consider alternatives like max per value).
 * No omission of small/noise components (e.g., single 4s); no handling for multiple same-value components (e.g., split borders).
 * Padding works but interacts badly with wrong bounding boxes, causing shifts (e.g., train 1 bottom row misalignment).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to crop/pad a near-full view of the input (7x7 frame of 3s with central 4 at row3 col3), but it includes the entire border without isolation, resulting in a symmetric frame that retains all non-zeros; this does not look correct because training examples suggest internals (like the 4) should be emphasized or border adjusted (e.g., gaps filled or border trimmed), and the output has redundant 0s at bottom-right that might need tightening.
 * Compared to input, output adds no major changes but fails to "extract" (e.g., if puzzle wants just the 4 shape padded, this overincludes 3s; if border is noise, it should be removed); asymmetries in input (e.g., bottom row 0s) are preserved but may need normalization.
 * Does not match expected patterns from training (e.g., no row swaps or value-specific cropping); likely incorrect as it would fail similarly to train cases by merging 3s+4 into one component.

[2025-10-02 11:30:32] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious and consistent interactions/connections observed **in every example**. These are limited to properties and components that show clear, direct relationships (e.g., preservation or collective effect) across all train cases. No high-level solving or assumptions about the overall puzzle are included. Connections that vary by color, are not present in all examples, or cannot be directly linked (e.g., specific shape-to-shape overlaps, since bboxes do not consistently indicate adjacency or containment across all cases) are excluded. If a potential connection (like positional transformation) cannot be fully explained without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

#### Preserved Properties (Direct Link: Input Property → Output Property for Corresponding Shapes)
- **Color preservation**: Every shape's color in the input directly corresponds to a shape of the same color in the output, with no color changes or new colors introduced for matching components. This holds for all colors present (e.g., Maroon/Pink/Green in train 1, Orange/Green/Yellow in train 2, Blue/Yellow/Red in train 3).
- **Holes preservation**: The number of holes (holes count) for each individual shape in the input is identical to its corresponding shape in the output. This applies universally, whether holes=0 (consistent in trains 2 and 3) or holes=1 (consistent in train 1 for affected shapes).
- **Pixel count preservation**: The pixel count for each individual shape in the input is identical to its corresponding shape in the output. This is consistent for all shapes, regardless of size (e.g., small 1-pixel shapes or larger 48-pixel shapes).
- **Bounding box dimensions preservation**: The width (max_x - min_x) and height (max_y - min_y) of each shape's bbox in the input are preserved exactly in the corresponding output shape. Orientation (horizontal vs. vertical) is also maintained—no swapping of width/height occurs. This holds for all shapes across all examples (e.g., 1x1 squares, 3x1 bars, 4x4 squares, 12x12 frames).

#### Positional Interactions (Component Positions → Collective Transformation)
- **Global position transformation**: The positions (bbox coordinates) of all main shapes interact collectively such that they undergo a consistent but unknown transformation in the output (e.g., shifts in min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y). This affects all shapes together, preserving relative structure but remapping absolute locations (e.g., many shapes shift toward lower x/y values, normalizing toward [0,0]). The exact rule (e.g., shift amount or mapping function) is unknown and cannot be explained from the data without further assumption, but it is applied uniformly to all preserved shapes in every example.
- **Peripheral small shapes omission**: Small shapes (typically 1-2 pixels, holes=0, located at high y-values like y=15-18 in inputs) consistently do not appear in outputs or are not transformed with the main set. This suggests they do not interact with the core components (possibly non-interacting labels), as their omission is consistent across all trains without affecting preserved shapes.

#### Non-Interactions (Noted for Completeness, as They Are Consistently Absent)
- No consistent interactions between specific colors (e.g., no Green → Pink effect observed in all cases, as colors differ across trains).
- No consistent effect from holes on other properties (e.g., holes=1 shapes do not reliably alter positions or pixels of other shapes across all examples).
- No consistent adjacency or overlap effects (bboxes do not show uniform touching/overlap patterns that transform predictably in every case).

No other obvious connections (e.g., pixel count → position shift, or specific shape silhouettes → movement) are consistent across all three examples.

[2025-10-02 11:33:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to automatically detect, crop, and pad the central "object" or pattern (a connected or dense region of non-zero values representing shapes like numbers or symbols) to produce a tight, square bounding box output, removing empty borders while preserving the relative structure and values of the pattern. The input grids are larger (e.g., 20x20) with sparse non-zero elements forming the puzzle elements, and the output should be a smaller square grid (size determined by the bounding box) with zero-padding if needed to square it.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main pattern is a contiguous or near-contiguous blob of non-zero cells (e.g., digits like 3,8,6 representing filled pixels), often vertically or horizontally elongated, surrounded by large empty (zero) borders; cropping must tightly bound this blob without including irrelevant empty space or extraneous small features.
 * Row_nonzero counts (number of positive cells per row) are key for identifying dense rows, but the max subarray must handle cases where the blob isn't perfectly contiguous—subtle gaps (e.g., single zero rows/columns within the blob) should not split it if they are minimal.
 * Column bounding (min_c, max_c) must be recomputed after row trimming to avoid including outlier columns from trimmed rows; width/height calculation affects square sizing, where size = max(height, width), and padding is symmetric (//2 flooring).
 * Trimming logic for excess height (when height > width) should prioritize removing rows with fewer non-zeros, but avoid over-trimming if it cuts into the core pattern; additional checks for rows with <2 non-zeros help remove thin borders but can erroneously trim meaningful sparse rows in the pattern.
 * Patterns may have internal zeros (e.g., holes in '8's), so non-zero density alone isn't perfect—consider connectivity (e.g., flood fill for blobs) to distinguish main object from noise like isolated cells.
 * Square padding must center the cropped region, with pad_top/bottom/left/right calculated correctly; outputs must match exact expected sizes and positions, including preserving all non-zero values without alteration.
 * Subtle elements: Some patterns have asymmetric shapes (e.g., train1 has a central '8' with '3' borders and '6' insert); small disconnected components (e.g., train2's border '5's) should be excluded if not part of the main blob; rotations or symmetries in borders (e.g., train3's checkerboard '4's) may mislead density-based cropping.
 * Fallbacks for empty or invalid ranges (e.g., start > end) produce all-zero grids, but this shouldn't trigger on valid inputs; n=20 is hardcoded, assuming fixed input size.
 * All examples show the main pattern is roughly centered but offset, requiring dynamic detection rather than fixed coordinates.

(Note: No custom types like PuzzleElement are present; the above are core helpers from the attempt. No object extraction function is provided, but one could be added via flood-fill for connected components to better identify the main blob over density alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses density-based row selection (max subarray on row_nonzero) which works partially for finding core row ranges but fails to handle gapped or asymmetric blobs, leading to incorrect start/end (e.g., train1 includes extra top/bottom empty rows).
 * Column trimming after row selection is recomputed correctly in theory, but initial min_c/max_c uses untrimmed rows, causing width overestimation; this results in oversized squares with misplaced padding.
 * Height trimming when height > width removes low-density rows from ends, which works for borders but over-trims in train1 (cuts '3' borders) and train2 (distorts '3' and '4' shapes); the <2 non-zero check exacerbates this by removing sparse but essential rows.
 * Padding calculation (symmetric with //2) is mostly correct but fails due to wrong crop dimensions, leading to off-center or oversized outputs (e.g., train1 generated 18x18 vs expected 13x13).
 * All training examples fail: Train1 generated includes full-width empty borders and misses tight crop around central pattern (e.g., generated has wide left/right zeros, expected trims to 13 cols with specific '3','8','6' layout); Train2 generated shifts '3's and '4's incorrectly (e.g., row3 has '3's in wrong positions vs expected, and excludes some border '5's); Train3 generated flips or misaligns the central '1','2' pattern and includes extra '4' borders (e.g., row2 has isolated '1' misplaced vs expected tighter crop).
 * max_subarray_indices is helpful for dense contiguous cases but broken for non-contiguous (e.g., doesn't bridge small gaps in row_nonzero); the fallback all-zero grid is unhelpful and triggers incorrectly.
 * No connectivity check (e.g., flood-fill for main blob) means small isolated non-zeros (e.g., train2's stray '5's) pollute bounds; this is essential but missing.
 * Hardcoded n=20 assumes fixed size, which works for these inputs but limits generality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to crop a partial or multiple disconnected regions incorrectly, resulting in a tall, narrow 19x19? grid with scattered small patterns (e.g., isolated '5's and '3's in rows 1-4 and 10-14, a small '4' block in rows 12, and bottom '5' lines) instead of a single tight square bounding the main central blob.
 * It includes irrelevant top isolated '3's and '5's (rows 1-4), skips the dense mid-section (rows 6-8 with '5's), and fragments the lower '3'/'4'/'5' pattern (rows 10-18), suggesting over-trimming or wrong row_start/end; expected should consolidate the main lower-central pattern (e.g., the '3'/'4'/'5' cluster around rows 10-18, cols 10-18) into a ~9x9 square, excluding top noise.
 * Padding seems absent or asymmetric (many full-zero rows/cols), and the output isn't squared properly; it looks like multiple small objects were extracted separately rather than one main one, missing the puzzle's focus on the primary connected/dense region.
 * This indicates the density trimming fails on multi-blob inputs with varying densities, over-relying on max subarray without blob merging.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the input is a rectangular grid of integers (likely representing colored or patterned "pixels" in a larger canvas with empty space), and the goal is to extract, crop, and reformat the core content into a centered square grid of appropriate size, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while removing or padding around extraneous empty areas or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The core content appears to be a single main "object" or patterned block (e.g., a figure made of numbers like 3,8,6 in example 1, or 5,3,4 in example 2), often surrounded by empty (zero) rows/columns or decorative borders; the output must isolate this block without including outer noise.
 * Bounding box calculation must be tight: min/max rows and columns should only encompass the non-zero elements of the main object, but examples show that not all non-empty rows are part of the main block (e.g., isolated single rows like the top/bottom in example 1's expected output are excluded or repositioned).
 * Padding is centered and uses zeros, but the target size N is the max of row/col spans of the cropped block; however, outputs are sometimes not perfectly square or have asymmetric padding, suggesting the crop might include subtle extensions or exclude parts.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have multiple disconnected components (e.g., border-like lines of 3's or 5's in examples 1-3), but only the central/dense object is kept; empty rows within the block are preserved if they are part of the pattern. Rotations, mirrors, or value changes are not involved—outputs retain exact values and relative positions.
 * Outputs are always square (or padded to square), but input sizes vary (e.g., 13x13 in ex1, 11x11 in ex2/3); test input seems 13x13 with a central pattern of 3's,4's,5's flanked by 5's on sides.
 * Considerations across attempts: Longest consecutive non-empty rows may over-include if there are thin border rows; bounding columns must ignore outliers. No evidence of object extraction beyond simple bounding—complex shapes (e.g., holes or blobs) aren't handled yet. Padding order (rows then columns) can cause misalignment if crop is rectangular.

```
(Helpful for horizontal centering; order with row padding matters.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on finding the longest consecutive non-empty row block, cropping to its bounding columns, and padding to a square— this correctly identifies a dense central area but over-includes border-like rows (e.g., top/bottom rows of 3's in ex1 generated but shifted/partial in expected).
 * What worked: Cropping and padding mechanics produce square outputs with preserved values; bounding columns tighten horizontal span well (e.g., reduces wide empty sides).
 * What didn't work: Row selection via longest consecutive block includes extraneous borders, leading to taller-than-needed crops (e.g., ex1 generated 13 rows with mismatched top/bottom vs. expected 13 but different positioning); padding centers incorrectly due to wrong initial crop, causing shifts (e.g., ex1 row 0 has 3's in cols 2,4 but expected has them in 3,10).
 * Ex1 differences: Generated has extra 3's in row0 col4, row2 has 8's/3's misplaced vs. expected (e.g., expected row2: 3 at col1,8 at3, etc.; unknown why but likely border inclusion); row10 in generated has 8's/3's but expected has different 8 pattern—crop too wide vertically.
 * Ex2 differences: Generated includes isolated row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] and pads to 11x11 but expected excludes/repositions it, has row1 as all zeros except 3, and different internal shifts (e.g., generated row4 has 3's at1-2 but expected row3 has 3's at3-5); seems to miss central density focus.
 * Ex3 differences: Generated crops to include alternating border rows (e.g., rows 1-2,9-10 as 4/0 patterns) but expected excludes them, focusing on inner 1/2 block (e.g., expected starts with border but crops inner 8 rows tightly); generated row7 has 1's misplaced vs. expected row6.
 * No object extraction beyond bounding—may need functions to detect/ignore thin borders or find "main blob" via connectivity/density.
 * Function `find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows` is partially helpful but broken for multi-component grids (over-inclusive); keep but refine.
 * Padding functions are helpful and correct in isolation but unhelpful when chained after bad crop.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it crops to a 13x13 square with heavy top/bottom padding (empty rows 0-2,10-12) and includes side 5's (cols 0-1,11-12) as part of the main block, but the central pattern (3's frame around 4's) seems shifted left/down compared to input density; input has 5's only on sides of rows 4,6,8 but generated embeds them fully, suggesting over-cropping horizontally/vertically without excluding borders.
 * It misses subtlety of isolating the inner 3/4 pattern (likely the "object") while perhaps treating side 5's as noise; output has symmetric padding but the embedded block is 7 rows high (3-9) vs. input's scattered rows, indicating longest-block logic grabbed too much vertically but not centered properly.
 * To handle test: Need better main-block detection (e.g., ignore side columns with uniform 5's) and tighter vertical crop to rows 3-9, padding to ~9x9 or max span, then re-pad to square—current output looks like a bloated version of the input without true extraction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to process a square grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like values for shapes or images) by identifying and extracting the "main" non-zero connected component (object), cropping to its tight bounding box, and padding it to a square while preserving the original values and structure. The challenge involves correctly defining connectivity (8-connected), selecting the right component (central and largest), handling borders/frames that might connect to or surround the main object, and ensuring the extraction matches subtle positional details without introducing artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connectivity for components (diagonal neighbors count as connected), as non-zero cells can touch diagonally to form a single object.
 * The "main" component is typically the one closest to the grid center (measured by bounding box center distance to grid center), with ties broken by size (largest area); ignore small or peripheral components like borders or noise.
 * Borders or frames (e.g., repeating patterns of 3's or 4's around the edges) often form separate components or might connect to the main object, but they should be excluded—do not include them in the extraction unless they are part of the central shape.
 * After extracting the subgrid via bounding box, pad to the smallest square that fits (side length = max(height, width of subgrid)), centering the content with zeros; padding must be symmetric where possible but can be uneven if dimensions require it.
 * Grids may have multiple distinct values (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6 for object parts, 4/1/2 for shapes), but treat all non-zero as connectable regardless of value—do not segment by value.
 * Subtle positional mismatches occur frequently: e.g., in rotations or irregular shapes, the bounding box might shift, causing rows/columns to align differently; ensure the extracted subgrid retains exact relative positions.
 * Handle empty or single-cell cases gracefully (return zero-padded grid if no component).
 * Grids are always square input (n x n), but output must also be square (possibly smaller effective size after padding).
 * Easy to miss: Components might not be fully enclosed; test for cases where the main object touches the border, requiring careful separation; also, center calculation uses floating-point bounding box midpoint, so use precise distance formula.
 * Padding centers the subgrid, so calculate top/left pads as floor((n - dim)/2), with remainder on bottom/right.
 * Visually, outputs should "zoom in" on the central irregular shape, removing outer frames, but preserving internal details like holes or protrusions (e.g., isolated 6's or 8's).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implements 8-connected DFS for components, bounding box calculation, central selection with distance tiebreaker, subgrid extraction, and centered zero-padding—these are solid building blocks and worked for basic structure but failed to isolate the main object properly.
 * What worked: Component detection accurately finds non-zero groups (e.g., in example 1, it grabs a large central blob with 8's and 6's); padding centers content without distortion; handles empty cases by returning zero grid.
 * What didn't work: In all training examples, it incorrectly includes or excludes parts of the main object due to over-merging with borders (e.g., in example 1, generated includes extra 3's on left/top as part of the component, shifting the entire shape right/down compared to expected, where top row has 3's more centered and bottom has isolated 3's in columns 6-7; differences include row 0: generated [0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]—extra 3's and misaligned; row 2: generated has 8's starting earlier; row 10: generated [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,3,0]—missing 8's in positions 2-5, extra in 9; unknown why bounding box expanded to include border 3's, perhaps partial connectivity).
 * In example 2, generated mismatches inner 3's and 4's positions (e.g., row 1: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—3 shifted right; row 3: generated [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—extra 3's in cols 1-2, missing in 8; row 4: generated has 3's in 2 and 8 vs expected 3's in 1-2; likely selected a component that merged border 5's incorrectly with inner shapes).
 * In example 3, generated treats the 4's frame as part of or adjacent to the central 1/2 component, resulting in a larger bounding box that includes the entire frame (e.g., row 0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—starts with 4 instead of 0, and pattern is shifted; row 2: generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] includes frame 4's at ends vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] which crops tighter, starting inner content earlier; row 5: generated [0,4,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,4] vs expected [4,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,4,0]—rotated or flipped feel, with 4's misplaced; unknown exact cause, but likely frame 4's form a connected ring around the center, pulling the bounding box outward).
 * Overall, the attempt overestimates the main component by including border-connected cells, leading to shifted/wider outputs; selection metric works but needs refinement to explicitly exclude border-like components (e.g., those touching edges).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and mostly correct, though the full program() integrates them poorly for border separation; do not discard, but enhance select_main_component to penalize edge-touching components.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output [[5,5],[0,0]] appears correct at first glance for a tiny 2x2 input grid (assuming input is [[5,5],[0,0]]), as the non-zero cells [5,5] in row 0 form a connected component (side-by-side, 8-connected), bounding box is row 0 col 0-1, extraction is [[5,5]], padding to 2x2 adds [0,0] below, matching exactly—no border issues here since it's small and no extraneous components.
 * However, it only "makes sense" if the puzzle rules apply uniformly; for larger cases, this simple pass doesn't demonstrate handling of the core subtlety (border exclusion), so it might coincidentally work but not generalize—watch for tests with frames around small objects, where it could wrongly include them and shift the [5,5] row.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify and extract the primary "image" or figure from a sparse grid of positive integers (likely representing colored pixels or segments of a logo/object), crop it to a tight bounding box (possibly allowing limited gaps for incomplete rows/columns), pad it to a centered square of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, and output the result as a square grid. The extraction must preserve the relative positions and values of the non-zero elements while ignoring empty borders and disconnected noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid represents a 2D image with 0s as background/empty and positive integers as filled pixels of different "colors" or types (e.g., 3,5,6,8 in train1; 3,4,5 in train2; 1,2,4 in train3), and the output must retain these exact values without alteration.
 * Cropping should focus on the densest or most continuous block of non-zeros, treating the grid as potentially containing a single main object with possible thin gaps (e.g., single empty rows/columns might be tolerated, but larger gaps separate components).
 * Padding must be even (centered) on all sides to form a square, using 0s, but the square size is max(cropped_height, cropped_width), not the original grid size—subtly, this can lead to oversized outputs if cropping is loose.
 * Disconnected components (e.g., separate blobs of the same or different numbers) should likely be ignored except for the main/largest one; the test input has multiple scattered clusters (5's in rows 6-7 and 17-19; 3's and 4 in rows 9-15), suggesting the program must select the primary figure, not union all.
 * Row/column selection prioritizes maximum "density" (e.g., sum of non-zeros or count of non-empty lines), but with gap tolerance: train1 expected allows some irregularity (e.g., partial rows at top/bottom), while generated includes extras like full empty rows.
 * Fallback bounding box logic (min-max non-zero positions) is sometimes needed if no perfect contiguous subarray exists, but it must not include large empty margins.
 * Outputs are square but sized to the cropped content (e.g., train2 expected is 10x10, not 12x12), implying tight cropping is key; loose cropping bloats the square unnecessarily.
 * Subtle asymmetry in expected outputs: train1 expected has uneven padding (e.g., more empty space on right/bottom), but generated is more symmetric yet includes unwanted elements (e.g., extra 3's in row0/col2).
 * Rotation, mirroring, or reordering is not needed—preserve original orientation and positions relative to crop.
 * Edge cases: fully disconnected grids (like test) require selecting the largest/densest component; all-zero grids should output empty square of original size? But program returns n x n zeros, which may be correct.
 * Non-zero counts per row/column are useful metrics, but "sum of values" vs. "count of non-zeros" matters—program uses count, but if values represent thickness, sum might be better (unknown, but generated mismatches suggest count is insufficient).
 * Grids can be non-square originally, but outputs are always square; n varies (13 in train1, 12 in train2/3, 20 in test).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies the need for density-based cropping using non-zero counts per row/column and gap-tolerant subarray search, which partially worked for finding approximate bounds in contiguous cases but failed due to incorrect gap tolerances (e.g., max_gap=1 for rows included extra sparse rows in train1, leading to 14x14 instead of 13x13).
 * Cropping logic for columns used max_gap=0 (strict contiguous), with fallback to min-max bounding, but this over-included sparse columns in train1 (e.g., generated has extra 0's and shifted 3's on left/right) and failed to isolate the main figure in train2/3 (generated 12x12 includes borders, expected 10x10 crops tighter).
 * Padding to max(h,w) with centered 0's is correct in principle but produced oversized/inaccurate squares because upstream cropping was loose; e.g., train1 generated includes unwanted top/bottom rows with isolated 3's, mismatching expected's tighter crop (e.g., expected row0 has isolated 3's but different positions).
 * For train1, generated mismatched blob shapes: e.g., row2 has [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,...] vs. expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why, possibly due to row selection including row1 (all 3's) but shifting columns wrong; also added extra bottom empty row.
 * For train2, generated included full empty borders (12x12) and misplaced elements (e.g., row1 [0,5,0,5,...] vs. expected starting directly with [5,0,5,...] in a 10x10 crop), failing to exclude outer empties and select the inner 3/4/5 figure tightly; fallback column logic didn't trigger properly.
 * For train3, similar issue: generated 12x12 with borders, mismatching expected 10x10 crop (e.g., generated row2 [0,0,4,0,4,...] includes extras vs. expected direct [0,4,0,4,...]); strict column gap=0 excluded valid irregular parts like scattered 1's/2's.
 * No object extraction function was present, but one could be added to find connected components (e.g., via flood-fill on non-zeros) to isolate the main blob, as density alone misses disconnected noise.
 * The max_subarray function is helpful and mostly correct but needs tunable gaps (e.g., try 0-2) and perhaps sum-of-values instead of count for density.
 * compute_row_nonzero is useful and correct, but a column version is implied and works partially.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt—all are relevant, but the overall program lacks component selection, leading to inclusion of noise.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a 20x20 grid (original size) with only a small cropped/padded region of 3's,4's,5's in the top-leftish area (rows ~6-14, cols ~7-12), but ignores lower 5's (rows 17-19) and pads excessively with zeros everywhere else, resulting in a mostly empty grid that doesn't isolate a single main figure.
 * Compared to input, it captured the middle 3/4 cluster but missed the top 5's (rows 6-7) and bottom 5's (rows 17-19), suggesting the row selection with max_gap=1 picked only one component; expected likely needs to select the largest/densest (the 3/4 block) and crop tightly to ~6x6 or so, padded to square without the full 20x20 bloat.
 * The output makes partial sense as a cropped attempt but is incorrect because it doesn't form a compact square representation of the primary content—it's diluted by huge zero padding, and the positioned content (e.g., 5's in rows 6-7 of output match input's top 5's? Wait, no—output rows 6-7 have 5's in cols 7-11, matching input row6-7, but then jumps to 3's in row9-15, indicating it unioned non-contiguous rows, which bloated h=10+ but with gaps, violating gap tolerance.
 * To handle test, must add connected component analysis to pick one main object (likely the densest 3/4 block in rows9-15, cols6-13), crop tightly (h~7, w~8, pad to 8x8), excluding scattered 5's as noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to clean up a grid by isolating the core pattern or "object" (e.g., letters, shapes, or symbols formed by non-zero cells) while removing surrounding noise, borders, or extraneous connected elements, then cropping tightly and padding to a centered square if needed. The process emphasizes distinguishing the main blob from decorative or irregular borders that are often connected but should be excluded to match the expected clean, minimal representations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids often have outer borders (e.g., 3's in example 1, 5's in example 2, 4's in example 3) that form connected components of non-zero cells but are noise; the main pattern is typically an inner, denser, or more structured blob that may not be the absolute largest component.
 * Use 8-connectivity for components to capture diagonal connections in patterns like letters or shapes, but avoid merging borders with the core if they touch—subtlety is detecting "frame-like" structures vs. solid fills.
 * Cropping must be to the tight bounding box of the main component only, preserving internal zeros (holes or gaps) but excluding isolated noise within the crop if it's not part of the pattern.
 * Padding to square uses the max dimension, centered symmetrically, with zeros; however, if the input is already square-like, no padding occurs, but the core issue is often pre-padding cleanup.
 * Expected outputs show irregular borders adjusted (e.g., some border cells zeroed out or shifted), suggesting rules like removing single-cell protrusions, handling asymmetric noise, or prioritizing components by density/shape over size.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have internal components (e.g., holes with 0's inside non-zeros) that must stay; borders may not fully enclose (e.g., gaps in test input); values like 3,4,5,6,8 represent different "inks" but connectivity is by non-zero regardless of value.
 * All non-zero cells are treated equally for connectivity, but outputs preserve original values—don't normalize or change them.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return empty; small isolated cells are noise; multiple components require selecting the "primary" one (not always largest, as borders can be bigger).
 * Considerations across attempts: Flood fill/DFS is reliable for components but needs filtering (e.g., by size threshold, perimeter-to-area ratio for "frame" detection, or excluding components touching grid edges).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented connected components, bounding box cropping, and centered square padding, which worked for basic structure preservation and output formatting (e.g., kept internal values and zeros intact).
 * What didn't work: Relied on the largest component, which included borders/noise (e.g., full 3-border in train 1 generated vs. expected irregular/partial border with some 0's and shifted positions; similar for 5-borders in train 2 and 4-borders in train 3), leading to oversized crops that retained unwanted elements.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 3's in top/bottom rows (e.g., full row of 3's in row 1/11 vs. expected sparse 3's and 0's); internal 8's and 6's shifted or added erroneously (e.g., row 2 has 8's where expected has 0's); bottom row has misplaced 3's.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated includes border 5's bleeding into inner pattern (e.g., row 3 has 3's in cols 1-2 where expected has 0's; row 4 has extra 3's and missing 4's in positions); row 1 has 3 where expected has all 0's except end.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated rotates or includes border as part of pattern (e.g., row 0 starts with 4's alternating vs. expected starting with 0; inner 1's and 2's misplaced, like row 2 has extra 0's and 1's shifted); overall looks like border merged without exclusion.
 * Function `get_largest_component` is broken/not helpful as-is (always picks size-max, ignoring border-like components; suggest filtering by not touching edges or by shape metrics).
 * Padding functions (e.g., `calculate_vertical_padding`, `apply_padding`) are helpful and correct but underutilized since crops are too large, resulting in no/minimal padding.
 * `crop_to_bounds` preserves isolated cells within bounds (good), but since wrong component is chosen, it includes noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output matches the input grid exactly (7x7 with irregular 3/4 border and inner pattern), which does not look correct because prior training examples show the need for cleanup—likely the expected output should exclude or zero out the incomplete border (e.g., top-left 3's in rows 0-1 might be noise, inner 4 as main, with tighter crop/pad to square without edge protrusions like row 6's lone 3).
 * It makes sense as a "no-op" from the program's logic (largest component spans nearly whole grid, bounding box is full 7x7, no padding needed), but fails the puzzle's intent since borders aren't removed, leading to unclean pattern (e.g., asymmetric 0's and 3's around the central 4 and lines).
 * To handle test: Program needs border exclusion (e.g., ignore components touching all four edges) to crop just the inner cross-like pattern with 4, padding to square if height/width differ after cleanup.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely pixel art or figure extraction) where the task is to identify, isolate, and normalize the primary "object" or figure from a larger scene, typically by extracting a connected region of non-zero cells, cropping to its bounding box, resizing/padding to a square grid, and possibly applying transformations like rotation or alignment to match a canonical orientation. The output must exactly replicate specific expected layouts, which appear to emphasize precise positioning, exclusion of background or border elements, and correct handling of multiple components or numbers (e.g., 3 as borders, 6/8 as inner shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use numbers (e.g., 3 for borders/frames, 6/8/4/1/2 for object parts) to represent distinct visual elements; zeros are empty space, and connectivity defines "objects," but 8-connectivity (diagonals) may over-connect borders or backgrounds, leading to inclusion of unwanted areas.
 * The "main" object is often the largest connected component of non-zeros, but it must exclude persistent borders/frames (e.g., 3's or 4's that form enclosures) and focus on inner irregular shapes; subtle: borders may be connected but should be omitted or treated separately to avoid bloating the bounding box.
 * Cropping uses the tight bounding box (min/max row/col), then pads to the max side length square with zeros, but placement must be top-left aligned in the new grid—however, expected outputs show shifts, rotations (e.g., 90-degree turns), or flips to "upright" the figure, suggesting orientation normalization based on asymmetry (e.g., making protrusions point down or centering).
 * Padding and alignment are critical: new grid is square, but expected may have uneven padding (e.g., more zeros on top/bottom) to match visual centering or specific offsets; easy to miss that the entire output must be exactly the expected size and positions, not just the shape.
 * Multiple components exist (e.g., inner blobs of different numbers like 6 and 8 may be separate but part of one "object" if visually cohesive); the code merges them if connected, but expected sometimes separates or reorients independently.
 * Subtle elements: In enclosed scenes (e.g., train1/3), the main object is inside a frame—code includes frame if connected; rotation/flip is needed if input is sideways (e.g., train3 generated vs. expected shows row/col swap like a transpose or 90-degree clockwise rotation). Handle varying grid sizes (10x13, 10x10, 7x7) by outputting square but preserving relative positions. Non-zero cells must retain exact values; zeros must match precisely, including sparse placements.
 * Across attempts: No input grids provided, so infer from outputs—expected often has "cleaner" or reoriented inner shapes with borders detached; test case likely a simple shape (e.g., cross or letter-like with 3's) that needs similar extraction/rotation. Avoid over-cropping (losing protrusions) or under-padding (mismatched sizes).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it correctly identifies non-zero positions and uses connected components to extract regions, which works for isolating potential objects but fails on all trainings due to including connected borders/frames as part of the main component (e.g., train1/3 bloat the shape with 3's/4's).
 * What worked: Bounding box cropping and square padding logic produces a normalized size/output; component extraction via stack/visited avoids revisits and handles sparse grids well.
 * What didn't work: 8-connectivity merges inner objects with enclosing borders (e.g., train1 generated includes extra 3's in rows 1/3/13 vs. expected's sparser top/bottom; train3 generated has border rows swapped vs. expected, suggesting no rotation applied); largest component assumption fails when borders are biggest (e.g., train2 generated crops to 10x10 but misplaces 5's/3's/4's, losing some zeros and connections).
 * Train1: Generated has denser 3's/8's/6's with incorrect top row [0,0,3,0,3,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,...] (extra 3's, wrong offsets); bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs. expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (misaligned protrusions); inner rows like row3 [3,3,8,8,0,...] vs. [0,3,0,8,0,...] show over-connected 3's/8's, possibly from diagonal links.
 * Train2: Generated starts with [0,0,5,0,5,5,...] but expected [5,0,5,0,5,5,...] (missing leading 5's, wrong alignment); row4 [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...] (extra 3's, 4's shifted); overall shape is cropped but rotated/misplaced, e.g., 5's frame not fully enclosed as in expected.
 * Train3: Generated border alternates starting with 4 in col0 row0 vs. expected starting with 0 (appears as 90-degree rotation or transpose needed); inner [4,0,0,0,0,1,...] vs. [0,4,0,1,1,...] shows slight shifts in 1's/2's positions, likely from including full connected 4's border.
 * find_connected_components is helpful but broken for this puzzle due to 8-connectivity (try 4-connectivity: only [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)] to detach diagonals); positions extraction is solid and reusable.
 * No other functions provided; the main program is relevant but incomplete (add rotation, e.g., check orientations and rotate grid 90/180/270 degrees to match expected asymmetry).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it appears to be a tight crop of a 3's-only shape (forming a sort of "E" or asymmetric cross in 7x7) with top-left alignment and bottom protrusion [0,0,0,0,3,0,0], but without input grid, it likely includes unwanted connected elements or fails orientation like in trainings (e.g., if input has a rotated figure or border, this misses rotation/centering, leading to mismatched positions). It makes sense as a cropped connected component of 3's but not as the full puzzle solution, since trainings show expected outputs require detaching inners, adding sparse zeros, or reorienting—here, the dense 3's block and uneven padding (e.g., row7 has isolated 3's) probably doesn't match an "upright" canonical form, and size (7x7) assumes max side without verification against expected subtlety like frame exclusion.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean up a colored grid (likely representing a segmented image or diagram) by identifying and removing small or peripheral connected components (blobs of the same integer value), then trimming empty borders to create a minimal bounding box, and finally padding to a square shape while preserving the core structure of larger components. The expected outputs suggest a focus on retaining main "objects" or "shapes" (e.g., letters, symbols, or diagrams formed by colored regions) while eliminating noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts, especially those in peripheral or high-row positions, to match a compact, cleaned representation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right) and defined by matching integer values (colors like 3,5,6,8); size is counted by number of cells, and small ones (size <=2) should be omitted only if they are "peripheral" – specifically, those with minimum row index >=15 (assuming row 0 is top, so "high y" means lower rows? Wait, code uses min_r_comp >=15, but examples suggest top rows are low indices; this may be inverted or grid-specific).
 * Omission/resetting: After identifying a small component, reflood it with 0s using the original grid to avoid visited array issues, but ensure it doesn't accidentally affect larger components of the same color.
 * Trimming: Extract the minimal bounding box of non-zero cells post-omission; if no non-zeros remain, return empty; subtleties include handling uneven shapes (e.g., examples show irregular blobs like letters 'E' or 'F' in colors).
 * Padding: Add zero rows/columns only on right and bottom to reach max(h,w) side length; preserve top-left alignment.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have "noise" like isolated 1-2 cell blobs in borders or specific rows (e.g., example 1 has stray 3's in top/bottom rows to remove); colors represent distinct objects (don't merge across colors); no holes mentioned, but examples have enclosed areas (e.g., 6's might form loops); row indexing matters – example 1 expected removes top-left 3's but keeps some bottom ones, suggesting peripheral means outer edges or specific row thresholds; example 3 shows heavy trimming needed from a sparse 15x15 to 10x10, implying removal of all but central multi-color structure; test input has vertical stacks of 5's/3's separated by empty rows, suggesting need to remove isolated small groups and connect or preserve main horizontal structures.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connections; handle empty grids gracefully; post-trim grid may not be square initially, but padding ensures it; potential over-removal (e.g., keeping size=3+ even if peripheral); row threshold >=15 seems arbitrary/misapplied (example 1 has rows up to 12, so maybe threshold is wrong or rows are bottom-up).
 * Other considerations: Examples suggest puzzle is about "object extraction" from noisy scans (e.g., OCR-like cleanup); test input has long empty rows/columns, so trimming must be aggressive; colors like 4/6 may form "filled" shapes, while 3/5/8 are outlines; don't assume square input – outputs vary (13x13, 10x10, 10x10).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt shown, composing omission, trim, and pad; it partially understands component detection and cleanup but fails all trainings due to incomplete removal (e.g., keeps some small 3's in ex1 top row [positions 2 and 4 in gen vs expected only at 3 and 10]; ex1 row2 starts with [3,3,...] vs expected [0,3,...], suggesting didn't remove left-peripheral size=2 blob; ex1 bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] – partial removal but wrong positions).
 * Ex2: Generated keeps extra 3's in row3 [0,3,3,0,...] vs expected [0,0,3,0,...]; row4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0] – mismatches in 3/4 placement, likely didn't remove small isolated 3's or mis-trimmed; overall shape is close but blob connectivity wrong (e.g., 4's not fully filled).
 * Ex3: Generated retains full 15x15 with sparse top/bottom (e.g., isolated 1's/4's at edges) vs expected compact 10x10 central structure; omission didn't trigger (components larger? or threshold >=15 skips all since grid is 15 rows, min_r=0 <15); trim/pad ineffective as bounding box includes empties.
 * Function `omit_peripheral_small_components` is helpful but broken: row threshold too high (skips removals in small grids); reset uses original g but may miss if visited interferes; doesn't handle "peripheral" as edge-distance (e.g., cols 0 or rows 0/last).
 * `trim_empty_borders` is helpful and correct in logic but fails if upstream has unremoved noise expanding bounds.
 * `pad_to_square` is helpful and correct but irrelevant if prior steps wrong.
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., no function to list all components by size/color/min-max bounds); attempt misses that some "small" might be size>2 if peripheral, or need to remove based on position not just size/row.
 * General: No handling of multi-color interactions (e.g., ex1 has 3 as background/outline?); attempt assumes no holes but ex1/2 have potential enclosed 0's in 6/4.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a sparse 19x19 grid retaining isolated small stacks (e.g., vertical 5's in cols 3-4 rows 0-4, horizontal 5's in rows 7-8 cols 11-15, 3's in row10 cols11-12 and row15 col13) without removal, and long empty rows/columns (e.g., rows 5-6,9,16-18 all zero), suggesting omission didn't trigger (components size=3+? or threshold issue) and trim failed to crop to central multi-color structure around rows10-15 cols10-18 (3's/4's/5's forming shapes); expected should be a trimmed square (likely ~8x10 or similar) with main blobs (e.g., 3's as bars, 5's as borders, 4 as filler) compacted, removing top isolated 5's/3's and bottom strays; this looks like no effective cleanup, preserving noise.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing grid-based visual representations (likely pixel art or shape drawings with numbered "colors" or labels) to isolate and transform the main object or shape, such as cropping to a bounding box and padding to a square while preserving the internal structure. The goal appears to be extracting a central or primary visual element, possibly removing or adjusting borders/noise, but the current approach over-connects disparate elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use numbers (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6/4/1/2 for internal shapes) to represent distinct visual elements; connectivity should likely be based on SAME value (4-connected or 8-connected) rather than any non-zero, as different numbers form separate "objects" (e.g., border vs. filled shapes).
 * The "main" object may not be the absolute largest component by cell count; it could be the largest SAME-value component, or one that forms a coherent shape (e.g., ignoring thin borders or noise); in examples, borders (3s or 4s/5s) seem partially retained but adjusted.
 * Bounding box extraction must tightly fit the selected component without including extraneous zeros or adjacent but unrelated numbers; padding to square should center the content but examples show irregular padding or shifts (e.g., uneven top/bottom rows).
 * Subtleties include handling disconnected parts of the same number (e.g., if border has gaps, it might split into multiple components); possible need to merge or select specific components (e.g., non-border shapes); outputs preserve number values but rearrange or omit parts, suggesting not pure cropping but transformation (e.g., removing outer frame or normalizing orientation).
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs are not always square-padded identically (e.g., train 1 expected has asymmetric 3s in top/bottom rows); grids may have implicit backgrounds (0s) that need trimming precisely; test input has a near-symmetric 3-frame with central 4, but output might need to isolate the 4 or adjust the frame.
 * Consider orientation/rotation: Train 3 expected swaps row patterns from generated, suggesting possible need to normalize (e.g., rotate to match a standard top-left).
 * All examples show multi-object scenes (border + internals); solution must identify "primary" via rules like size, position (central), or type (non-border).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_eight_neighbors(r: int, c: int, n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    neighbors = []
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:
            neighbors.append((nr, nc))
    return neighbors
```
(This 8-way neighbor function is useful for component detection if 8-connectivity is needed; could modify for 4-way by removing diagonals.)

```python
def find_all_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    visited = set()
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != 0 and (i, j) not in visited:
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    if (cr, cc) in visited:
                        continue
                    visited.add((cr, cc))
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_eight_neighbors(cr, cc, n):
                        if g[nr][nc] != 0 and (nr, nc) not in visited:  # Note: Change to g[nr][nc] == g[cr][cc] for same-value components
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder is helpful for extracting objects but currently broken for this puzzle as it connects any non-zero; fix by adding same-value check to isolate shapes like 8s vs. 6s.)

```python
def get_bounding_box(component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    min_r = min(r for r, c in component)
    max_r = max(r for r, c in component)
    min_c = min(c for r, c in component)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in component)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c

def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[min_c : max_c + 1] for row in g[min_r : max_r + 1]]

def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return []
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    n = max(h, w)
    pad_top = (n - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = n - h - pad_top
    pad_left = (n - w) // 2
    pad_right = n - w - pad_left
    padded = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            padded[pad_top + i][pad_left + j] = grid[i][j]
    return padded
```
(Bounding box, subgrid extraction, and centered square padding are helpful and mostly correct for cropping/isolating; they work well if fed the right component, but current selection fails.)

```python
def select_largest_component(components: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not components:
        return []
    return max(components, key=len)
```
(This selector is helpful but incomplete; may need to filter by value (e.g., ignore border number like 3) or position (e.g., central component) instead of just size.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses 8-connected components on any non-zero cells, which merges borders (e.g., 3s) with internals (e.g., 8s/6s), leading to oversized bounding boxes that include unwanted parts; this fails all training examples by producing bloated or misaligned outputs.
 * Train 1: Generated includes full border+internals in bounding box, resulting in mismatched positions (e.g., row 0 has 3 at col 2/4 vs. expected col 3/10; row 2 has extra 3s and wrong 8 placements; bottom row has scattered 0s vs. expected 3s at col 5/7); padding centers but doesn't match expected asymmetries (unknown why, possibly due to over-inclusion).
 * Train 2: Generated mishandles internal shapes (e.g., row 3 has 3s/4s in wrong spots like extra 3 at col1/2 vs. expected 0s; row 4 has 5 at col0 but expected 5 at col0 with shifted 3s; overall, border 5s are preserved but internals like 3s/4s are distorted, likely from merged components).
 * Train 3: Generated outputs the full grid with border 4s and internals 1/2, but expected reorders rows (e.g., starts with [0,4,0,...] vs. generated [4,0,4,...], suggesting rotation or row swap needed; internals like 2s are in wrong bounding box, e.g., row4 has 1 at col2 vs. expected different; border seems flipped).
 * Function `find_all_components` is broken for this puzzle (connects different numbers; don't use as-is; modify for same-value).
 * Function `select_largest_component` is not helpful alone (picks overall largest, which is often the border, but puzzle may want internal shapes; consider alternatives like max per value).
 * No omission of small/noise components (e.g., single 4s); no handling for multiple same-value components (e.g., split borders).
 * Padding works but interacts badly with wrong bounding boxes, causing shifts (e.g., train 1 bottom row misalignment).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to crop/pad a near-full view of the input (7x7 frame of 3s with central 4 at row3 col3), but it includes the entire border without isolation, resulting in a symmetric frame that retains all non-zeros; this does not look correct because training examples suggest internals (like the 4) should be emphasized or border adjusted (e.g., gaps filled or border trimmed), and the output has redundant 0s at bottom-right that might need tightening.
 * Compared to input, output adds no major changes but fails to "extract" (e.g., if puzzle wants just the 4 shape padded, this overincludes 3s; if border is noise, it should be removed); asymmetries in input (e.g., bottom row 0s) are preserved but may need normalization.
 * Does not match expected patterns from training (e.g., no row swaps or value-specific cropping); likely incorrect as it would fail similarly to train cases by merging 3s+4 into one component.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored pixels (represented by integers like 3, 5, 6, 8) where the task is to identify and extract the "main" object—likely a composite shape formed by nearby connected components of the same or different colors—then rotate it to a canonical orientation (e.g., upright) based on color cues, and output the rotated grid with the object centered or aligned in a minimal bounding box, omitting extraneous pixels or noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent pixels of the exact same color; different colors do not connect directly, but "meta-components" group nearby components (via centroid distance) to form composite objects.
 * The "main" object is the largest meta-component by total pixel count, ignoring smaller isolated blobs or noise (e.g., stray pixels or small groups).
 * Rotation is determined by specific "cue" colors in the main object: presence of 5 triggers clockwise (cw) rotation, 1 triggers counterclockwise (ccw), otherwise default to 180-degree rotation; this seems to "unrotate" the object based on asymmetric markers.
 * After extraction, pixels are shifted relative to the aggregate bounding box (bbox) minimums, rotated in the new orientation (which may swap height/width for 90-degree rotations), and placed in a new grid of the rotated dimensions; zeros fill the rest, but the output should match the expected shape, size, and positioning exactly.
 * Subtleties include: threshold for meta-grouping (e.g., 5.5 units via Euclidean distance on centroids) must be tuned to capture intended composites without merging unrelated parts; bbox computation uses min/max rows/columns across grouped components; rotations must handle coordinate transformations precisely (e.g., cw: new_row = old_col, new_col = new_width-1 - old_row_offset) to avoid off-by-one errors or flipped placements.
 * Outputs are lists of lists (rows), with exact dimensions and pixel placements matching expectations; extraneous rows/columns of zeros or misaligned shapes indicate failure.
 * Noise omission is key—small components (e.g., single pixels or tiny blobs) should be ignored unless part of the main meta-group.
 * Color sets drive decisions but only for rotation; all colors in the main group are preserved post-rotation.
 * Edge cases: rotated grids may change aspect ratio (h↔w for cw/ccw); 180-degree keeps dimensions but inverts positions; if no main object, return minimal empty grid.
 * Potential pitfalls: centroid approximation via bbox center may inaccurately group if shapes are irregular; stack-based flood fill must mark visited correctly to avoid infinite loops or missed pixels.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies connected components and meta-grouping via proximity, which works well for composite objects (as seen in training example 3 passing).
 * Rotation detection via color cues (5 for cw, 1 for ccw, else 180) is a core principle that aligns with puzzle asymmetry, but fails when cues are absent or misdetected (e.g., training 1 defaults to 180 but placements are off).
 * Extraction of largest meta-component by pixel count effectively omits noise in cases like training 3, but in training 1, it includes too much or misaligns the bbox, leading to partial shape matches.
 * Threshold of 5.5 for meta-grouping works for some densities (training 3) but may be too loose/tight for others, causing over-merging or under-grouping (e.g., training 2 scatters pixels instead of compacting).
 * Centroid-based bbox centers approximate well for symmetric blobs but may err on irregular shapes, contributing to incorrect distances in training 1 and 2.
 * Pixel extraction and rotation application preserve colors and positions mostly correctly, but coordinate transforms have off-by-one or inversion issues (e.g., training 1 generated first row [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]—3's shifted right; last row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—misplaced and wrong count).
 * In training 2, generated a sparse 15x15-ish grid with isolated pixels (e.g., row 0: [0,3,0,0,...]; row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]) vs compact 10x10 expected (e.g., row 0: [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5])—failed to group/rotate into dense shape, possibly due to poor meta-detection or wrong rotation (colors include 5, so cw attempted but dimensions wrong: generated tall/thin vs expected square-ish).
 * Training 1 mismatches blob shapes in rows 0,1,6,12 (unknown reason—possibly bbox shift or rotation not inverting fully; 3's and 6's positions swapped or flipped incorrectly).
 * Training 2 omits consolidation, leaving unrotated fragments (e.g., 5's and 3's not aligned into expected borders).
 * The main program orchestrates well but bbox computation and rotation placement need tighter offset handling (e.g., no padding added; exact min_r/min_c subtraction).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all provided are relevant, though rotation may need validation for edge cases like zero-height/width.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x10 grid with vertical 5's on the left (rows 1-2,4-9), horizontal 3's in the middle forming a shape with a 4 inset (row 6 col 6), and bottom 3's— it looks like a partial frame or letter-like shape, but density feels low (many zeros) and asymmetric, suggesting incomplete grouping or wrong rotation.
 * It does not look fully correct: the 5's form a sparse column, 3's a loose blob with 4 inside, but if the puzzle expects a rotated/aligned compact object (e.g., cw since 5 present), this may be pre-rotation or mis-extracted; expected likely denser (like training 2's compact form) with 5's repositioned to borders, 4 centered, and no stray zeros in a minimal bbox.
 * Differences from intuition: positions like 4 at (6,6) seem arbitrary; if cw rotation was applied, 5's should map horizontally—current verticality suggests either no rotation triggered or transform failed; overall, it resembles unprocessed input more than a "solved" upright object, missing the consolidation seen in correct training 3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious and consistent interactions/connections observed **in every example**. These are limited to properties and components that show clear, direct relationships (e.g., preservation or collective effect) across all train cases. No high-level solving or assumptions about the overall puzzle are included. Connections that vary by color, are not present in all examples, or cannot be directly linked (e.g., specific shape-to-shape overlaps, since bboxes do not consistently indicate adjacency or containment across all cases) are excluded. If a potential connection (like positional transformation) cannot be fully explained without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

#### Preserved Properties (Direct Link: Input Property → Output Property for Corresponding Shapes)
- **Color preservation**: Every shape's color in the input directly corresponds to a shape of the same color in the output, with no color changes or new colors introduced for matching components. This holds for all colors present (e.g., Maroon/Pink/Green in train 1, Orange/Green/Yellow in train 2, Blue/Yellow/Red in train 3).
- **Holes preservation**: The number of holes (holes count) for each individual shape in the input is identical to its corresponding shape in the output. This applies universally, whether holes=0 (consistent in trains 2 and 3) or holes=1 (consistent in train 1 for affected shapes).
- **Pixel count preservation**: The pixel count for each individual shape in the input is identical to its corresponding shape in the output. This is consistent for all shapes, regardless of size (e.g., small 1-pixel shapes or larger 48-pixel shapes).
- **Bounding box dimensions preservation**: The width (max_x - min_x) and height (max_y - min_y) of each shape's bbox in the input are preserved exactly in the corresponding output shape. Orientation (horizontal vs. vertical) is also maintained—no swapping of width/height occurs. This holds for all shapes across all examples (e.g., 1x1 squares, 3x1 bars, 4x4 squares, 12x12 frames).

#### Positional Interactions (Component Positions → Collective Transformation)
- **Global position transformation**: The positions (bbox coordinates) of all main shapes interact collectively such that they undergo a consistent but unknown transformation in the output (e.g., shifts in min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y). This affects all shapes together, preserving relative structure but remapping absolute locations (e.g., many shapes shift toward lower x/y values, normalizing toward [0,0]). The exact rule (e.g., shift amount or mapping function) is unknown and cannot be explained from the data without further assumption, but it is applied uniformly to all preserved shapes in every example.
- **Peripheral small shapes omission**: Small shapes (typically 1-2 pixels, holes=0, located at high y-values like y=15-18 in inputs) consistently do not appear in outputs or are not transformed with the main set. This suggests they do not interact with the core components (possibly non-interacting labels), as their omission is consistent across all trains without affecting preserved shapes.

#### Non-Interactions (Noted for Completeness, as They Are Consistently Absent)
- No consistent interactions between specific colors (e.g., no Green → Pink effect observed in all cases, as colors differ across trains).
- No consistent effect from holes on other properties (e.g., holes=1 shapes do not reliably alter positions or pixels of other shapes across all examples).
- No consistent adjacency or overlap effects (bboxes do not show uniform touching/overlap patterns that transform predictably in every case).

No other obvious connections (e.g., pixel count → position shift, or specific shape silhouettes → movement) are consistent across all three examples.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 11:45:33] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify and extract the primary "object" or structure from a noisy grid by detecting connected components of the same color, grouping nearby components into meta-structures based on centroid proximity, selecting the largest such group, applying a rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) if specific marker colors (like 5 or 1) are present, and then padding the result to a centered square grid. The output should represent a cleaned, possibly rotated, and squared version of the main visual element, ignoring isolated or small extraneous parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components use 4-way (up, down, left, right) adjacency for same-color pixels; diagonal connections are not considered, which can split shapes if diagonals are involved.
 * Meta-grouping relies on a fixed distance threshold (5.5 units) between component centroids to connect nearby blobs, treating them as part of one object; this threshold may be too loose or tight for varying grid scales, leading to over- or under-grouping.
 * The largest meta-group is selected by total pixel count, assuming it represents the "main" object; this works if noise is smaller but fails if multiple large structures exist or if the main one is fragmented.
 * Rotation is determined solely by the presence of specific colors (5 for clockwise, 1 for counterclockwise, default none); this is a simple rule but ignores orientation hints from shape or position, and the rotation formulas (e.g., cw: nr=sc, nc=new_w-1-sr) must handle bounding box correctly without clipping.
 * Padding centers the content in the smallest square that fits the max dimension, using zeros; this assumes the output size is determined post-rotation, but subtleties include integer division for offsets ((n - h)//2) which can cause slight off-centering if dimensions are odd.
 * Grids can have varying sizes (e.g., 13x13 for train1, 10x10 expected for train2), and outputs must match exactly, including zeros; extraneous pixels or wrong sizes indicate failures in component selection or bounding.
 * Colors represent distinct "parts" (e.g., 3 might be background/structure, 8/6 internal details, 5/1 rotation cues, 4 special elements); preserving exact positions and values during extraction/rotation is critical.
 * Potential noise includes isolated pixels or small clusters outside the main object, which the meta-grouping aims to exclude, but if the threshold merges noise incorrectly, it pollutes the output.
 * Rotation only applies if cw/ccw is detected, but the code includes an unused '180' option; ensure no clipping occurs post-rotation, as dimensions swap (h becomes w).
 * For square padding, the new grid size n = max(height, width) post-rotation; if input is empty or all zeros, default to [[0]].
 * Subtle: Centroids use bounding box center ((min+max)/2), not true geometric center, which approximates for irregular shapes but may misalign grouping distance.
 * The program assumes rows=0 implies empty, and handles empty components gracefully, but fails if all components are small or if colors trigger wrong rotation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component detection and meta-grouping worked partially, as evidenced by train3 being correct, correctly isolating and combining nearby blobs into a main structure.
 * Selection of largest meta-component succeeded in train3 but failed in train1 and train2, likely including extraneous small clusters (e.g., isolated 3s) due to loose threshold, leading to polluted outputs.
 * Rotation detection and application worked in cases without rotation (or correct markers) like possibly train3, but in train1, it seems to have misapplied or not rotated, causing positional mismatches (e.g., generated has 3s in row0 cols2/4 vs expected cols3/10; extra 3s in row12; misplaced 8s and 6s in rows 2-10).
 * In train1, generated output included border-like 3s that don't match expected (e.g., expected has asymmetric 3s in row0 and row12, with a single 3 in row12 col6; generated has symmetric but wrong extras), suggesting over-grouping of background 3s or failure to exclude noise.
 * Train2 generated a malformed 15x15-ish grid with scattered elements (e.g., isolated 4 in row3, fragmented 5s and 3s) vs expected compact 10x10 with structured 5-frame, 3-body, and internal 4; this indicates broken bbox calculation or padding, plus wrong meta-selection (total pixels likely split across groups).
 * Padding to square worked in structure but failed on size in train2 (generated larger than expected 10x10), and in train1 caused slight shifts due to incorrect pre-pad content.
 * Centroid-based distance (threshold 5.5) is helpful but too aggressive in train1 (merged distant 3s) and too conservative in train2 (failed to group 5s into frame).
 * determine_rotation is simplistic and likely correct for marker presence, but train1 expected seems unrotated while generated has anomalies possibly from partial rotation.
 * Overall program flow (components -> meta -> select -> pixels/bbox/colors -> rotate -> pad) is solid core but breaks on noisy inputs; train3 passed likely due to clean/simple structure.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though apply_rotation's '180' branch is unused and could be removed to avoid confusion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x10 grid forming a rough frame of 5s (top/bottom rows partial, sides sparse) with internal 3s in a cross-like or body shape and a single 4 in row6 col6, which visually resembles a structured object (possibly a rotated figure with marker 5s indicating cw rotation).
 * It makes partial sense as an extracted/rotated main structure (5s as rotation cues grouped with 3s body and 4 detail), but without the expected output, it's hard to confirm; however, the sparse 5s on edges and centered 3s/4 suggest correct meta-grouping and padding, unlike train2's mess—likely correct if the input had similar noise.
 * Differences from expectations (mentally simulating): If input has scattered 5s as cues, 3s as main body, and 4 internal, this output cleans it well, but subtle mismatches could occur if rotation was wrong (e.g., 4 position might be flipped) or if threshold missed a 3-fragment; overall, it looks more correct than train1/2 outputs, with no obvious extras or size issues.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 11:59:25] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    def count_non0(row: List[int]) -> int:
        return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + count_non0(g[i])
    max_density = -1.0
    best_s = 0
    best_e = 1
    for s in range(n):
        for e in range(s + 1, n + 1):
            total = prefix[e] - prefix[s]
            area = (e - s) * n
            if area > 0:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 12:00:14] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a sparse grid (likely square, with non-zero values forming a central "image" or figure surrounded by zeros), and the goal is to extract the main content by cropping to its bounding box and then padding/centering it into a new square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the non-zeros. The output should represent the "focused" or "isolated" visual element without extraneous zero padding, but the provided attempt only partially grasps this by attempting to select and pad a subgrid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The core rule is to identify the overall bounding box of all non-zero cells across the entire grid (min/max rows and columns where any non-zero exists), not just a "dense" subset—this captures the full multi-row/multi-column structure of the image, which spans variably filled rows/columns.
 * Padding must be symmetric (or near-symmetric) with zeros to center the cropped content in a square of side max(height, width) of the crop, but the output dimensions should match the expected size (e.g., 13x13 for some cases), and non-zeros must retain their exact positions relative to the crop.
 * Subtlety: Inputs likely have irregular shapes (e.g., borders of one number like 3's or 5's enclosing inner details like 8's/6's or 4's/1's/2's), so cropping must include all connected or visually coherent non-zeros without fragmenting the figure; single-row or partial selections destroy the visual integrity.
 * Easy to miss: Density-based selection (nonzeros per area) favors uniform rows (e.g., solid borders) over sparser multi-row figures, leading to incomplete extractions; vertical/horizontal sparsity varies, so global min/max bounds are essential.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected values in positions—no scaling, rotation, or value changes; zeros outside the figure but inside the pad are fine, but the figure itself must be intact.
 * Considerations from attempts: No object extraction (e.g., connected components) is needed yet, as bounds suffice, but future attempts might require it if multiple disjoint figures exist (though examples suggest one main figure). Grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 to 13x13), so output size derives from content. Avoid assuming full-grid use; always crop first.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def count_non0(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is useful for row-wise analysis but insufficient alone; better for validating density post-crop.)

```python
def find_bounding_box(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    n = len(g)
    min_r, max_r = n, -1
    min_c, max_c = n, -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, i)
                max_r = max(max_r, i)
                min_c = min(min_c, j)
                max_c = max(max_c, j)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```
(This would extract the full non-zero bounds, which is essential; the attempt lacked this and used density instead.)

The attempt's `prefix` sum for subarray density is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle—it optimizes for contiguous high-density rows but ignores global span, leading to single-row picks; do not reuse it. No types or other tools were notably helpful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented symmetric padding to square (e.g., pad_top/bottom/left/right calculations work for centering a subgrid) and preserved non-zero values within the selected slice, but failed entirely on subgrid selection.
 * Missed global bounding box: Instead of finding min/max rows/cols for all non-zeros, it used row-density prefix sums to pick a contiguous row range (s to e) maximizing nonzeros / area, which greedily selected single high-density rows (e.g., solid 3's or 5's borders) over the full figure, resulting in h=1 and incomplete w.
 * For Train 1: Generated 11x11 with only row 5 filled with eleven 3's (likely cropped a single border row, padded minimally since h=1 < w=11, size=11, centered vertically); expected 13x13 full figure with 3's (border), 8's (main body), 6's (details)—difference: missing entire multi-row structure, wrong dimensions (11 vs 13), no inner details, just a horizontal line of 3's instead of a shaped image (e.g., expected has vertical 3's and varied patterns).
 * For Train 2: Generated 10x10 with only row 4 having [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] (single row crop, centered vertically); expected 10x10 full figure with 5's (border?), 3's/4's inside—difference: only one partial row of 5's, missing surrounding rows with 3's/4's and vertical elements (e.g., expected row 0 matches generated row but others are zeroed out).
 * For Train 3: Generated 9x9? with only row 4 having [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4] (single row slice, centered); expected 10x10 checker-like with 4's alternating and inner 1's/2's—difference: only horizontal slice of one row's content, missing alternating 4's pattern and full vertical span (e.g., expected has 10 rows/cols, generated seems smaller and lacks multi-row details).
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., connected components) was attempted, but simple bounds would have helped; density logic is irrelevant/broken for multi-row figures (don't use in future).
 * Overall: All training failed due to incomplete crop; padding worked but on wrong input slice.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is a 13x13 grid with almost all zeros, except row 6 (0-indexed) containing [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5], which appears to be a single cropped row of border-like 5's enclosing 3's, centered vertically with no horizontal padding needed (w≈13).
 * This mirrors training failures: likely extracted only the densest row, ignoring the full multi-row figure (probably a shaped image with 5's as outer, 3's inner, similar to Train 1/2); it misses vertical structure, details, and full bounding box, resulting in a meaningless line instead of a coherent visual (e.g., if input has a figure spanning 7-8 rows like Train 1, this fragments it).
 * To handle test: Switch to global min/max row/col bounds to capture all non-zeros; verify output dimensions match expected (likely 13x13 with full content); density selection caused this error, so avoid it.

[2025-10-02 12:00:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 12:18:44] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract the core non-zero content (likely representing shapes, patterns, or "objects" made of numbers like 3,5,6,8) from an input grid, crop it to its minimal bounding rectangle, and then center that rectangle within a square output grid sized to the maximum of the bounding box's height or width, padding the rest with zeros. The centering must be symmetric (equal padding on opposite sides) to preserve the visual alignment, and the extraction must ignore leading/trailing empty rows/columns but include internal empty spaces as part of the content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main content is defined by the minimal bounding box enclosing all non-zero cells, not just the longest consecutive non-zero rows—internal zero rows/columns within the content must be preserved, but leading/trailing empty rows/columns should be trimmed.
 * Padding for centering must be symmetric: for rows, pad equally top and bottom with (n - h) // 2 on top and the remainder on bottom; for columns, pad equally left and right with (n - w) // 2 on left and remainder on right. Asymmetric padding (e.g., all extra on one side) distorts the visual center.
 * Grids may have scattered non-zero elements that form distinct "objects" or patterns (e.g., borders, shapes like letters or symbols), but the puzzle focuses on the central/primary pattern, potentially ignoring outliers if they don't connect to the main structure—however, all examples suggest including everything in the bounding box without omission.
 * Output size n = max(h, w) of the bounding box, and the entire grid is n x n; if the input is empty or all zeros, output an empty list or zero grid.
 * Subtlety: Row and column ranges must be computed across the entire grid for min/max positions of non-zeros, not assuming consecutiveness—gaps inside the bounding box are okay, but the box must be tight (no extra empty space outside).
 * Numbers represent distinct "colors" or types (e.g., 3 for outlines, 6 for fills), so they must be preserved exactly without alteration.
 * Potential for multiple disconnected components: Examples suggest treating the whole non-zero area as one, but if there are separate objects (e.g., in train2 with 5s as borders), the bounding box should encompass all relevant ones without fragmenting.
 * Edge cases: Odd/even dimensions for padding (use floor division and distribute remainder), all-zero inputs, or asymmetric shapes where w != h.
 * No rotation, scaling, or interpretation of numbers as logic (e.g., no summing or boolean ops)—pure geometric extraction and centering.

```

The main `program` function integrates the above but has bugs: it uses asymmetric horizontal padding (`pad_left = n - w if n > w else 0`, which left-aligns instead of centers) and relies on consecutive rows (causing missed or extra rows). No function for full-grid min/max bounding box (e.g., global min_r/max_r across all non-zeros) is present, which would be more robust.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt partially understands bounding box extraction (identifies row ranges and column mins/maxes) but fails on non-consecutive rows (e.g., assumes longest streak, missing internal gaps in train1 and train3).
 * What worked: Correctly computes column bounds within rows (preserves internal structure); outputs square grids of appropriate size; preserves exact numbers without alteration.
 * What didn't work: Row range selection is too restrictive (consecutive only), leading to cropped or shifted content (e.g., train1 generated starts too early with extra 3s in row 0 and misplaces bottom rows; train2 generated shifts inner patterns left/up, mismatching 3s and 4s positions; train3 generated flips or reorders border patterns incorrectly).
 * Padding is broken: Horizontal padding is left-aligned (not centered), causing right-side mismatches (e.g., in train1 generated, 3s and 8s hug left while expected has balanced spacing; train2 generated has 5s borders not symmetrically placed).
 * No handling for full-grid bounding box: All examples show the need to find global min_r/max_r/c by scanning all non-zeros, not just consecutive—train1 expected includes rows with sparse non-zeros (e.g., row 0 has isolated 3s, row 12 has sparse 3s).
 * Function `get_main_row_range` is flawed/not fully helpful (breaks on gapped content; don't rely on it without modification to find overall min/max row with any non-zero).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components via flood fill) attempted, but may not be needed—examples suggest simple bounding box suffices, though train2/3 have border-like 5s/4s that might need inclusion as frames.
 * Train1: Generated has incorrect top row (includes 3s/8s where expected is mostly zeros with one 3); bottom row has extra 3s; internal rows shifted (e.g., row 2 generated has 8s in wrong cols vs expected). Difference: Over-inclusive row range and left-shift.
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 where expected all zeros except bottom; row3 has 3s/4s misplaced (e.g., col1=3 but expected col1=0); row4 has extra 3s. Difference: Failed to trim top empty rows properly, shifted content up/left (unknown why 4s cluster differently, possibly wrong col min).
 * Train3: Generated borders are interleaved wrong (e.g., row0 starts with 4 but expected row0 all zeros except borders; row2 has 1s in wrong places). Difference: Completely reordered rows, suggesting row range miscomputed (consecutive logic failed on alternating pattern).
 * All trains mismatched shapes subtly (e.g., 6s/8s blobs deformed), likely from incorrect cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it produces a 13x13 grid with the main pattern (3s,4s,5s forming a cross or frame) but shifted severely left/up, with massive zero padding only on bottom/right (e.g., rows 0-2/10-12 all zeros, columns 10-12 sparse), and the 5s borders are not symmetric (hug left with 5s in cols 0-1/11-12 unevenly).
 * It fails to center: The content spans ~rows 3-8, cols 3-9 in generated, but expected should trim to tight box (likely rows ~3-8, cols ~3-9, h=6,w=7,n=7) then pad equally (e.g., 0.5 top/bottom, 0 left/right rounded), resulting in balanced 7x7 embedded in 13x13? Wait, test input seems 13x13 with content in middle, but generated over-pads asymmetrically.
 * Missing tight bounding: Generated includes extra empty rows (e.g., row3 has isolated 3s but full zeros elsewhere), inflating h/w; 4 in center is preserved but offset (row6 col6=4, but should be centered).
 * Does not make sense visually: The pattern looks like a malformed "H" or plus sign squished left, whereas correct should be perfectly centered with equal zero margins all around (e.g., 2-3 zeros top/bottom/left/right based on n=13).
 * To handle test: Need global min/max row/col scan (e.g., find first/last non-zero row/col overall), then center with symmetric pads; account for sparse borders (5s as frame) without cropping them out.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 12:18:44] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a sparse grid (likely square, with non-zero values forming a central "image" or figure surrounded by zeros), and the goal is to extract the main content by cropping to its bounding box and then padding/centering it into a new square grid while preserving the relative positions and values of the non-zeros. The output should represent the "focused" or "isolated" visual element without extraneous zero padding, but the provided attempt only partially grasps this by attempting to select and pad a subgrid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The core rule is to identify the overall bounding box of all non-zero cells across the entire grid (min/max rows and columns where any non-zero exists), not just a "dense" subset—this captures the full multi-row/multi-column structure of the image, which spans variably filled rows/columns.
 * Padding must be symmetric (or near-symmetric) with zeros to center the cropped content in a square of side max(height, width) of the crop, but the output dimensions should match the expected size (e.g., 13x13 for some cases), and non-zeros must retain their exact positions relative to the crop.
 * Subtlety: Inputs likely have irregular shapes (e.g., borders of one number like 3's or 5's enclosing inner details like 8's/6's or 4's/1's/2's), so cropping must include all connected or visually coherent non-zeros without fragmenting the figure; single-row or partial selections destroy the visual integrity.
 * Easy to miss: Density-based selection (nonzeros per area) favors uniform rows (e.g., solid borders) over sparser multi-row figures, leading to incomplete extractions; vertical/horizontal sparsity varies, so global min/max bounds are essential.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected values in positions—no scaling, rotation, or value changes; zeros outside the figure but inside the pad are fine, but the figure itself must be intact.
 * Considerations from attempts: No object extraction (e.g., connected components) is needed yet, as bounds suffice, but future attempts might require it if multiple disjoint figures exist (though examples suggest one main figure). Grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 to 13x13), so output size derives from content. Avoid assuming full-grid use; always crop first.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def count_non0(row: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for x in row if x != 0)
```
(This is useful for row-wise analysis but insufficient alone; better for validating density post-crop.)

```python
def find_bounding_box(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    n = len(g)
    min_r, max_r = n, -1
    min_c, max_c = n, -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != 0:
                min_r = min(min_r, i)
                max_r = max(max_r, i)
                min_c = min(min_c, j)
                max_c = max(max_c, j)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```
(This would extract the full non-zero bounds, which is essential; the attempt lacked this and used density instead.)

The attempt's `prefix` sum for subarray density is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle—it optimizes for contiguous high-density rows but ignores global span, leading to single-row picks; do not reuse it. No types or other tools were notably helpful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented symmetric padding to square (e.g., pad_top/bottom/left/right calculations work for centering a subgrid) and preserved non-zero values within the selected slice, but failed entirely on subgrid selection.
 * Missed global bounding box: Instead of finding min/max rows/cols for all non-zeros, it used row-density prefix sums to pick a contiguous row range (s to e) maximizing nonzeros / area, which greedily selected single high-density rows (e.g., solid 3's or 5's borders) over the full figure, resulting in h=1 and incomplete w.
 * For Train 1: Generated 11x11 with only row 5 filled with eleven 3's (likely cropped a single border row, padded minimally since h=1 < w=11, size=11, centered vertically); expected 13x13 full figure with 3's (border), 8's (main body), 6's (details)—difference: missing entire multi-row structure, wrong dimensions (11 vs 13), no inner details, just a horizontal line of 3's instead of a shaped image (e.g., expected has vertical 3's and varied patterns).
 * For Train 2: Generated 10x10 with only row 4 having [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5] (single row crop, centered vertically); expected 10x10 full figure with 5's (border?), 3's/4's inside—difference: only one partial row of 5's, missing surrounding rows with 3's/4's and vertical elements (e.g., expected row 0 matches generated row but others are zeroed out).
 * For Train 3: Generated 9x9? with only row 4 having [4,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,4] (single row slice, centered); expected 10x10 checker-like with 4's alternating and inner 1's/2's—difference: only horizontal slice of one row's content, missing alternating 4's pattern and full vertical span (e.g., expected has 10 rows/cols, generated seems smaller and lacks multi-row details).
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., connected components) was attempted, but simple bounds would have helped; density logic is irrelevant/broken for multi-row figures (don't use in future).
 * Overall: All training failed due to incomplete crop; padding worked but on wrong input slice.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is a 13x13 grid with almost all zeros, except row 6 (0-indexed) containing [5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5], which appears to be a single cropped row of border-like 5's enclosing 3's, centered vertically with no horizontal padding needed (w≈13).
 * This mirrors training failures: likely extracted only the densest row, ignoring the full multi-row figure (probably a shaped image with 5's as outer, 3's inner, similar to Train 1/2); it misses vertical structure, details, and full bounding box, resulting in a meaningless line instead of a coherent visual (e.g., if input has a figure spanning 7-8 rows like Train 1, this fragments it).
 * To handle test: Switch to global min/max row/col bounds to capture all non-zeros; verify output dimensions match expected (likely 13x13 with full content); density selection caused this error, so avoid it.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to automatically detect, crop, and pad the central "object" or pattern (a connected or dense region of non-zero values representing shapes like numbers or symbols) to produce a tight, square bounding box output, removing empty borders while preserving the relative structure and values of the pattern. The input grids are larger (e.g., 20x20) with sparse non-zero elements forming the puzzle elements, and the output should be a smaller square grid (size determined by the bounding box) with zero-padding if needed to square it.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main pattern is a contiguous or near-contiguous blob of non-zero cells (e.g., digits like 3,8,6 representing filled pixels), often vertically or horizontally elongated, surrounded by large empty (zero) borders; cropping must tightly bound this blob without including irrelevant empty space or extraneous small features.
 * Row_nonzero counts (number of positive cells per row) are key for identifying dense rows, but the max subarray must handle cases where the blob isn't perfectly contiguous—subtle gaps (e.g., single zero rows/columns within the blob) should not split it if they are minimal.
 * Column bounding (min_c, max_c) must be recomputed after row trimming to avoid including outlier columns from trimmed rows; width/height calculation affects square sizing, where size = max(height, width), and padding is symmetric (//2 flooring).
 * Trimming logic for excess height (when height > width) should prioritize removing rows with fewer non-zeros, but avoid over-trimming if it cuts into the core pattern; additional checks for rows with <2 non-zeros help remove thin borders but can erroneously trim meaningful sparse rows in the pattern.
 * Patterns may have internal zeros (e.g., holes in '8's), so non-zero density alone isn't perfect—consider connectivity (e.g., flood fill for blobs) to distinguish main object from noise like isolated cells.
 * Square padding must center the cropped region, with pad_top/bottom/left/right calculated correctly; outputs must match exact expected sizes and positions, including preserving all non-zero values without alteration.
 * Subtle elements: Some patterns have asymmetric shapes (e.g., train1 has a central '8' with '3' borders and '6' insert); small disconnected components (e.g., train2's border '5's) should be excluded if not part of the main blob; rotations or symmetries in borders (e.g., train3's checkerboard '4's) may mislead density-based cropping.
 * Fallbacks for empty or invalid ranges (e.g., start > end) produce all-zero grids, but this shouldn't trigger on valid inputs; n=20 is hardcoded, assuming fixed input size.
 * All examples show the main pattern is roughly centered but offset, requiring dynamic detection rather than fixed coordinates.

```

(Note: No custom types like PuzzleElement are present; the above are core helpers from the attempt. No object extraction function is provided, but one could be added via flood-fill for connected components to better identify the main blob over density alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses density-based row selection (max subarray on row_nonzero) which works partially for finding core row ranges but fails to handle gapped or asymmetric blobs, leading to incorrect start/end (e.g., train1 includes extra top/bottom empty rows).
 * Column trimming after row selection is recomputed correctly in theory, but initial min_c/max_c uses untrimmed rows, causing width overestimation; this results in oversized squares with misplaced padding.
 * Height trimming when height > width removes low-density rows from ends, which works for borders but over-trims in train1 (cuts '3' borders) and train2 (distorts '3' and '4' shapes); the <2 non-zero check exacerbates this by removing sparse but essential rows.
 * Padding calculation (symmetric with //2) is mostly correct but fails due to wrong crop dimensions, leading to off-center or oversized outputs (e.g., train1 generated 18x18 vs expected 13x13).
 * All training examples fail: Train1 generated includes full-width empty borders and misses tight crop around central pattern (e.g., generated has wide left/right zeros, expected trims to 13 cols with specific '3','8','6' layout); Train2 generated shifts '3's and '4's incorrectly (e.g., row3 has '3's in wrong positions vs expected, and excludes some border '5's); Train3 generated flips or misaligns the central '1','2' pattern and includes extra '4' borders (e.g., row2 has isolated '1' misplaced vs expected tighter crop).
 * max_subarray_indices is helpful for dense contiguous cases but broken for non-contiguous (e.g., doesn't bridge small gaps in row_nonzero); the fallback all-zero grid is unhelpful and triggers incorrectly.
 * No connectivity check (e.g., flood-fill for main blob) means small isolated non-zeros (e.g., train2's stray '5's) pollute bounds; this is essential but missing.
 * Hardcoded n=20 assumes fixed size, which works for these inputs but limits generality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to crop a partial or multiple disconnected regions incorrectly, resulting in a tall, narrow 19x19? grid with scattered small patterns (e.g., isolated '5's and '3's in rows 1-4 and 10-14, a small '4' block in rows 12, and bottom '5' lines) instead of a single tight square bounding the main central blob.
 * It includes irrelevant top isolated '3's and '5's (rows 1-4), skips the dense mid-section (rows 6-8 with '5's), and fragments the lower '3'/'4'/'5' pattern (rows 10-18), suggesting over-trimming or wrong row_start/end; expected should consolidate the main lower-central pattern (e.g., the '3'/'4'/'5' cluster around rows 10-18, cols 10-18) into a ~9x9 square, excluding top noise.
 * Padding seems absent or asymmetric (many full-zero rows/cols), and the output isn't squared properly; it looks like multiple small objects were extracted separately rather than one main one, missing the puzzle's focus on the primary connected/dense region.
 * This indicates the density trimming fails on multi-blob inputs with varying densities, over-relying on max subarray without blob merging.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the input is a rectangular grid of integers (likely representing colored or patterned "pixels" in a larger canvas with empty space), and the goal is to extract, crop, and reformat the core content into a centered square grid of appropriate size, preserving the relative positions and values of non-zero elements while removing or padding around extraneous empty areas or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The core content appears to be a single main "object" or patterned block (e.g., a figure made of numbers like 3,8,6 in example 1, or 5,3,4 in example 2), often surrounded by empty (zero) rows/columns or decorative borders; the output must isolate this block without including outer noise.
 * Bounding box calculation must be tight: min/max rows and columns should only encompass the non-zero elements of the main object, but examples show that not all non-empty rows are part of the main block (e.g., isolated single rows like the top/bottom in example 1's expected output are excluded or repositioned).
 * Padding is centered and uses zeros, but the target size N is the max of row/col spans of the cropped block; however, outputs are sometimes not perfectly square or have asymmetric padding, suggesting the crop might include subtle extensions or exclude parts.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have multiple disconnected components (e.g., border-like lines of 3's or 5's in examples 1-3), but only the central/dense object is kept; empty rows within the block are preserved if they are part of the pattern. Rotations, mirrors, or value changes are not involved—outputs retain exact values and relative positions.
 * Outputs are always square (or padded to square), but input sizes vary (e.g., 13x13 in ex1, 11x11 in ex2/3); test input seems 13x13 with a central pattern of 3's,4's,5's flanked by 5's on sides.
 * Considerations across attempts: Longest consecutive non-empty rows may over-include if there are thin border rows; bounding columns must ignore outliers. No evidence of object extraction beyond simple bounding—complex shapes (e.g., holes or blobs) aren't handled yet. Padding order (rows then columns) can cause misalignment if crop is rectangular.

    """Transformation: Pad the grid with empty columns centered to reach target size N."""
    # (Implementation as provided; useful for horizontal centering.)
```
(Helpful for horizontal centering; order with row padding matters.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt focused on finding the longest consecutive non-empty row block, cropping to its bounding columns, and padding to a square— this correctly identifies a dense central area but over-includes border-like rows (e.g., top/bottom rows of 3's in ex1 generated but shifted/partial in expected).
 * What worked: Cropping and padding mechanics produce square outputs with preserved values; bounding columns tighten horizontal span well (e.g., reduces wide empty sides).
 * What didn't work: Row selection via longest consecutive block includes extraneous borders, leading to taller-than-needed crops (e.g., ex1 generated 13 rows with mismatched top/bottom vs. expected 13 but different positioning); padding centers incorrectly due to wrong initial crop, causing shifts (e.g., ex1 row 0 has 3's in cols 2,4 but expected has them in 3,10).
 * Ex1 differences: Generated has extra 3's in row0 col4, row2 has 8's/3's misplaced vs. expected (e.g., expected row2: 3 at col1,8 at3, etc.; unknown why but likely border inclusion); row10 in generated has 8's/3's but expected has different 8 pattern—crop too wide vertically.
 * Ex2 differences: Generated includes isolated row2 [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] and pads to 11x11 but expected excludes/repositions it, has row1 as all zeros except 3, and different internal shifts (e.g., generated row4 has 3's at1-2 but expected row3 has 3's at3-5); seems to miss central density focus.
 * Ex3 differences: Generated crops to include alternating border rows (e.g., rows 1-2,9-10 as 4/0 patterns) but expected excludes them, focusing on inner 1/2 block (e.g., expected starts with border but crops inner 8 rows tightly); generated row7 has 1's misplaced vs. expected row6.
 * No object extraction beyond bounding—may need functions to detect/ignore thin borders or find "main blob" via connectivity/density.
 * Function `find_longest_consecutive_non_empty_rows` is partially helpful but broken for multi-component grids (over-inclusive); keep but refine.
 * Padding functions are helpful and correct in isolation but unhelpful when chained after bad crop.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it crops to a 13x13 square with heavy top/bottom padding (empty rows 0-2,10-12) and includes side 5's (cols 0-1,11-12) as part of the main block, but the central pattern (3's frame around 4's) seems shifted left/down compared to input density; input has 5's only on sides of rows 4,6,8 but generated embeds them fully, suggesting over-cropping horizontally/vertically without excluding borders.
 * It misses subtlety of isolating the inner 3/4 pattern (likely the "object") while perhaps treating side 5's as noise; output has symmetric padding but the embedded block is 7 rows high (3-9) vs. input's scattered rows, indicating longest-block logic grabbed too much vertically but not centered properly.
 * To handle test: Need better main-block detection (e.g., ignore side columns with uniform 5's) and tighter vertical crop to rows 3-9, padding to ~9x9 or max span, then re-pad to square—current output looks like a bloated version of the input without true extraction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to process a square grid of integers (likely representing pixel-like values for shapes or images) by identifying and extracting the "main" non-zero connected component (object), cropping to its tight bounding box, and padding it to a square while preserving the original values and structure. The challenge involves correctly defining connectivity (8-connected), selecting the right component (central and largest), handling borders/frames that might connect to or surround the main object, and ensuring the extraction matches subtle positional details without introducing artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connectivity for components (diagonal neighbors count as connected), as non-zero cells can touch diagonally to form a single object.
 * The "main" component is typically the one closest to the grid center (measured by bounding box center distance to grid center), with ties broken by size (largest area); ignore small or peripheral components like borders or noise.
 * Borders or frames (e.g., repeating patterns of 3's or 4's around the edges) often form separate components or might connect to the main object, but they should be excluded—do not include them in the extraction unless they are part of the central shape.
 * After extracting the subgrid via bounding box, pad to the smallest square that fits (side length = max(height, width of subgrid)), centering the content with zeros; padding must be symmetric where possible but can be uneven if dimensions require it.
 * Grids may have multiple distinct values (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6 for object parts, 4/1/2 for shapes), but treat all non-zero as connectable regardless of value—do not segment by value.
 * Subtle positional mismatches occur frequently: e.g., in rotations or irregular shapes, the bounding box might shift, causing rows/columns to align differently; ensure the extracted subgrid retains exact relative positions.
 * Handle empty or single-cell cases gracefully (return zero-padded grid if no component).
 * Grids are always square input (n x n), but output must also be square (possibly smaller effective size after padding).
 * Easy to miss: Components might not be fully enclosed; test for cases where the main object touches the border, requiring careful separation; also, center calculation uses floating-point bounding box midpoint, so use precise distance formula.
 * Padding centers the subgrid, so calculate top/left pads as floor((n - dim)/2), with remainder on bottom/right.
 * Visually, outputs should "zoom in" on the central irregular shape, removing outer frames, but preserving internal details like holes or protrusions (e.g., isolated 6's or 8's).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implements 8-connected DFS for components, bounding box calculation, central selection with distance tiebreaker, subgrid extraction, and centered zero-padding—these are solid building blocks and worked for basic structure but failed to isolate the main object properly.
 * What worked: Component detection accurately finds non-zero groups (e.g., in example 1, it grabs a large central blob with 8's and 6's); padding centers content without distortion; handles empty cases by returning zero grid.
 * What didn't work: In all training examples, it incorrectly includes or excludes parts of the main object due to over-merging with borders (e.g., in example 1, generated includes extra 3's on left/top as part of the component, shifting the entire shape right/down compared to expected, where top row has 3's more centered and bottom has isolated 3's in columns 6-7; differences include row 0: generated [0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]—extra 3's and misaligned; row 2: generated has 8's starting earlier; row 10: generated [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,0] vs expected [0,3,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,3,0]—missing 8's in positions 2-5, extra in 9; unknown why bounding box expanded to include border 3's, perhaps partial connectivity).
 * In example 2, generated mismatches inner 3's and 4's positions (e.g., row 1: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]—3 shifted right; row 3: generated [0,3,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,5] vs expected [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,5]—extra 3's in cols 1-2, missing in 8; row 4: generated has 3's in 2 and 8 vs expected 3's in 1-2; likely selected a component that merged border 5's incorrectly with inner shapes).
 * In example 3, generated treats the 4's frame as part of or adjacent to the central 1/2 component, resulting in a larger bounding box that includes the entire frame (e.g., row 0: [4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0] vs expected [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]—starts with 4 instead of 0, and pattern is shifted; row 2: generated [4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0] includes frame 4's at ends vs expected [0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4] which crops tighter, starting inner content earlier; row 5: generated [0,4,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,4] vs expected [4,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,4,0]—rotated or flipped feel, with 4's misplaced; unknown exact cause, but likely frame 4's form a connected ring around the center, pulling the bounding box outward).
 * Overall, the attempt overestimates the main component by including border-connected cells, leading to shifted/wider outputs; selection metric works but needs refinement to explicitly exclude border-like components (e.g., those touching edges).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and mostly correct, though the full program() integrates them poorly for border separation; do not discard, but enhance select_main_component to penalize edge-touching components.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output [[5,5],[0,0]] appears correct at first glance for a tiny 2x2 input grid (assuming input is [[5,5],[0,0]]), as the non-zero cells [5,5] in row 0 form a connected component (side-by-side, 8-connected), bounding box is row 0 col 0-1, extraction is [[5,5]], padding to 2x2 adds [0,0] below, matching exactly—no border issues here since it's small and no extraneous components.
 * However, it only "makes sense" if the puzzle rules apply uniformly; for larger cases, this simple pass doesn't demonstrate handling of the core subtlety (border exclusion), so it might coincidentally work but not generalize—watch for tests with frames around small objects, where it could wrongly include them and shift the [5,5] row.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify and extract the primary "image" or figure from a sparse grid of positive integers (likely representing colored pixels or segments of a logo/object), crop it to a tight bounding box (possibly allowing limited gaps for incomplete rows/columns), pad it to a centered square of side length equal to the maximum of the cropped height and width, and output the result as a square grid. The extraction must preserve the relative positions and values of the non-zero elements while ignoring empty borders and disconnected noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid represents a 2D image with 0s as background/empty and positive integers as filled pixels of different "colors" or types (e.g., 3,5,6,8 in train1; 3,4,5 in train2; 1,2,4 in train3), and the output must retain these exact values without alteration.
 * Cropping should focus on the densest or most continuous block of non-zeros, treating the grid as potentially containing a single main object with possible thin gaps (e.g., single empty rows/columns might be tolerated, but larger gaps separate components).
 * Padding must be even (centered) on all sides to form a square, using 0s, but the square size is max(cropped_height, cropped_width), not the original grid size—subtly, this can lead to oversized outputs if cropping is loose.
 * Disconnected components (e.g., separate blobs of the same or different numbers) should likely be ignored except for the main/largest one; the test input has multiple scattered clusters (5's in rows 6-7 and 17-19; 3's and 4 in rows 9-15), suggesting the program must select the primary figure, not union all.
 * Row/column selection prioritizes maximum "density" (e.g., sum of non-zeros or count of non-empty lines), but with gap tolerance: train1 expected allows some irregularity (e.g., partial rows at top/bottom), while generated includes extras like full empty rows.
 * Fallback bounding box logic (min-max non-zero positions) is sometimes needed if no perfect contiguous subarray exists, but it must not include large empty margins.
 * Outputs are square but sized to the cropped content (e.g., train2 expected is 10x10, not 12x12), implying tight cropping is key; loose cropping bloats the square unnecessarily.
 * Subtle asymmetry in expected outputs: train1 expected has uneven padding (e.g., more empty space on right/bottom), but generated is more symmetric yet includes unwanted elements (e.g., extra 3's in row0/col2).
 * Rotation, mirroring, or reordering is not needed—preserve original orientation and positions relative to crop.
 * Edge cases: fully disconnected grids (like test) require selecting the largest/densest component; all-zero grids should output empty square of original size? But program returns n x n zeros, which may be correct.
 * Non-zero counts per row/column are useful metrics, but "sum of values" vs. "count of non-zeros" matters—program uses count, but if values represent thickness, sum might be better (unknown, but generated mismatches suggest count is insufficient).
 * Grids can be non-square originally, but outputs are always square; n varies (13 in train1, 12 in train2/3, 20 in test).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies the need for density-based cropping using non-zero counts per row/column and gap-tolerant subarray search, which partially worked for finding approximate bounds in contiguous cases but failed due to incorrect gap tolerances (e.g., max_gap=1 for rows included extra sparse rows in train1, leading to 14x14 instead of 13x13).
 * Cropping logic for columns used max_gap=0 (strict contiguous), with fallback to min-max bounding, but this over-included sparse columns in train1 (e.g., generated has extra 0's and shifted 3's on left/right) and failed to isolate the main figure in train2/3 (generated 12x12 includes borders, expected 10x10 crops tighter).
 * Padding to max(h,w) with centered 0's is correct in principle but produced oversized/inaccurate squares because upstream cropping was loose; e.g., train1 generated includes unwanted top/bottom rows with isolated 3's, mismatching expected's tighter crop (e.g., expected row0 has isolated 3's but different positions).
 * For train1, generated mismatched blob shapes: e.g., row2 has [3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,...] vs. expected [0,3,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,3,3]—unknown why, possibly due to row selection including row1 (all 3's) but shifting columns wrong; also added extra bottom empty row.
 * For train2, generated included full empty borders (12x12) and misplaced elements (e.g., row1 [0,5,0,5,...] vs. expected starting directly with [5,0,5,...] in a 10x10 crop), failing to exclude outer empties and select the inner 3/4/5 figure tightly; fallback column logic didn't trigger properly.
 * For train3, similar issue: generated 12x12 with borders, mismatching expected 10x10 crop (e.g., generated row2 [0,0,4,0,4,...] includes extras vs. expected direct [0,4,0,4,...]); strict column gap=0 excluded valid irregular parts like scattered 1's/2's.
 * No object extraction function was present, but one could be added to find connected components (e.g., via flood-fill on non-zeros) to isolate the main blob, as density alone misses disconnected noise.
 * The max_subarray function is helpful and mostly correct but needs tunable gaps (e.g., try 0-2) and perhaps sum-of-values instead of count for density.
 * compute_row_nonzero is useful and correct, but a column version is implied and works partially.
 * No unhelpful/broken functions in this attempt—all are relevant, but the overall program lacks component selection, leading to inclusion of noise.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it produces a 20x20 grid (original size) with only a small cropped/padded region of 3's,4's,5's in the top-leftish area (rows ~6-14, cols ~7-12), but ignores lower 5's (rows 17-19) and pads excessively with zeros everywhere else, resulting in a mostly empty grid that doesn't isolate a single main figure.
 * Compared to input, it captured the middle 3/4 cluster but missed the top 5's (rows 6-7) and bottom 5's (rows 17-19), suggesting the row selection with max_gap=1 picked only one component; expected likely needs to select the largest/densest (the 3/4 block) and crop tightly to ~6x6 or so, padded to square without the full 20x20 bloat.
 * The output makes partial sense as a cropped attempt but is incorrect because it doesn't form a compact square representation of the primary content—it's diluted by huge zero padding, and the positioned content (e.g., 5's in rows 6-7 of output match input's top 5's? Wait, no—output rows 6-7 have 5's in cols 7-11, matching input row6-7, but then jumps to 3's in row9-15, indicating it unioned non-contiguous rows, which bloated h=10+ but with gaps, violating gap tolerance.
 * To handle test, must add connected component analysis to pick one main object (likely the densest 3/4 block in rows9-15, cols6-13), crop tightly (h~7, w~8, pad to 8x8), excluding scattered 5's as noise.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to clean up a grid by isolating the core pattern or "object" (e.g., letters, shapes, or symbols formed by non-zero cells) while removing surrounding noise, borders, or extraneous connected elements, then cropping tightly and padding to a centered square if needed. The process emphasizes distinguishing the main blob from decorative or irregular borders that are often connected but should be excluded to match the expected clean, minimal representations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids often have outer borders (e.g., 3's in example 1, 5's in example 2, 4's in example 3) that form connected components of non-zero cells but are noise; the main pattern is typically an inner, denser, or more structured blob that may not be the absolute largest component.
 * Use 8-connectivity for components to capture diagonal connections in patterns like letters or shapes, but avoid merging borders with the core if they touch—subtlety is detecting "frame-like" structures vs. solid fills.
 * Cropping must be to the tight bounding box of the main component only, preserving internal zeros (holes or gaps) but excluding isolated noise within the crop if it's not part of the pattern.
 * Padding to square uses the max dimension, centered symmetrically, with zeros; however, if the input is already square-like, no padding occurs, but the core issue is often pre-padding cleanup.
 * Expected outputs show irregular borders adjusted (e.g., some border cells zeroed out or shifted), suggesting rules like removing single-cell protrusions, handling asymmetric noise, or prioritizing components by density/shape over size.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may have internal components (e.g., holes with 0's inside non-zeros) that must stay; borders may not fully enclose (e.g., gaps in test input); values like 3,4,5,6,8 represent different "inks" but connectivity is by non-zero regardless of value.
 * All non-zero cells are treated equally for connectivity, but outputs preserve original values—don't normalize or change them.
 * Edge cases: Empty or all-zero grids return empty; small isolated cells are noise; multiple components require selecting the "primary" one (not always largest, as borders can be bigger).
 * Considerations across attempts: Flood fill/DFS is reliable for components but needs filtering (e.g., by size threshold, perimeter-to-area ratio for "frame" detection, or excluding components touching grid edges).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly implemented connected components, bounding box cropping, and centered square padding, which worked for basic structure preservation and output formatting (e.g., kept internal values and zeros intact).
 * What didn't work: Relied on the largest component, which included borders/noise (e.g., full 3-border in train 1 generated vs. expected irregular/partial border with some 0's and shifted positions; similar for 5-borders in train 2 and 4-borders in train 3), leading to oversized crops that retained unwanted elements.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 3's in top/bottom rows (e.g., full row of 3's in row 1/11 vs. expected sparse 3's and 0's); internal 8's and 6's shifted or added erroneously (e.g., row 2 has 8's where expected has 0's); bottom row has misplaced 3's.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated includes border 5's bleeding into inner pattern (e.g., row 3 has 3's in cols 1-2 where expected has 0's; row 4 has extra 3's and missing 4's in positions); row 1 has 3 where expected has all 0's except end.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated rotates or includes border as part of pattern (e.g., row 0 starts with 4's alternating vs. expected starting with 0; inner 1's and 2's misplaced, like row 2 has extra 0's and 1's shifted); overall looks like border merged without exclusion.
 * Function `get_largest_component` is broken/not helpful as-is (always picks size-max, ignoring border-like components; suggest filtering by not touching edges or by shape metrics).
 * Padding functions (e.g., `calculate_vertical_padding`, `apply_padding`) are helpful and correct but underutilized since crops are too large, resulting in no/minimal padding.
 * `crop_to_bounds` preserves isolated cells within bounds (good), but since wrong component is chosen, it includes noise.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output matches the input grid exactly (7x7 with irregular 3/4 border and inner pattern), which does not look correct because prior training examples show the need for cleanup—likely the expected output should exclude or zero out the incomplete border (e.g., top-left 3's in rows 0-1 might be noise, inner 4 as main, with tighter crop/pad to square without edge protrusions like row 6's lone 3).
 * It makes sense as a "no-op" from the program's logic (largest component spans nearly whole grid, bounding box is full 7x7, no padding needed), but fails the puzzle's intent since borders aren't removed, leading to unclean pattern (e.g., asymmetric 0's and 3's around the central 4 and lines).
 * To handle test: Program needs border exclusion (e.g., ignore components touching all four edges) to crop just the inner cross-like pattern with 4, padding to square if height/width differ after cleanup.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images (likely pixel art or figure extraction) where the task is to identify, isolate, and normalize the primary "object" or figure from a larger scene, typically by extracting a connected region of non-zero cells, cropping to its bounding box, resizing/padding to a square grid, and possibly applying transformations like rotation or alignment to match a canonical orientation. The output must exactly replicate specific expected layouts, which appear to emphasize precise positioning, exclusion of background or border elements, and correct handling of multiple components or numbers (e.g., 3 as borders, 6/8 as inner shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use numbers (e.g., 3 for borders/frames, 6/8/4/1/2 for object parts) to represent distinct visual elements; zeros are empty space, and connectivity defines "objects," but 8-connectivity (diagonals) may over-connect borders or backgrounds, leading to inclusion of unwanted areas.
 * The "main" object is often the largest connected component of non-zeros, but it must exclude persistent borders/frames (e.g., 3's or 4's that form enclosures) and focus on inner irregular shapes; subtle: borders may be connected but should be omitted or treated separately to avoid bloating the bounding box.
 * Cropping uses the tight bounding box (min/max row/col), then pads to the max side length square with zeros, but placement must be top-left aligned in the new grid—however, expected outputs show shifts, rotations (e.g., 90-degree turns), or flips to "upright" the figure, suggesting orientation normalization based on asymmetry (e.g., making protrusions point down or centering).
 * Padding and alignment are critical: new grid is square, but expected may have uneven padding (e.g., more zeros on top/bottom) to match visual centering or specific offsets; easy to miss that the entire output must be exactly the expected size and positions, not just the shape.
 * Multiple components exist (e.g., inner blobs of different numbers like 6 and 8 may be separate but part of one "object" if visually cohesive); the code merges them if connected, but expected sometimes separates or reorients independently.
 * Subtle elements: In enclosed scenes (e.g., train1/3), the main object is inside a frame—code includes frame if connected; rotation/flip is needed if input is sideways (e.g., train3 generated vs. expected shows row/col swap like a transpose or 90-degree clockwise rotation). Handle varying grid sizes (10x13, 10x10, 7x7) by outputting square but preserving relative positions. Non-zero cells must retain exact values; zeros must match precisely, including sparse placements.
 * Across attempts: No input grids provided, so infer from outputs—expected often has "cleaner" or reoriented inner shapes with borders detached; test case likely a simple shape (e.g., cross or letter-like with 3's) that needs similar extraction/rotation. Avoid over-cropping (losing protrusions) or under-padding (mismatched sizes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it correctly identifies non-zero positions and uses connected components to extract regions, which works for isolating potential objects but fails on all trainings due to including connected borders/frames as part of the main component (e.g., train1/3 bloat the shape with 3's/4's).
 * What worked: Bounding box cropping and square padding logic produces a normalized size/output; component extraction via stack/visited avoids revisits and handles sparse grids well.
 * What didn't work: 8-connectivity merges inner objects with enclosing borders (e.g., train1 generated includes extra 3's in rows 1/3/13 vs. expected's sparser top/bottom; train3 generated has border rows swapped vs. expected, suggesting no rotation applied); largest component assumption fails when borders are biggest (e.g., train2 generated crops to 10x10 but misplaces 5's/3's/4's, losing some zeros and connections).
 * Train1: Generated has denser 3's/8's/6's with incorrect top row [0,0,3,0,3,...] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,0,...] (extra 3's, wrong offsets); bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs. expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] (misaligned protrusions); inner rows like row3 [3,3,8,8,0,...] vs. [0,3,0,8,0,...] show over-connected 3's/8's, possibly from diagonal links.
 * Train2: Generated starts with [0,0,5,0,5,5,...] but expected [5,0,5,0,5,5,...] (missing leading 5's, wrong alignment); row4 [0,3,3,0,4,...] vs. expected [0,0,3,0,0,...] (extra 3's, 4's shifted); overall shape is cropped but rotated/misplaced, e.g., 5's frame not fully enclosed as in expected.
 * Train3: Generated border alternates starting with 4 in col0 row0 vs. expected starting with 0 (appears as 90-degree rotation or transpose needed); inner [4,0,0,0,0,1,...] vs. [0,4,0,1,1,...] shows slight shifts in 1's/2's positions, likely from including full connected 4's border.
 * find_connected_components is helpful but broken for this puzzle due to 8-connectivity (try 4-connectivity: only [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)] to detach diagonals); positions extraction is solid and reusable.
 * No other functions provided; the main program is relevant but incomplete (add rotation, e.g., check orientations and rotate grid 90/180/270 degrees to match expected asymmetry).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it appears to be a tight crop of a 3's-only shape (forming a sort of "E" or asymmetric cross in 7x7) with top-left alignment and bottom protrusion [0,0,0,0,3,0,0], but without input grid, it likely includes unwanted connected elements or fails orientation like in trainings (e.g., if input has a rotated figure or border, this misses rotation/centering, leading to mismatched positions). It makes sense as a cropped connected component of 3's but not as the full puzzle solution, since trainings show expected outputs require detaching inners, adding sparse zeros, or reorienting—here, the dense 3's block and uneven padding (e.g., row7 has isolated 3's) probably doesn't match an "upright" canonical form, and size (7x7) assumes max side without verification against expected subtlety like frame exclusion.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean up a colored grid (likely representing a segmented image or diagram) by identifying and removing small or peripheral connected components (blobs of the same integer value), then trimming empty borders to create a minimal bounding box, and finally padding to a square shape while preserving the core structure of larger components. The expected outputs suggest a focus on retaining main "objects" or "shapes" (e.g., letters, symbols, or diagrams formed by colored regions) while eliminating noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts, especially those in peripheral or high-row positions, to match a compact, cleaned representation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right) and defined by matching integer values (colors like 3,5,6,8); size is counted by number of cells, and small ones (size <=2) should be omitted only if they are "peripheral" – specifically, those with minimum row index >=15 (assuming row 0 is top, so "high y" means lower rows? Wait, code uses min_r_comp >=15, but examples suggest top rows are low indices; this may be inverted or grid-specific).
 * Omission/resetting: After identifying a small component, reflood it with 0s using the original grid to avoid visited array issues, but ensure it doesn't accidentally affect larger components of the same color.
 * Trimming: Extract the minimal bounding box of non-zero cells post-omission; if no non-zeros remain, return empty; subtleties include handling uneven shapes (e.g., examples show irregular blobs like letters 'E' or 'F' in colors).
 * Padding: Add zero rows/columns only on right and bottom to reach max(h,w) side length; preserve top-left alignment.
 * Subtle elements: Grids may have "noise" like isolated 1-2 cell blobs in borders or specific rows (e.g., example 1 has stray 3's in top/bottom rows to remove); colors represent distinct objects (don't merge across colors); no holes mentioned, but examples have enclosed areas (e.g., 6's might form loops); row indexing matters – example 1 expected removes top-left 3's but keeps some bottom ones, suggesting peripheral means outer edges or specific row thresholds; example 3 shows heavy trimming needed from a sparse 15x15 to 10x10, implying removal of all but central multi-color structure; test input has vertical stacks of 5's/3's separated by empty rows, suggesting need to remove isolated small groups and connect or preserve main horizontal structures.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connections; handle empty grids gracefully; post-trim grid may not be square initially, but padding ensures it; potential over-removal (e.g., keeping size=3+ even if peripheral); row threshold >=15 seems arbitrary/misapplied (example 1 has rows up to 12, so maybe threshold is wrong or rows are bottom-up).
 * Other considerations: Examples suggest puzzle is about "object extraction" from noisy scans (e.g., OCR-like cleanup); test input has long empty rows/columns, so trimming must be aggressive; colors like 4/6 may form "filled" shapes, while 3/5/8 are outlines; don't assume square input – outputs vary (13x13, 10x10, 10x10).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt shown, composing omission, trim, and pad; it partially understands component detection and cleanup but fails all trainings due to incomplete removal (e.g., keeps some small 3's in ex1 top row [positions 2 and 4 in gen vs expected only at 3 and 10]; ex1 row2 starts with [3,3,...] vs expected [0,3,...], suggesting didn't remove left-peripheral size=2 blob; ex1 bottom row [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0] – partial removal but wrong positions).
 * Ex2: Generated keeps extra 3's in row3 [0,3,3,0,...] vs expected [0,0,3,0,...]; row4 [5,0,3,0,4,4,0,3,3,0] vs [5,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,0,0] – mismatches in 3/4 placement, likely didn't remove small isolated 3's or mis-trimmed; overall shape is close but blob connectivity wrong (e.g., 4's not fully filled).
 * Ex3: Generated retains full 15x15 with sparse top/bottom (e.g., isolated 1's/4's at edges) vs expected compact 10x10 central structure; omission didn't trigger (components larger? or threshold >=15 skips all since grid is 15 rows, min_r=0 <15); trim/pad ineffective as bounding box includes empties.
 * Function `omit_peripheral_small_components` is helpful but broken: row threshold too high (skips removals in small grids); reset uses original g but may miss if visited interferes; doesn't handle "peripheral" as edge-distance (e.g., cols 0 or rows 0/last).
 * `trim_empty_borders` is helpful and correct in logic but fails if upstream has unremoved noise expanding bounds.
 * `pad_to_square` is helpful and correct but irrelevant if prior steps wrong.
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., no function to list all components by size/color/min-max bounds); attempt misses that some "small" might be size>2 if peripheral, or need to remove based on position not just size/row.
 * General: No handling of multi-color interactions (e.g., ex1 has 3 as background/outline?); attempt assumes no holes but ex1/2 have potential enclosed 0's in 6/4.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a sparse 19x19 grid retaining isolated small stacks (e.g., vertical 5's in cols 3-4 rows 0-4, horizontal 5's in rows 7-8 cols 11-15, 3's in row10 cols11-12 and row15 col13) without removal, and long empty rows/columns (e.g., rows 5-6,9,16-18 all zero), suggesting omission didn't trigger (components size=3+? or threshold issue) and trim failed to crop to central multi-color structure around rows10-15 cols10-18 (3's/4's/5's forming shapes); expected should be a trimmed square (likely ~8x10 or similar) with main blobs (e.g., 3's as bars, 5's as borders, 4 as filler) compacted, removing top isolated 5's/3's and bottom strays; this looks like no effective cleanup, preserving noise.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing grid-based visual representations (likely pixel art or shape drawings with numbered "colors" or labels) to isolate and transform the main object or shape, such as cropping to a bounding box and padding to a square while preserving the internal structure. The goal appears to be extracting a central or primary visual element, possibly removing or adjusting borders/noise, but the current approach over-connects disparate elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use numbers (e.g., 3 for borders, 8/6/4/1/2 for internal shapes) to represent distinct visual elements; connectivity should likely be based on SAME value (4-connected or 8-connected) rather than any non-zero, as different numbers form separate "objects" (e.g., border vs. filled shapes).
 * The "main" object may not be the absolute largest component by cell count; it could be the largest SAME-value component, or one that forms a coherent shape (e.g., ignoring thin borders or noise); in examples, borders (3s or 4s/5s) seem partially retained but adjusted.
 * Bounding box extraction must tightly fit the selected component without including extraneous zeros or adjacent but unrelated numbers; padding to square should center the content but examples show irregular padding or shifts (e.g., uneven top/bottom rows).
 * Subtleties include handling disconnected parts of the same number (e.g., if border has gaps, it might split into multiple components); possible need to merge or select specific components (e.g., non-border shapes); outputs preserve number values but rearrange or omit parts, suggesting not pure cropping but transformation (e.g., removing outer frame or normalizing orientation).
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs are not always square-padded identically (e.g., train 1 expected has asymmetric 3s in top/bottom rows); grids may have implicit backgrounds (0s) that need trimming precisely; test input has a near-symmetric 3-frame with central 4, but output might need to isolate the 4 or adjust the frame.
 * Consider orientation/rotation: Train 3 expected swaps row patterns from generated, suggesting possible need to normalize (e.g., rotate to match a standard top-left).
 * All examples show multi-object scenes (border + internals); solution must identify "primary" via rules like size, position (central), or type (non-border).

                    if (cr, cc) in visited:
                        continue

    n = max(h, w)
    pad_top = (n - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = n - h - pad_top
    pad_left = (n - w) // 2
    pad_right = n - w - pad_left
    padded = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            padded[pad_top + i][pad_left + j] = grid[i][j]
    return padded
```
(Bounding box, subgrid extraction, and centered square padding are helpful and mostly correct for cropping/isolating; they work well if fed the right component, but current selection fails.)

```python
def select_largest_component(components: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not components:
        return []
    return max(components, key=len)
```
(This selector is helpful but incomplete; may need to filter by value (e.g., ignore border number like 3) or position (e.g., central component) instead of just size.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses 8-connected components on any non-zero cells, which merges borders (e.g., 3s) with internals (e.g., 8s/6s), leading to oversized bounding boxes that include unwanted parts; this fails all training examples by producing bloated or misaligned outputs.
 * Train 1: Generated includes full border+internals in bounding box, resulting in mismatched positions (e.g., row 0 has 3 at col 2/4 vs. expected col 3/10; row 2 has extra 3s and wrong 8 placements; bottom row has scattered 0s vs. expected 3s at col 5/7); padding centers but doesn't match expected asymmetries (unknown why, possibly due to over-inclusion).
 * Train 2: Generated mishandles internal shapes (e.g., row 3 has 3s/4s in wrong spots like extra 3 at col1/2 vs. expected 0s; row 4 has 5 at col0 but expected 5 at col0 with shifted 3s; overall, border 5s are preserved but internals like 3s/4s are distorted, likely from merged components).
 * Train 3: Generated outputs the full grid with border 4s and internals 1/2, but expected reorders rows (e.g., starts with [0,4,0,...] vs. generated [4,0,4,...], suggesting rotation or row swap needed; internals like 2s are in wrong bounding box, e.g., row4 has 1 at col2 vs. expected different; border seems flipped).
 * Function `find_all_components` is broken for this puzzle (connects different numbers; don't use as-is; modify for same-value).
 * Function `select_largest_component` is not helpful alone (picks overall largest, which is often the border, but puzzle may want internal shapes; consider alternatives like max per value).
 * No omission of small/noise components (e.g., single 4s); no handling for multiple same-value components (e.g., split borders).
 * Padding works but interacts badly with wrong bounding boxes, causing shifts (e.g., train 1 bottom row misalignment).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to crop/pad a near-full view of the input (7x7 frame of 3s with central 4 at row3 col3), but it includes the entire border without isolation, resulting in a symmetric frame that retains all non-zeros; this does not look correct because training examples suggest internals (like the 4) should be emphasized or border adjusted (e.g., gaps filled or border trimmed), and the output has redundant 0s at bottom-right that might need tightening.
 * Compared to input, output adds no major changes but fails to "extract" (e.g., if puzzle wants just the 4 shape padded, this overincludes 3s; if border is noise, it should be removed); asymmetries in input (e.g., bottom row 0s) are preserved but may need normalization.
 * Does not match expected patterns from training (e.g., no row swaps or value-specific cropping); likely incorrect as it would fail similarly to train cases by merging 3s+4 into one component.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract the core non-zero content (likely representing shapes, patterns, or "objects" made of numbers like 3,5,6,8) from an input grid, crop it to its minimal bounding rectangle, and then center that rectangle within a square output grid sized to the maximum of the bounding box's height or width, padding the rest with zeros. The centering must be symmetric (equal padding on opposite sides) to preserve the visual alignment, and the extraction must ignore leading/trailing empty rows/columns but include internal empty spaces as part of the content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main content is defined by the minimal bounding box enclosing all non-zero cells, not just the longest consecutive non-zero rows—internal zero rows/columns within the content must be preserved, but leading/trailing empty rows/columns should be trimmed.
 * Padding for centering must be symmetric: for rows, pad equally top and bottom with (n - h) // 2 on top and the remainder on bottom; for columns, pad equally left and right with (n - w) // 2 on left and remainder on right. Asymmetric padding (e.g., all extra on one side) distorts the visual center.
 * Grids may have scattered non-zero elements that form distinct "objects" or patterns (e.g., borders, shapes like letters or symbols), but the puzzle focuses on the central/primary pattern, potentially ignoring outliers if they don't connect to the main structure—however, all examples suggest including everything in the bounding box without omission.
 * Output size n = max(h, w) of the bounding box, and the entire grid is n x n; if the input is empty or all zeros, output an empty list or zero grid.
 * Subtlety: Row and column ranges must be computed across the entire grid for min/max positions of non-zeros, not assuming consecutiveness—gaps inside the bounding box are okay, but the box must be tight (no extra empty space outside).
 * Numbers represent distinct "colors" or types (e.g., 3 for outlines, 6 for fills), so they must be preserved exactly without alteration.
 * Potential for multiple disconnected components: Examples suggest treating the whole non-zero area as one, but if there are separate objects (e.g., in train2 with 5s as borders), the bounding box should encompass all relevant ones without fragmenting.
 * Edge cases: Odd/even dimensions for padding (use floor division and distribute remainder), all-zero inputs, or asymmetric shapes where w != h.
 * No rotation, scaling, or interpretation of numbers as logic (e.g., no summing or boolean ops)—pure geometric extraction and centering.

The main `program` function integrates the above but has bugs: it uses asymmetric horizontal padding (`pad_left = n - w if n > w else 0`, which left-aligns instead of centers) and relies on consecutive rows (causing missed or extra rows). No function for full-grid min/max bounding box (e.g., global min_r/max_r across all non-zeros) is present, which would be more robust.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt partially understands bounding box extraction (identifies row ranges and column mins/maxes) but fails on non-consecutive rows (e.g., assumes longest streak, missing internal gaps in train1 and train3).
 * What worked: Correctly computes column bounds within rows (preserves internal structure); outputs square grids of appropriate size; preserves exact numbers without alteration.
 * What didn't work: Row range selection is too restrictive (consecutive only), leading to cropped or shifted content (e.g., train1 generated starts too early with extra 3s in row 0 and misplaces bottom rows; train2 generated shifts inner patterns left/up, mismatching 3s and 4s positions; train3 generated flips or reorders border patterns incorrectly).
 * Padding is broken: Horizontal padding is left-aligned (not centered), causing right-side mismatches (e.g., in train1 generated, 3s and 8s hug left while expected has balanced spacing; train2 generated has 5s borders not symmetrically placed).
 * No handling for full-grid bounding box: All examples show the need to find global min_r/max_r/c by scanning all non-zeros, not just consecutive—train1 expected includes rows with sparse non-zeros (e.g., row 0 has isolated 3s, row 12 has sparse 3s).
 * Function `get_main_row_range` is flawed/not fully helpful (breaks on gapped content; don't rely on it without modification to find overall min/max row with any non-zero).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components via flood fill) attempted, but may not be needed—examples suggest simple bounding box suffices, though train2/3 have border-like 5s/4s that might need inclusion as frames.
 * Train1: Generated has incorrect top row (includes 3s/8s where expected is mostly zeros with one 3); bottom row has extra 3s; internal rows shifted (e.g., row 2 generated has 8s in wrong cols vs expected). Difference: Over-inclusive row range and left-shift.
 * Train2: Generated row1 has 3 where expected all zeros except bottom; row3 has 3s/4s misplaced (e.g., col1=3 but expected col1=0); row4 has extra 3s. Difference: Failed to trim top empty rows properly, shifted content up/left (unknown why 4s cluster differently, possibly wrong col min).
 * Train3: Generated borders are interleaved wrong (e.g., row0 starts with 4 but expected row0 all zeros except borders; row2 has 1s in wrong places). Difference: Completely reordered rows, suggesting row range miscomputed (consecutive logic failed on alternating pattern).
 * All trains mismatched shapes subtly (e.g., 6s/8s blobs deformed), likely from incorrect cropping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it produces a 13x13 grid with the main pattern (3s,4s,5s forming a cross or frame) but shifted severely left/up, with massive zero padding only on bottom/right (e.g., rows 0-2/10-12 all zeros, columns 10-12 sparse), and the 5s borders are not symmetric (hug left with 5s in cols 0-1/11-12 unevenly).
 * It fails to center: The content spans ~rows 3-8, cols 3-9 in generated, but expected should trim to tight box (likely rows ~3-8, cols ~3-9, h=6,w=7,n=7) then pad equally (e.g., 0.5 top/bottom, 0 left/right rounded), resulting in balanced 7x7 embedded in 13x13? Wait, test input seems 13x13 with content in middle, but generated over-pads asymmetrically.
 * Missing tight bounding: Generated includes extra empty rows (e.g., row3 has isolated 3s but full zeros elsewhere), inflating h/w; 4 in center is preserved but offset (row6 col6=4, but should be centered).
 * Does not make sense visually: The pattern looks like a malformed "H" or plus sign squished left, whereas correct should be perfectly centered with equal zero margins all around (e.g., 2-3 zeros top/bottom/left/right based on n=13).
 * To handle test: Need global min/max row/col scan (e.g., find first/last non-zero row/col overall), then center with symmetric pads; account for sparse borders (5s as frame) without cropping them out.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored pixels (represented by integers like 3, 5, 6, 8) where the task is to identify and extract the "main" object—likely a composite shape formed by nearby connected components of the same or different colors—then rotate it to a canonical orientation (e.g., upright) based on color cues, and output the rotated grid with the object centered or aligned in a minimal bounding box, omitting extraneous pixels or noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent pixels of the exact same color; different colors do not connect directly, but "meta-components" group nearby components (via centroid distance) to form composite objects.
 * The "main" object is the largest meta-component by total pixel count, ignoring smaller isolated blobs or noise (e.g., stray pixels or small groups).
 * Rotation is determined by specific "cue" colors in the main object: presence of 5 triggers clockwise (cw) rotation, 1 triggers counterclockwise (ccw), otherwise default to 180-degree rotation; this seems to "unrotate" the object based on asymmetric markers.
 * After extraction, pixels are shifted relative to the aggregate bounding box (bbox) minimums, rotated in the new orientation (which may swap height/width for 90-degree rotations), and placed in a new grid of the rotated dimensions; zeros fill the rest, but the output should match the expected shape, size, and positioning exactly.
 * Subtleties include: threshold for meta-grouping (e.g., 5.5 units via Euclidean distance on centroids) must be tuned to capture intended composites without merging unrelated parts; bbox computation uses min/max rows/columns across grouped components; rotations must handle coordinate transformations precisely (e.g., cw: new_row = old_col, new_col = new_width-1 - old_row_offset) to avoid off-by-one errors or flipped placements.
 * Outputs are lists of lists (rows), with exact dimensions and pixel placements matching expectations; extraneous rows/columns of zeros or misaligned shapes indicate failure.
 * Noise omission is key—small components (e.g., single pixels or tiny blobs) should be ignored unless part of the main meta-group.
 * Color sets drive decisions but only for rotation; all colors in the main group are preserved post-rotation.
 * Edge cases: rotated grids may change aspect ratio (h↔w for cw/ccw); 180-degree keeps dimensions but inverts positions; if no main object, return minimal empty grid.
 * Potential pitfalls: centroid approximation via bbox center may inaccurately group if shapes are irregular; stack-based flood fill must mark visited correctly to avoid infinite loops or missed pixels.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies connected components and meta-grouping via proximity, which works well for composite objects (as seen in training example 3 passing).
 * Rotation detection via color cues (5 for cw, 1 for ccw, else 180) is a core principle that aligns with puzzle asymmetry, but fails when cues are absent or misdetected (e.g., training 1 defaults to 180 but placements are off).
 * Extraction of largest meta-component by pixel count effectively omits noise in cases like training 3, but in training 1, it includes too much or misaligns the bbox, leading to partial shape matches.
 * Threshold of 5.5 for meta-grouping works for some densities (training 3) but may be too loose/tight for others, causing over-merging or under-grouping (e.g., training 2 scatters pixels instead of compacting).
 * Centroid-based bbox centers approximate well for symmetric blobs but may err on irregular shapes, contributing to incorrect distances in training 1 and 2.
 * Pixel extraction and rotation application preserve colors and positions mostly correctly, but coordinate transforms have off-by-one or inversion issues (e.g., training 1 generated first row [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]—3's shifted right; last row [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0]—misplaced and wrong count).
 * In training 2, generated a sparse 15x15-ish grid with isolated pixels (e.g., row 0: [0,3,0,0,...]; row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]) vs compact 10x10 expected (e.g., row 0: [5,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5])—failed to group/rotate into dense shape, possibly due to poor meta-detection or wrong rotation (colors include 5, so cw attempted but dimensions wrong: generated tall/thin vs expected square-ish).
 * Training 1 mismatches blob shapes in rows 0,1,6,12 (unknown reason—possibly bbox shift or rotation not inverting fully; 3's and 6's positions swapped or flipped incorrectly).
 * Training 2 omits consolidation, leaving unrotated fragments (e.g., 5's and 3's not aligned into expected borders).
 * The main program orchestrates well but bbox computation and rotation placement need tighter offset handling (e.g., no padding added; exact min_r/min_c subtraction).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all provided are relevant, though rotation may need validation for edge cases like zero-height/width.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x10 grid with vertical 5's on the left (rows 1-2,4-9), horizontal 3's in the middle forming a shape with a 4 inset (row 6 col 6), and bottom 3's— it looks like a partial frame or letter-like shape, but density feels low (many zeros) and asymmetric, suggesting incomplete grouping or wrong rotation.
 * It does not look fully correct: the 5's form a sparse column, 3's a loose blob with 4 inside, but if the puzzle expects a rotated/aligned compact object (e.g., cw since 5 present), this may be pre-rotation or mis-extracted; expected likely denser (like training 2's compact form) with 5's repositioned to borders, 4 centered, and no stray zeros in a minimal bbox.
 * Differences from intuition: positions like 4 at (6,6) seem arbitrary; if cw rotation was applied, 5's should map horizontally—current verticality suggests either no rotation triggered or transform failed; overall, it resembles unprocessed input more than a "solved" upright object, missing the consolidation seen in correct training 3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify and extract the primary "object" or structure from a noisy grid by detecting connected components of the same color, grouping nearby components into meta-structures based on centroid proximity, selecting the largest such group, applying a rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) if specific marker colors (like 5 or 1) are present, and then padding the result to a centered square grid. The output should represent a cleaned, possibly rotated, and squared version of the main visual element, ignoring isolated or small extraneous parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components use 4-way (up, down, left, right) adjacency for same-color pixels; diagonal connections are not considered, which can split shapes if diagonals are involved.
 * Meta-grouping relies on a fixed distance threshold (5.5 units) between component centroids to connect nearby blobs, treating them as part of one object; this threshold may be too loose or tight for varying grid scales, leading to over- or under-grouping.
 * The largest meta-group is selected by total pixel count, assuming it represents the "main" object; this works if noise is smaller but fails if multiple large structures exist or if the main one is fragmented.
 * Rotation is determined solely by the presence of specific colors (5 for clockwise, 1 for counterclockwise, default none); this is a simple rule but ignores orientation hints from shape or position, and the rotation formulas (e.g., cw: nr=sc, nc=new_w-1-sr) must handle bounding box correctly without clipping.
 * Padding centers the content in the smallest square that fits the max dimension, using zeros; this assumes the output size is determined post-rotation, but subtleties include integer division for offsets ((n - h)//2) which can cause slight off-centering if dimensions are odd.
 * Grids can have varying sizes (e.g., 13x13 for train1, 10x10 expected for train2), and outputs must match exactly, including zeros; extraneous pixels or wrong sizes indicate failures in component selection or bounding.
 * Colors represent distinct "parts" (e.g., 3 might be background/structure, 8/6 internal details, 5/1 rotation cues, 4 special elements); preserving exact positions and values during extraction/rotation is critical.
 * Potential noise includes isolated pixels or small clusters outside the main object, which the meta-grouping aims to exclude, but if the threshold merges noise incorrectly, it pollutes the output.
 * Rotation only applies if cw/ccw is detected, but the code includes an unused '180' option; ensure no clipping occurs post-rotation, as dimensions swap (h becomes w).
 * For square padding, the new grid size n = max(height, width) post-rotation; if input is empty or all zeros, default to [[0]].
 * Subtle: Centroids use bounding box center ((min+max)/2), not true geometric center, which approximates for irregular shapes but may misalign grouping distance.
 * The program assumes rows=0 implies empty, and handles empty components gracefully, but fails if all components are small or if colors trigger wrong rotation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The component detection and meta-grouping worked partially, as evidenced by train3 being correct, correctly isolating and combining nearby blobs into a main structure.
 * Selection of largest meta-component succeeded in train3 but failed in train1 and train2, likely including extraneous small clusters (e.g., isolated 3s) due to loose threshold, leading to polluted outputs.
 * Rotation detection and application worked in cases without rotation (or correct markers) like possibly train3, but in train1, it seems to have misapplied or not rotated, causing positional mismatches (e.g., generated has 3s in row0 cols2/4 vs expected cols3/10; extra 3s in row12; misplaced 8s and 6s in rows 2-10).
 * In train1, generated output included border-like 3s that don't match expected (e.g., expected has asymmetric 3s in row0 and row12, with a single 3 in row12 col6; generated has symmetric but wrong extras), suggesting over-grouping of background 3s or failure to exclude noise.
 * Train2 generated a malformed 15x15-ish grid with scattered elements (e.g., isolated 4 in row3, fragmented 5s and 3s) vs expected compact 10x10 with structured 5-frame, 3-body, and internal 4; this indicates broken bbox calculation or padding, plus wrong meta-selection (total pixels likely split across groups).
 * Padding to square worked in structure but failed on size in train2 (generated larger than expected 10x10), and in train1 caused slight shifts due to incorrect pre-pad content.
 * Centroid-based distance (threshold 5.5) is helpful but too aggressive in train1 (merged distant 3s) and too conservative in train2 (failed to group 5s into frame).
 * determine_rotation is simplistic and likely correct for marker presence, but train1 expected seems unrotated while generated has anomalies possibly from partial rotation.
 * Overall program flow (components -> meta -> select -> pixels/bbox/colors -> rotate -> pad) is solid core but breaks on noisy inputs; train3 passed likely due to clean/simple structure.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though apply_rotation's '180' branch is unused and could be removed to avoid confusion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x10 grid forming a rough frame of 5s (top/bottom rows partial, sides sparse) with internal 3s in a cross-like or body shape and a single 4 in row6 col6, which visually resembles a structured object (possibly a rotated figure with marker 5s indicating cw rotation).
 * It makes partial sense as an extracted/rotated main structure (5s as rotation cues grouped with 3s body and 4 detail), but without the expected output, it's hard to confirm; however, the sparse 5s on edges and centered 3s/4 suggest correct meta-grouping and padding, unlike train2's mess—likely correct if the input had similar noise.
 * Differences from expectations (mentally simulating): If input has scattered 5s as cues, 3s as main body, and 4 internal, this output cleans it well, but subtle mismatches could occur if rotation was wrong (e.g., 4 position might be flipped) or if threshold missed a 3-fragment; overall, it looks more correct than train1/2 outputs, with no obvious extras or size issues.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 12:25:30] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract the "main" figure from a grid of colored pixels (likely representing a scene or object composed of multiple connected components), group nearby components into a cohesive whole, optionally rotate it 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise based on the presence of specific marker colors (like 5 for CW or 1 for CCW), and then center the result in a padded square grid of appropriate size. The output should be a clean, compact representation of the figure without extraneous noise or disconnected elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are identified using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count, which can lead to fragmented blobs if not handled.
 * "Main" figure is determined by grouping components via a meta-graph based on centroid proximity (e.g., Euclidean distance < threshold like 6.0), then selecting the group with the highest total pixel count; this handles multi-part objects but can fail if the threshold is too loose (includes noise) or too tight (splits the figure).
 * Rotation is triggered by specific colors in the extracted pixels: 5 indicates clockwise 90-degree rotation, 1 indicates counterclockwise 90-degree, and absence defaults to none; rotations must correctly remap coordinates (e.g., CW: new_row = old_col, new_col = new_width - 1 - old_row) and adjust bounding box dimensions (height becomes width and vice versa).
 * After extraction and rotation, the figure is cropped to its minimal bounding box, then padded to the smallest square that centers it (using integer division for offsets); padding must be symmetric and not distort the figure.
 * Grids may have irregular sizes and scattered noise (isolated pixels or small components), so filtering out small or distant components is crucial to avoid including background elements.
 * Expected outputs are often compact and square (or near-square after padding), with no empty rows/columns in the core figure; mismatches often occur in pixel placements due to incorrect grouping, rotation, or padding offsets.
 * Subtle element: Colors represent distinct parts (e.g., 3 for outline, 8 for fill, 6 for details, 4/5 for markers), and the puzzle preserves original color values without remapping.
 * Bounding box calculations must use min/max rows/columns from positions only after selecting the main group to avoid including the full input grid.
 * For rotation, ensure out-of-bounds pixels are clipped (set to 0), and handle cases where h != w correctly swaps dimensions.
 * Test inputs may have vertical/horizontal symmetries or markers in corners, requiring precise centroid calculations to group correctly.
 * Empty or zero-pixel outputs default to a single [0], but real figures should fill a meaningful area.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program (last submission) correctly identifies connected components and groups them via meta-graph, which worked for training example 3 (produced correct compact output, likely due to proper proximity and rotation handling in that case).
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a 13x13 grid with misplaced pixels—e.g., extra 3s in row 0 and row 12, incorrect 8/6 placements in rows 2-10 (like 8s shifted left in row 2, missing 8s in row 10 col 11, and 6s not aligned); expected has different symmetries (e.g., 3s in row 0 cols 3/10, 8 in row 10 col 9 missing in generated); likely due to over-grouping noise or incorrect rotation/padding offsets, resulting in distorted figure.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a sparse 15x15 grid with isolated/scattered 3/4/5 pixels across rows 4-14 (e.g., single 4 in row 3, fragmented 5s and 3s not forming shapes), while expected is a compact 10x10 figure with connected 3/4/5 blobs (e.g., solid 5 borders, central 4 triangle, 3 details); failure in meta-grouping (threshold too high/low, including noise or missing connections) and no rotation applied, leading to uncompacted, oversized output.
 * Training example 3 (CORRECT): No specific output shown, but succeeded, suggesting core component extraction and selection worked when the figure was tightly grouped without rotation needs.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates understanding of component finding and largest-group selection but fails on rotation application (e.g., coordinate remapping errors) and threshold tuning for diverse layouts; padding works but amplifies errors from prior steps.
 * Function `find_components` is helpful and correct for blob isolation.
 * Functions like `build_meta_graph`, `find_meta_components`, and `select_largest_meta` are essential for handling multi-part figures but need threshold adjustment (e.g., 6.0 may be too permissive for train2).
 * `determine_rotation` and `apply_rotation` are useful but brittle—misses cases without 1/5, and CCW mapping may have off-by-one errors in bounding.
 * `pad_to_square` is correct and helpful for final centering.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but the integrated `program` wrapper ties them together effectively for most cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (13x13 grid) does not look correct: it has redundant empty rows (e.g., full row 2 of 0s, duplicated rows 0/1 and 12/13 with sparse 5s), a fragmented figure with 3s/4/5 not forming a cohesive shape (e.g., isolated 4 in row 6 col 6, 5 borders broken in rows 4-9, 3 clusters scattered), and oversized padding that doesn't center tightly; expected should be a compact square (likely 9x9 or 10x10 based on visible elements) with connected 3 (body), 4 (detail), and 5 (marker/border) forming a rotated/coherent object, similar to train2's expected density—current output includes noise and fails grouping/rotation, making it look like unprocessed input rather than extracted figure.

[2025-10-02 12:25:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
