=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 23:25:27] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:38:51] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to propagate fills (replacing background 8s with 3s) starting from a seed position marked by a 3, guided by lines or segments of 2s (which seem to represent paths, walls, or propagation guides) in either a vertical-dominant mode or a horizontal-dominant mode, while treating 1s as equivalent to 2s for propagation purposes. The rules involve detecting the mode based on the seed row's layout, then filling vertical and horizontal segments accordingly, potentially connecting or extending based on distances, lengths, and boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses numbers with specific meanings: 1s are treated as 2s (likely temporary or alias markers), 2s are propagation guides (e.g., lines that direct filling), 3 is the seed start and final fill target, 8 is background to be filled.
 * Mode detection is critical: vertical mode if there's a 2 to the right of the seed in the seed row; otherwise horizontal. This is a subtle binary choice that branches the entire logic.
 * In vertical mode, filling involves finding the nearest right 2-column with vertical extension below seed, computing lengths (e.g., num_8s as vertical span), then filling left/right horizontals from seed row, verticals at computed columns (left_v, right_v), and a connecting horizontal at the bottom (BACKGROUND=8, but capped to grid size).
 * In horizontal mode, it's more complex: scan rows below seed for horizontal segments of 2s (at least length 2), project vertical fills downward from seed or prior horizontals based on distance to segment edges (closer side, with edge cases for boundaries), cap heights to avoid overlapping segments, fill horizontals at computed heights (potentially full BACKGROUND width or adjusted), and update position (current_c) for chaining segments; ends with a final vertical drop.
 * Subtleties: BACKGROUND=8 is used both as a value and a conceptual full-width/length (e.g., hor_end=BACKGROUND means fill to grid edge); edge cases handle out-of-bounds (e.g., clamp to 0 or cols_n-1); vertical spans are computed as min distances but overridden in edge cases to full segment length; fills only overwrite 8s, preserving 2s and 3s; chaining in horizontal mode requires tracking previous_h and updating current_c toward the "far" edge.
 * Key missable elements: In vertical mode, right_red_col requires a 2 *below* s in columns > left_red_col (not just in seed row); horizontal segments must be contiguous 2s of len>=2; vertical fills in horizontal mode are capped before the segment row (h = r-1); final vertical in horizontal mode goes to bottom from last previous_h+1; no filling above seed or left of col=0.
 * General considerations: Grid is rectangular (rows_n x cols_n); seed is unique (first 3 found); if no seed, return unchanged; propagation doesn't cross or overwrite non-8s; potential for incomplete chaining if segments don't overlap seed column projection.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Ensure mode detection doesn't false-positive (e.g., any 2 to right triggers vertical); handle long vertical 2-lines that span multiple rows; in horizontal, closer_dist logic might underfill if segments are asymmetric; BACKGROUND as 8 is confusing—it's both a cell value and a max extent proxy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional

def replace_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Helpful: Preprocess by aliasing 1s to 2s for uniform guide treatment."""
    return [[2 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]

def find_seed(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Helpful: Locates the unique starting 3 position (row, col). Returns None if absent."""
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 3:
                return i, j
    return None

def is_vertical_mode(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    """Helpful: Checks seed row for any 2 to the right of seed col, triggering vertical branch."""
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c + 1, len(grid[0])))
```

```python
# Note: vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are core but have bugs (see below); useful as skeletons.
# No custom types defined, but Tuple[int, int] for positions and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for segments (row, start_col, end_col) in horizontal mode are helpful for structuring.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid base logic for simpler cases (likely shorter grids or straightforward vertical/horizontal propagations without chaining or edge cases).
 * What worked: replace_ones and find_seed are reliable; mode detection works for training (e.g., correctly branches to vertical or horizontal); basic filling overwrites only 8s and preserves 2s/3s; vertical mode's left/right red col detection and num_8s span computation succeed in training.
 * What didn't work: In horizontal mode (likely used for test), segment detection misses or under-chains—e.g., it only filled a single vertical in col25 from row7 down and no horizontals, ignoring multiple 2-lines (verticals in col1 rows0-5, col7 rows6-13, col17 throughout?); closer_dist and edge_case logic may miscompute length_v or hor_start/end, leading to no horizontal fills; final vertical only partial (to row13, but grid has 14 rows?); current_c updating fails to propagate across segments, stopping early.
 * vertical_fill has issues: right_red_col search is overly restrictive (requires 2 below s, but may miss if no vertical below); connect_end computation uses right_red_col - left_v, which could be negative or wrong if num_8s skews; fills right horizontal from right_start (clamped) but may over/under-extend.
 * horizontal_fill is broken/incomplete: segments list only captures len>=2 horizontals below s, but test has vertical 2s (not horizontals?), so no segments found? j loop in segment detection assumes horizontal runs, but if 2s are vertical, it skips; is_first logic and previous_h tracking untested on multi-segment; hor_start/end uses BACKGROUND=8 directly (e.g., hor_end=8), but if cols_n >8, it underfills; edge_case overrides to full l but only if boundary hit.
 * No extract_objects function present or needed—puzzle is fill-propagation, not object extraction (don't pursue object-based approaches).
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of seed/mode but fails on complex test geometry (multiple disjoint vertical 2-lines, possibly needing horizontal interpretation as segments or mode misdetect).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x26 grid (inferred from list lengths) with unchanged 2s in approximate positions: vertical line of 2s in col1 rows0-5, another in col7 rows6-13, and col17 throughout all rows (based on repeated [...,2,...] patterns); only fills 3s in col25 (last column?) from row7 to row13 (7 cells), with no other 3s except the original seed (implied at bottom-right-ish).
 * This does not look correct: Expected full propagation would likely fill more 8s into 3s, e.g., horizontals connecting the 2-lines (like bridging col1 to col7 to col17), vertical drops from seed, or full spans in vertical mode; instead, it's minimal (only one short vertical fill), leaving most 8s untouched—suggests horizontal mode triggered but no segments detected (test 2s are vertical, not horizontal runs, so segments=[] and only final vertical from some default previous_h).
 * Observed effect: Partial fill only at bottom-right vertical (col25 rows7-13 as 3s), but seed seems lower (row6+ has 2 in col25? print ends with 3s there); differs from expected by not chaining across the three vertical 2-lines (e.g., no horizontal at row5 connecting col1 to col7, no extension to col17); unknown why col25 specifically (perhaps default BACKGROUND=8 misread as col); no horizontals at all, despite code attempting them.
 * Test likely needs better segment detection for vertical 2s (treat as horizontal proj? or mode error); output ignores upper 2s entirely, suggesting start_v computation wrong or is_first skips.

```python
# Note: vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are core but have bugs (see below); useful as skeletons.
# No custom types defined, but Tuple[int, int] for positions and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for segments (row, start_col, end_col) in horizontal mode are helpful for structuring.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid base logic for simpler cases (likely shorter grids or straightforward vertical/horizontal propagations without chaining or edge cases).
 * What worked: replace_ones and find_seed are reliable; mode detection works for training (e.g., correctly branches to vertical or horizontal); basic filling overwrites only 8s and preserves 2s/3s; vertical mode's left/right red col detection and num_8s span computation succeed in training.
 * What didn't work: In horizontal mode (likely used for test), segment detection misses or under-chains—e.g., it only filled a single vertical in col25 from row7 down and no horizontals, ignoring multiple 2-lines (verticals in col1 rows0-5, col7 rows6-13, col17 throughout?); closer_dist and edge_case logic may miscompute length_v or hor_start/end, leading to no horizontal fills; final vertical only partial (to row13, but grid has 14 rows?); current_c updating fails to propagate across segments, stopping early.
 * vertical_fill has issues: right_red_col search is overly restrictive (requires 2 below s, but may miss if no vertical below); connect_end computation uses right_red_col - left_v, which could be negative or wrong if num_8s skews; fills right horizontal from right_start (clamped) but may over/under-extend.
 * horizontal_fill is broken/incomplete: segments list only captures len>=2 horizontals below s, but test has vertical 2s (not horizontals?), so no segments found? j loop in segment detection assumes horizontal runs, but if 2s are vertical, it skips; is_first logic and previous_h tracking untested on multi-segment; hor_start/end uses BACKGROUND=8 directly (e.g., hor_end=8), but if cols_n >8, it underfills; edge_case overrides to full l but only if boundary hit.
 * No extract_objects function present or needed—puzzle is fill-propagation, not object extraction (don't pursue object-based approaches).
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of seed/mode but fails on complex test geometry (multiple disjoint vertical 2-lines, possibly needing horizontal interpretation as segments or mode misdetect).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x26 grid (inferred from list lengths) with unchanged 2s in approximate positions: vertical line of 2s in col1 rows0-5, another in col7 rows6-13, and col17 throughout all rows (based on repeated [...,2,...] patterns); only fills 3s in col25 (last column?) from row7 to row13 (7 cells), with no other 3s except the original seed (implied at bottom-right-ish).
 * This does not look correct: Expected full propagation would likely fill more 8s into 3s, e.g., horizontals connecting the 2-lines (like bridging col1 to col7 to col17), vertical drops from seed, or full spans in vertical mode; instead, it's minimal (only one short vertical fill), leaving most 8s untouched—suggests horizontal mode triggered but no segments detected (test 2s are vertical, not horizontal runs, so segments=[] and only final vertical from some default previous_h).
 * Observed effect: Partial fill only at bottom-right vertical (col25 rows7-13 as 3s), but seed seems lower (row6+ has 2 in col25? print ends with 3s there); differs from expected by not chaining across the three vertical 2-lines (e.g., no horizontal at row5 connecting col1 to col7, no extension to col17); unknown why col25 specifically (perhaps default BACKGROUND=8 misread as col); no horizontals at all, despite code attempting them.
 * Test likely needs better segment detection for vertical 2s (treat as horizontal proj? or mode error); output ignores upper 2s entirely, suggesting start_v computation wrong or is_first skips.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-09-30 23:49:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a path-propagation puzzle on a grid where a seed cell (3) initiates filling of empty cells (8) with paths (3) in horizontal and vertical lines, guided by existing path segments (2), following rules for direction (right/left/down) based on nearby guides, with connections that alternate or extend based on distances and segment lengths below or around the seed row/column.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 8 for empty/fillable cells, 2 for pre-existing guide paths (which may be partial lines or segments), 3 for the seed starting point and filled paths; 1s are replaced by 2s early, suggesting they are initial guides.
 * Propagation starts from the seed (3) location; detect "vertical mode" if any 2s exist to the right of seed in the seed row (prioritizes rightward horizontal fill with vertical drops); otherwise check for left guides (2s to left in seed row or below) to propagate leftward; fallback to downward propagation if no left/right guides.
 * In right/left propagation: Identify guide columns with 2s below the seed row; for each guide, compute the vertical span of 2s below (below_start to below_end, length = below_len); if guide has 2 at seed row, fill horizontal 3s toward it (gap of at least 2 cells? from code: fill_end = guide_j - 2), then drop vertical 3s down matching below_len; if no 2 at seed row, infer distance (row_dist = below_start - seed_row) and fill horizontal extending to/from guide based on that dist, then vertical drop of row_dist length; track previous ends to avoid overlap, and connect inner vertical drops with horizontal at max_end_r +1.
 * In downward propagation: Scan rows below seed for horizontal segments of 2s (length >=2); sort by row; connect vertically from seed col down to first segment's row, choosing left or right horizontal shift based on closer side (l_dist/r_dist to segment ends, targets at col=1 left or 2*seed_col right, capped by grid); then alternate horizontal fills (full left-to-right target) at segment rows +1, with vertical fills in between and to bottom; direction flips per segment (base_dir * (-1)^(segment_index)).
 * Subtle: Fills only overwrite 8s (not 2s or existing 3s); vertical fills in right/left modes start from seed_row+1; connections at max_end_r+1 only if inner_cols exist and within bounds; in down mode, first horizontal is partial to closer side, subsequent are full spans; segments must be contiguous 2s >=2 long; no propagation if no guides/segments.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap prevention via previous_end tracking; vertical end calculations (e.g., v_end_r = s + v_length, but min with rows_n-1); in down mode, start_v for first segment is after first_h, for others after previous_end_v; potential for asymmetric fills (e.g., not full grid width); seed might not be filled if already 3, but code ensures it.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 19x19? for ex3, 12x19? for ex4, 14x26 for test); assume rectangular, non-empty.
 * All considerations: Mode detection must be precise (any 2 right -> vertical mode, overriding left/down); below_len includes only from first 2 down, but max over all; fills are inclusive ranges; no diagonal or other directions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional

def replace_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[2 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]  # Helpful: Standardizes initial guides (1->2), used in all attempts.

def find_seed(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 3:
                return i, j
    return None  # Helpful: Locates unique seed (3); assumes one seed.

def is_vertical_mode(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c + 1, len(grid[0])))  # Helpful: Detects rightward priority for horizontal+vertical prop.

def has_left_guide(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c))  # Helpful but limited: Only checks seed row left; code extends to below in prop, but detection is row-only—potential bug if below-left only.

def fill_line_vertical(grid: List[List[int]], col: int, start_row: int, end_row: int):
    rows_n = len(grid)
    for i in range(max(start_row, 0), min(end_row + 1, rows_n)):
        if grid[i][col] == 8:
            grid[i][col] = 3  # Helpful: Core filler for verticals, bounds-checked, only 8s.

def fill_line_horizontal(grid: List[List[int]], row: int, start_col: int, end_col: int):
    cols_n = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    for j in range(max(start_col, 0), min(end_col + 1, cols_n)):
        if grid[row][j] == 8:
            grid[row][j] = 3  # Helpful: Core filler for horizontals, bounds-checked, only 8s.

# propagate_right_in_row, propagate_left_in_row, propagate_down: Core logic functions—helpful but buggy in details (see attempts); include guide col finding, below span calc, dist-based fills, alternating/connecting.
# program: Main orchestrator—helpful structure (replace, find, mode detect, conditional prop, return grid).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly detected modes and filled paths matching expected, suggesting basic seed finding, mode detection, and simple prop (e.g., single-guide or basic down segments) function well.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated overfills or misplaces 3s—e.g., row8 has 3s from col1-7 (unexpected, expected only col1? Wait, expected row8 [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,...] no, looking: generated row8 [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] matches expected row14? Mismatch in row indexing? Actually, generated row9/10 have 3 only at col1 but expected at col1; row11 has 2s starting col4 with full 2s to end but expected 3 at col1 and 2s from col4; row14 matches expected row8 but shifted; row15/16 expected 8s at col1 but generated 3s; row17 expected 2s to col5 +8s but generated 2s to col5 +8s +3 at col8? Overall, seems like left/right prop miscalculated inner_cols or connections, filling wrong vertical drops (e.g., extra 3s in lower left, missing some in row11 left).
 * Training 4 incorrect: Generated extra 3s in row5 cols0-3 (expected only 0-2, col3=8); row6 [8,8,8,3,8,2,...] but expected [8,8,3,8,8,2,...] (3 shifted left); row7/8 similar shifts/misses (generated 3 at col3 row7/8, expected col2); row9 generated [8,8,3,3,3,...] but expected [8,8,3,8,8,...] no full horizontal; suggests down prop or left prop wrong on segment distances/closer side choice, overextending horizontals or wrong vertical aligns.
 * propagate_right_in_row buggy: In ex3, likely overfills right horizontals and wrong v_end_r (e.g., connects at wrong row11 with full 2s? But 2s are guides, code fills 3s on 8s only); previous_right_end not preventing overlap properly; in no-has_at_s case, fill_start = guide_j - row_dist may extend too far left.
 * propagate_left_in_row buggy: In ex3/ex4, fills wrong inner_col (e.g., starting too right/left), leading to misplaced verticals (ex3 row15/16 extra 3s at col1); previous_left_end min/max logic flips directions incorrectly.
 * propagate_down buggy: In ex4, wrong closer_dist/is_left_closer (fills extra in row5 left, shifts 3s in row6/7); alternating this_dir = base_dir * (-1)**(h_num-1) may flip too soon, causing partial/full horizontal mismatches; seg_r +2 for end_v too rigid (ex4 row9 overfills horizontal at row8+1?).
 * has_left_guide limited to seed row—misses below-left guides, forcing wrong down mode in some cases (potential for ex3/ex4).
 * No extraction functions for segments/guides beyond inline—would help debugging, e.g., def extract_segments_below(row_start): to list (r, start, end) for validation.
 * Overall, mode detection and basic fills work, but distance calcs, overlap prevention, and alternating connections fail on multi-guide/segment cases; no handling for guides at/near edges.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows vertical 2s in col1 rows0-5 and col7 row5-13? Wait, input not given but output has consistent 2s in col1 rows0-5, col17 rows0-5, col7 rows5-13, col17 rows5-10?, seed at row6 col9=3, then horizontal 3s in row6 from col9-17 (but overwrites? No, fills 8s to 3s, but then extra 3s after col17 2 in row6 cols18-25); row7-10 have 3 at col9 only (under seed), but then row7 col19=3? And row11 col19=3 but others 8; no vertical fills down from seed col9 beyond row6, and left/right props seem partial/missing (e.g., no connection horizontals lower); looks like right prop triggered (vertical mode? Assuming right 2s), but only filled one horizontal in seed row to right guide, no vertical drops or further guides processed (missing multi-guide logic), and spurious 3s in right side row7+ (e.g., col19 row7=3, perhaps wrong fill_start); down mode not triggered but if it were, no segments filled; overall underfills verticals/connections and overfills isolated 3s, doesn't connect left/right guides properly—likely same bugs as ex3/4 in prop functions.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a path-propagation puzzle on a grid where a seed cell (3) initiates filling of empty cells (8) with paths (3) in horizontal and vertical lines, guided by existing path segments (2), following rules for direction (right/left/down) based on nearby guides, with connections that alternate or extend based on distances and segment lengths below or around the seed row/column.

 * Subtle: Fills only overwrite 8s (not 2s or existing 3s); vertical fills in right/left modes start from seed_row+1; connections at max_end_r+1 only if inner_cols exist and within bounds; in down mode, first horizontal is partial to closer side, subsequent are full spans; segments must be contiguous 2s >=2 long; no propagation if no guides/segments.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap prevention via previous_end tracking; vertical end calculations (e.g., v_end_r = s + v_length, but min with rows_n-1); in down mode, start_v for first segment is after first_h, for others after previous_end_v; potential for asymmetric fills (e.g., not full grid width); seed might not be filled if already 3, but code ensures it.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 19x19? for ex3, 12x19? for ex4, 14x26 for test); assume rectangular, non-empty.
 * All considerations: Mode detection must be precise (any 2 right -> vertical mode, overriding left/down); below_len includes only from first 2 down, but max over all; fills are inclusive ranges; no diagonal or other directions.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly detected modes and filled paths matching expected, suggesting basic seed finding, mode detection, and simple prop (e.g., single-guide or basic down segments) function well.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated overfills or misplaces 3s—e.g., row8 has 3s from col1-7 (unexpected, expected only col1? Wait, expected row8 [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,...] no, looking: generated row8 [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] matches expected row14? Mismatch in row indexing? Actually, generated row9/10 have 3 only at col1 but expected at col1; row11 has 2s starting col4 with full 2s to end but expected 3 at col1 and 2s from col4; row14 matches expected row8 but shifted; row15/16 expected 8s at col1 but generated 3s; row17 expected 2s to col5 +8s but generated 2s to col5 +8s +3 at col8? Overall, seems like left/right prop miscalculated inner_cols or connections, filling wrong vertical drops (e.g., extra 3s in lower left, missing some in row11 left).
 * Training 4 incorrect: Generated extra 3s in row5 cols0-3 (expected only 0-2, col3=8); row6 [8,8,8,3,8,2,...] but expected [8,8,3,8,8,2,...] (3 shifted left); row7/8 similar shifts/misses (generated 3 at col3 row7/8, expected col2); row9 generated [8,8,3,3,3,...] but expected [8,8,3,8,8,...] no full horizontal; suggests down prop or left prop wrong on segment distances/closer side choice, overextending horizontals or wrong vertical aligns.
 * propagate_right_in_row buggy: In ex3, likely overfills right horizontals and wrong v_end_r (e.g., connects at wrong row11 with full 2s? But 2s are guides, code fills 3s on 8s only); previous_right_end not preventing overlap properly; in no-has_at_s case, fill_start = guide_j - row_dist may extend too far left.
 * propagate_left_in_row buggy: In ex3/ex4, fills wrong inner_col (e.g., starting too right/left), leading to misplaced verticals (ex3 row15/16 extra 3s at col1); previous_left_end min/max logic flips directions incorrectly.
 * propagate_down buggy: In ex4, wrong closer_dist/is_left_closer (fills extra in row5 left, shifts 3s in row6/7); alternating this_dir = base_dir * (-1)**(h_num-1) may flip too soon, causing partial/full horizontal mismatches; seg_r +2 for end_v too rigid (ex4 row9 overfills horizontal at row8+1?).
 * has_left_guide limited to seed row—misses below-left guides, forcing wrong down mode in some cases (potential for ex3/ex4).
 * No extraction functions for segments/guides beyond inline—would help debugging, e.g., def extract_segments_below(row_start): to list (r, start, end) for validation.
 * Overall, mode detection and basic fills work, but distance calcs, overlap prevention, and alternating connections fail on multi-guide/segment cases; no handling for guides at/near edges.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows vertical 2s in col1 rows0-5 and col7 row5-13? Wait, input not given but output has consistent 2s in col1 rows0-5, col17 rows0-5, col7 rows5-13, col17 rows5-10?, seed at row6 col9=3, then horizontal 3s in row6 from col9-17 (but overwrites? No, fills 8s to 3s, but then extra 3s after col17 2 in row6 cols18-25); row7-10 have 3 at col9 only (under seed), but then row7 col19=3? And row11 col19=3 but others 8; no vertical fills down from seed col9 beyond row6, and left/right props seem partial/missing (e.g., no connection horizontals lower); looks like right prop triggered (vertical mode? Assuming right 2s), but only filled one horizontal in seed row to right guide, no vertical drops or further guides processed (missing multi-guide logic), and spurious 3s in right side row7+ (e.g., col19 row7=3, perhaps wrong fill_start); down mode not triggered but if it were, no segments filled; overall underfills verticals/connections and overfills isolated 3s, doesn't connect left/right guides properly—likely same bugs as ex3/4 in prop functions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to propagate fills (replacing background 8s with 3s) starting from a seed position marked by a 3, guided by lines or segments of 2s (which seem to represent paths, walls, or propagation guides) in either a vertical-dominant mode or a horizontal-dominant mode, while treating 1s as equivalent to 2s for propagation purposes. The rules involve detecting the mode based on the seed row's layout, then filling vertical and horizontal segments accordingly, potentially connecting or extending based on distances, lengths, and boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses numbers with specific meanings: 1s are treated as 2s (likely temporary or alias markers), 2s are propagation guides (e.g., lines that direct filling), 3 is the seed start and final fill target, 8 is background to be filled.
 * Mode detection is critical: vertical mode if there's a 2 to the right of the seed in the seed row; otherwise horizontal. This is a subtle binary choice that branches the entire logic.
 * In vertical mode, filling involves finding the nearest right 2-column with vertical extension below seed, computing lengths (e.g., num_8s as vertical span), then filling left/right horizontals from seed row, verticals at computed columns (left_v, right_v), and a connecting horizontal at the bottom (BACKGROUND=8, but capped to grid size).
 * In horizontal mode, it's more complex: scan rows below seed for horizontal segments of 2s (at least length 2), project vertical fills downward from seed or prior horizontals based on distance to segment edges (closer side, with edge cases for boundaries), cap heights to avoid overlapping segments, fill horizontals at computed heights (potentially full BACKGROUND width or adjusted), and update position (current_c) for chaining segments; ends with a final vertical drop.
 * Subtleties: BACKGROUND=8 is used both as a value and a conceptual full-width/length (e.g., hor_end=BACKGROUND means fill to grid edge); edge cases handle out-of-bounds (e.g., clamp to 0 or cols_n-1); vertical spans are computed as min distances but overridden in edge cases to full segment length; fills only overwrite 8s, preserving 2s and 3s; chaining in horizontal mode requires tracking previous_h and updating current_c toward the "far" edge.
 * Key missable elements: In vertical mode, right_red_col requires a 2 *below* s in columns > left_red_col (not just in seed row); horizontal segments must be contiguous 2s of len>=2; vertical fills in horizontal mode are capped before the segment row (h = r-1); final vertical in horizontal mode goes to bottom from last previous_h+1; no filling above seed or left of col=0.
 * General considerations: Grid is rectangular (rows_n x cols_n); seed is unique (first 3 found); if no seed, return unchanged; propagation doesn't cross or overwrite non-8s; potential for incomplete chaining if segments don't overlap seed column projection.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Ensure mode detection doesn't false-positive (e.g., any 2 to right triggers vertical); handle long vertical 2-lines that span multiple rows; in horizontal, closer_dist logic might underfill if segments are asymmetric; BACKGROUND as 8 is confusing—it's both a cell value and a max extent proxy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional

def replace_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Helpful: Preprocess by aliasing 1s to 2s for uniform guide treatment."""
    return [[2 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]

def find_seed(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Helpful: Locates the unique starting 3 position (row, col). Returns None if absent."""
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 3:
                return i, j
    return None

def is_vertical_mode(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    """Helpful: Checks seed row for any 2 to the right of seed col, triggering vertical branch."""
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c + 1, len(grid[0])))
```

```python
# Note: vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are core but have bugs (see below); useful as skeletons.
# No custom types defined, but Tuple[int, int] for positions and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for segments (row, start_col, end_col) in horizontal mode are helpful for structuring.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid base logic for simpler cases (likely shorter grids or straightforward vertical/horizontal propagations without chaining or edge cases).
 * What worked: replace_ones and find_seed are reliable; mode detection works for training (e.g., correctly branches to vertical or horizontal); basic filling overwrites only 8s and preserves 2s/3s; vertical mode's left/right red col detection and num_8s span computation succeed in training.
 * What didn't work: In horizontal mode (likely used for test), segment detection misses or under-chains—e.g., it only filled a single vertical in col25 from row7 down and no horizontals, ignoring multiple 2-lines (verticals in col1 rows0-5, col7 rows6-13, col17 throughout?); closer_dist and edge_case logic may miscompute length_v or hor_start/end, leading to no horizontal fills; final vertical only partial (to row13, but grid has 14 rows?); current_c updating fails to propagate across segments, stopping early.
 * vertical_fill has issues: right_red_col search is overly restrictive (requires 2 below s, but may miss if no vertical below); connect_end computation uses right_red_col - left_v, which could be negative or wrong if num_8s skews; fills right horizontal from right_start (clamped) but may over/under-extend.
 * horizontal_fill is broken/incomplete: segments list only captures len>=2 horizontals below s, but test has vertical 2s (not horizontals?), so no segments found? j loop in segment detection assumes horizontal runs, but if 2s are vertical, it skips; is_first logic and previous_h tracking untested on multi-segment; hor_start/end uses BACKGROUND=8 directly (e.g., hor_end=8), but if cols_n >8, it underfills; edge_case overrides to full l but only if boundary hit.
 * No extract_objects function present or needed—puzzle is fill-propagation, not object extraction (don't pursue object-based approaches).
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of seed/mode but fails on complex test geometry (multiple disjoint vertical 2-lines, possibly needing horizontal interpretation as segments or mode misdetect).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x26 grid (inferred from list lengths) with unchanged 2s in approximate positions: vertical line of 2s in col1 rows0-5, another in col7 rows6-13, and col17 throughout all rows (based on repeated [...,2,...] patterns); only fills 3s in col25 (last column?) from row7 to row13 (7 cells), with no other 3s except the original seed (implied at bottom-right-ish).
 * This does not look correct: Expected full propagation would likely fill more 8s into 3s, e.g., horizontals connecting the 2-lines (like bridging col1 to col7 to col17), vertical drops from seed, or full spans in vertical mode; instead, it's minimal (only one short vertical fill), leaving most 8s untouched—suggests horizontal mode triggered but no segments detected (test 2s are vertical, not horizontal runs, so segments=[] and only final vertical from some default previous_h).
 * Observed effect: Partial fill only at bottom-right vertical (col25 rows7-13 as 3s), but seed seems lower (row6+ has 2 in col25? print ends with 3s there); differs from expected by not chaining across the three vertical 2-lines (e.g., no horizontal at row5 connecting col1 to col7, no extension to col17); unknown why col25 specifically (perhaps default BACKGROUND=8 misread as col); no horizontals at all, despite code attempting them.
 * Test likely needs better segment detection for vertical 2s (treat as horizontal proj? or mode error); output ignores upper 2s entirely, suggesting start_v computation wrong or is_first skips.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 23:59:54] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with markers (2's as guides or lines, 3 as a seed/start point, 8's as unknowns to fill, and 1's to be replaced by 2's), where the goal is to propagate and fill paths or connections (with 3's) from the seed based on detected modes (vertical, left-guided, or downward with horizontal segments), ensuring connections follow guide lines without overfilling or missing branches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The seed (3) must be found first, and 1's are always replaced by 2's to treat them as guides, but this replacement happens globally before propagation.
 * Modes are mutually exclusive: check for vertical mode (any 2's to the right of seed in seed row), then left guide (any 2's to the left), falling back to downward propagation if neither.
 * Propagation involves calculating distances (e.g., above/below lengths for gap_num, often 1 or 2 based on symmetry), attaching horizontal/vertical fills to guides, and handling chains of guides with alternating directions or connections.
 * Subtlety: In right/left propagation, the first guide may use special symmetric gap filling (e.g., if above_len == below_len, gap_num=1 else 2), but subsequent guides use row_dist for attachment, which can lead to clipped or max/min bounded fills to avoid out-of-bounds.
 * Downward mode looks for horizontal segments of at least 2 consecutive 2's below the seed row, then zigzags (alternating left/right targets) with vertical extensions to connect them, but always fills a single cell down from seed first.
 * Easy to miss: Guides must have 2's at or below seed row (has_guide check ignores upper 2's for below_start/end), and segments are only horizontal runs >=2 long starting from seed_row+1.
 * Bounds checking is critical (e.g., min/max with rows_n/cols_n) to prevent index errors, but over-aggressive filling can connect unrelated areas.
 * No backtracking or multiple seeds; assumes single seed and deterministic fill.
 * Unfilled 8's remain 8's; only replace if exactly on path (not adjacent or diagonal).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def replace_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[2 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing; ensures 1's act as guides without changing logic.)

```python
def find_seed(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    rows_n = len(grid)
    for i in range(rows_n):
        cols_n = len(grid[i])
        for j in range(cols_n):
            if grid[i][j] == 3:
                return i, j
    return -1, -1
```
(Essential for locating the starting point; simple but reliable.)

```python
def is_vertical_mode(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    cols_n = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c + 1, cols_n))

def has_left_guide(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c))
```
(Helpful for mode detection; vertical checks rightward in seed row, left checks leftward.)

```python
def find_right_guides(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    guides = []
    rows_n = len(grid)
    cols_n = len(grid[0])
    for j in range(c + 1, cols_n):
        start_r = rows_n
        b_start = rows_n
        b_end = -1
        has_guide = False
        for i in range(rows_n):
            if grid[i][j] == 2:
                start_r = min(start_r, i)
                if i >= s:
                    has_guide = True
                    b_start = min(b_start, i)
                    b_end = max(b_end, i)
        if has_guide:
            guides.append((j, start_r, b_start, b_end))
    return sorted(guides, key=lambda x: x[0])

def find_left_guides(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    # Similar to find_right_guides but scans leftward and sorts descending by column
    # (Omitted full code for brevity; useful for symmetric left propagation)
```
(These extract guide columns with their vertical extents, filtering for below-seed presence; key for chaining propagations.)

```python
def fill_line_vertical(grid: List[List[int]], col: int, start_row: int, end_row: int) -> None:
    rows_n = len(grid)
    for i in range(max(start_row, 0), min(end_row + 1, rows_n)):
        if grid[i][col] == 8:
            grid[i][col] = 3

def fill_line_horizontal(grid: List[List[int]], row: int, start_col: int, end_col: int) -> None:
    cols_n = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    for j in range(max(start_col, 0), min(end_col + 1, cols_n)):
        if grid[row][j] == 8:
            grid[row][j] = 3
```
(Basic but crucial for in-place filling; only overwrites 8's, preserving 2's and 3's.)

```python
def find_horizontal_segments(grid: List[List[int]], start_row: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    segments = []
    rows_n = len(grid)
    for r in range(start_row + 1, rows_n):
        row = grid[r]
        cols_n = len(row)
        i = 0
        while i < cols_n:
            if row[i] == 2:
                seg_start = i
                while i < cols_n and row[i] == 2:
                    i += 1
                seg_end = i - 1
                if seg_end - seg_start + 1 >= 2:
                    segments.append((r, seg_start, seg_end))
            else:
                i += 1
    return sorted(segments)
```
(Helpful for downward mode; identifies multi-cell horizontal 2-runs below seed row.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid mode detection and basic propagation logic works for simpler cases with clear vertical/left/down patterns.
 * Propagation functions (right/left/down) successfully chain guides and segments in training, using distance-based attachments and gap_num for symmetry, without index errors.
 * Mode fallback (vertical > left > down) prevented incorrect fills in training by prioritizing rightward checks first.
 * However, the seed is set to 3 immediately after finding, but propagation sometimes starts from adjacent cells, which worked in training but may skip direct seed connections.
 * find_right_guides and find_left_guides are helpful and correctly filter guides to those with below-seed 2's, avoiding upper-only guides; this was key to training success.
 * propagate_down alternates directions (left/right targets) for segments, which matched training zigzags, but uses fixed targets (1 for left, 2*c for right) that may not scale to asymmetric grids.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though propagate_left/right have complex idx==0 special cases that might overfill if has_at_s is misdetected.
 * In general, this attempt shows good understanding of path-connection rules but may miss subtle grid symmetries or multi-branch fills in more complex tests.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid (e.g., full horizontal 3's in row 6 from col 0-6 and 20-25, vertical 3's in col 20 from row 7-12, horizontal 3's in row 12 from col 8-20), suggesting downward or mixed-mode propagation from seed at (6,0), but leaves large areas of 8's (e.g., most of cols 2-19 in rows 0-5 and 7-11) unfilled, which does not make sense if the puzzle requires complete path connections along all guides.
 * Vertical 2's persist in cols 1 and 17 across rows 0-13, and a 2 at (6,7), but no 3's connect to the right-side guides (e.g., col 17's vertical line remains isolated except possibly at row 6's 2), indicating propagation_right or downward failed to bridge to right guides, unlike expected full connectivity.
 * Row 12's long horizontal 3-run (cols 8-20) connects a lower segment but ignores upper vertical guides (e.g., no vertical fills from row 6 down in col 8+), creating disconnected components; this differs from expected output where all 2-guides should link via 3-paths from seed.
 * Early rows (0-5) are entirely unchanged except persistent 2's, but if vertical mode was detected (due to right 2's in seed row?), it should have filled horizontals/verticals sooner— the lack of any 3's there suggests mode detection picked down but incompletely, missing initial vertical drop or segment connections.
 * Overall, the test output does not look correct: it under-fills (many isolated 2's and 8's), lacks symmetry in left/right propagation (e.g., heavy left fill in row 6 but sparse right), and stops abruptly (e.g., no fill below row 12), whereas expected output should connect all visible 2-structures into a single filled network from the seed without leaving gaps.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 00:00:01] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **all** train examples (inputs 1-4 and their outputs). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in every case, based on position, color, adjacency, bbox, or pixel count. I ignored test inputs as they are not part of the train set for consistency checking. No high-level solving or irrelevant/isolated elements (e.g., standalone Maroon background without transformation, non-adjacent pixels) are included. Unknowns (e.g., exact pixel counts or thickness rationale for Green/Maroon outputs) are noted as such rather than speculated.

#### 1. **Red-Blue Adjacency → Solid Red Bar Transformation**
   - **Description**: Sequences of Red and Blue pixels that are horizontally or vertically adjacent (forming straight-line clusters) are consistently merged into a single solid Red component in the output. This affects color (Blues become Red), bbox (expanded to cover the full cluster extent), and pixel count (total pixels = sum of input Red + Blue pixels in the cluster; no loss or gain).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Input: Adjacency (horizontal/vertical only; no diagonals observed), color (Red/Blue), bbox (line extent), pixels (individual 1-pixel units).
     - Output: Color (all Red), bbox (same as input cluster's bounding box), pixels (exact sum of input cluster's pixels), shape (solid bar/rectangle).
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: Horizontal cluster at y=7, x=6-12 (4 Blue + 3 Red = 7 pixels) → Red bar [6,7,12,7], 7 pixels.
     - Train 2: Vertical cluster at x=6, y=0-6 (1 Blue + 6 Red = 7 pixels) → Red [6,0,6,6], 7 pixels; vertical cluster at x=16, y=7-16 (5 Red + 5 Blue = 10 pixels) → Red [16,7,16,16], 10 pixels.
     - Train 3: Horizontal cluster at y=4, x=0-6 (1 Blue + 6 Red = 7 pixels) → Red [0,4,6,4], 7 pixels; horizontal at y=10, x=4-18 (12 Red + 3 Blue = 15 pixels) → Red [4,10,18,10], 15 pixels; horizontal at y=16, x=0-5 (2 Blue + 4 Red = 6 pixels) → Red [0,16,5,16], 6 pixels.
     - Train 4: Vertical cluster at x=5, y=0-5 (2 Blue + 4 Red = 6 pixels) → Red [5,0,5,5], 6 pixels; vertical at x=14, y=6-11 (5 Red + 1 Blue = 6 pixels) → Red [14,6,14,11], 6 pixels.
   - **Notes**: This is isolated from other colors/components (no overlap or effect from Green/Maroon). No non-adjacent or branched (non-linear) Red/Blue clusters in any example. Solid Red-only lines are preserved/merged similarly if adjacent to Blue.

#### 2. **Input Green Position (Edge Location) → Output Maroon Strip Orientation and Bbox**
   - **Description**: The input Green's edge position (bottom: y=0; left: x=0) determines the creation of an additional Maroon strip component in the output, affecting its orientation (vertical vs. horizontal), position (left edge vs. bottom edge), and bbox (fixed thickness along the axis perpendicular to orientation). The main Maroon background is consistently split/adjusted to produce this strip + a remaining Maroon component.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Input: Green position (specifically, y=0 for bottom or x=0 for left; no internal positions in train).
     - Output: New Maroon component (strip) color remains Maroon; bbox fixed thickness (x=0-7 for vertical, y=0-7 for horizontal; full extent in other dimension); pixels (unknown exact calculation—varies by background size/overlaps, e.g., 33/78 for vertical, 85/106 for horizontal); main Maroon bbox shifted (e.g., starts at x=2 for vertical cases).
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Bottom Green (y=0): Train 1 (x=8, y=0) and Train 3 (x=4, y=0) both → vertical left Maroon strip [0,0,7,18] + remaining Maroon starting at x=2 (to full width).
     - Left Green (x=0): Train 2 (x=0, y=3) and Train 4 (x=0, y=4) both → horizontal bottom Maroon strip [0,0,18,7] + remaining Maroon starting at y=4/5 (to full height).
   - **Notes**: Exact x/y coordinate beyond edge (e.g., x=4 vs. 8) has no consistent effect on strip bbox/thickness (always 0-7). Pixels for strip unknown (not matching simple area; possible overlaps with other components). No effect on Red/Blue transformations.

#### 3. **Input Green Position → Output Green Bbox and Pixels**
   - **Description**: The input Green's edge position (bottom y=0 vs. left x=0) determines the output Green's shape/orientation (vertical-ish vs. horizontal-ish), affecting bbox (aligned to full height/width, offset from 0/1, extent to ~8 units thick in short dimension) and pixels (low count suggesting non-filled L/border). Specific y/x beyond edge has inconsistent effect on extent (e.g., xmax fixed at 8 regardless of input x).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Input: Green position (y=0 for vertical output; x=0 for horizontal output).
     - Output: Green color remains Green; bbox (vertical: [1,0,8,full_height]; horizontal: [0,input_y,full_width,input_y+~4]; holes=0); pixels (unknown exact—e.g., 26/37 for vertical, 27/29 for horizontal; varies by background size).
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Bottom Green (y=0): Train 1 and 3 both → vertical Green [1,0,8,18] (full height, x-extent to 8).
     - Left Green (x=0): Train 2 (y=3) → horizontal Green [0,3,18,8]; Train 4 (y=4) → horizontal Green [0,4,18,8] (full width, y-extent ~4-5 units from input y).
   - **Notes**: Exact shape (e.g., L-border) unknown but bbox consistently suggests border-like alignment with Maroon strip (overlaps in x/y=1-7/0-7). Pixels unknown (not full bbox area; possible line thickness 1-2). Input x/y nuance (e.g., 4 vs. 8 → same xmax=8) is unknown transformation, not consistent effect. No interaction with Red/Blue.

#### Unknowns / Non-Consistent
- No consistent interactions involving holes (always 0, no effect).
- Maroon pixels in output strips/remaining: Unknown transformation (varies non-linearly with background size; possible subtraction of Green/Red overlaps).
- Green output pixels/thickness: Unknown exact rule (e.g., why +4/+5 in y for horizontal; why xmax=8 fixed for vertical despite input x variation).
- No connections for non-edge Green positions (not present in train).
- No cross-effects (e.g., Red/Blue clusters do not alter Green/Maroon; Maroon does not affect Red/Blue positions).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 00:02:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a path-propagation puzzle on a grid where a seed cell (3) initiates filling of empty cells (8) with paths (3) in horizontal and vertical lines, guided by existing path segments (2), following rules for direction (right/left/down) based on nearby guides, with connections that alternate or extend based on distances and segment lengths below or around the seed row/column.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 8 for empty/fillable cells, 2 for pre-existing guide paths (which may be partial lines or segments), 3 for the seed starting point and filled paths; 1s are replaced by 2s early, suggesting they are initial guides.
 * Propagation starts from the seed (3) location; detect "vertical mode" if any 2s exist to the right of seed in the seed row (prioritizes rightward horizontal fill with vertical drops); otherwise check for left guides (2s to left in seed row or below) to propagate leftward; fallback to downward propagation if no left/right guides.
 * In right/left propagation: Identify guide columns with 2s below the seed row; for each guide, compute the vertical span of 2s below (below_start to below_end, length = below_len); if guide has 2 at seed row, fill horizontal 3s toward it (gap of at least 2 cells? from code: fill_end = guide_j - 2), then drop vertical 3s down matching below_len; if no 2 at seed row, infer distance (row_dist = below_start - seed_row) and fill horizontal extending to/from guide based on that dist, then vertical drop of row_dist length; track previous ends to avoid overlap, and connect inner vertical drops with horizontal at max_end_r +1.
 * In downward propagation: Scan rows below seed for horizontal segments of 2s (length >=2); sort by row; connect vertically from seed col down to first segment's row, choosing left or right horizontal shift based on closer side (l_dist/r_dist to segment ends, targets at col=1 left or 2*seed_col right, capped by grid); then alternate horizontal fills (full left-to-right target) at segment rows +1, with vertical fills in between and to bottom; direction flips per segment (base_dir * (-1)^(segment_index)).
 * Subtle: Fills only overwrite 8s (not 2s or existing 3s); vertical fills in right/left modes start from seed_row+1; connections at max_end_r+1 only if inner_cols exist and within bounds; in down mode, first horizontal is partial to closer side, subsequent are full spans; segments must be contiguous 2s >=2 long; no propagation if no guides/segments.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap prevention via previous_end tracking; vertical end calculations (e.g., v_end_r = s + v_length, but min with rows_n-1); in down mode, start_v for first segment is after first_h, for others after previous_end_v; potential for asymmetric fills (e.g., not full grid width); seed might not be filled if already 3, but code ensures it.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 19x19? for ex3, 12x19? for ex4, 14x26 for test); assume rectangular, non-empty.
 * All considerations: Mode detection must be precise (any 2 right -> vertical mode, overriding left/down); below_len includes only from first 2 down, but max over all; fills are inclusive ranges; no diagonal or other directions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional

def replace_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[2 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]  # Helpful: Standardizes initial guides (1->2), used in all attempts.

def find_seed(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 3:
                return i, j
    return None  # Helpful: Locates unique seed (3); assumes one seed.

def is_vertical_mode(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c + 1, len(grid[0])))  # Helpful: Detects rightward priority for horizontal+vertical prop.

def has_left_guide(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c))  # Helpful but limited: Only checks seed row left; code extends to below in prop, but detection is row-only—potential bug if below-left only.

def fill_line_vertical(grid: List[List[int]], col: int, start_row: int, end_row: int):
    rows_n = len(grid)
    for i in range(max(start_row, 0), min(end_row + 1, rows_n)):
        if grid[i][col] == 8:
            grid[i][col] = 3  # Helpful: Core filler for verticals, bounds-checked, only 8s.

def fill_line_horizontal(grid: List[List[int]], row: int, start_col: int, end_col: int):
    cols_n = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    for j in range(max(start_col, 0), min(end_col + 1, cols_n)):
        if grid[row][j] == 8:
            grid[row][j] = 3  # Helpful: Core filler for horizontals, bounds-checked, only 8s.

# propagate_right_in_row, propagate_left_in_row, propagate_down: Core logic functions—helpful but buggy in details (see attempts); include guide col finding, below span calc, dist-based fills, alternating/connecting.
# program: Main orchestrator—helpful structure (replace, find, mode detect, conditional prop, return grid).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly detected modes and filled paths matching expected, suggesting basic seed finding, mode detection, and simple prop (e.g., single-guide or basic down segments) function well.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated overfills or misplaces 3s—e.g., row8 has 3s from col1-7 (unexpected, expected only col1? Wait, expected row8 [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,...] no, looking: generated row8 [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] matches expected row14? Mismatch in row indexing? Actually, generated row9/10 have 3 only at col1 but expected at col1; row11 has 2s starting col4 with full 2s to end but expected 3 at col1 and 2s from col4; row14 matches expected row8 but shifted; row15/16 expected 8s at col1 but generated 3s; row17 expected 2s to col5 +8s but generated 2s to col5 +8s +3 at col8? Overall, seems like left/right prop miscalculated inner_cols or connections, filling wrong vertical drops (e.g., extra 3s in lower left, missing some in row11 left).
 * Training 4 incorrect: Generated extra 3s in row5 cols0-3 (expected only 0-2, col3=8); row6 [8,8,8,3,8,2,...] but expected [8,8,3,8,8,2,...] (3 shifted left); row7/8 similar shifts/misses (generated 3 at col3 row7/8, expected col2); row9 generated [8,8,3,3,3,...] but expected [8,8,3,8,8,...] no full horizontal; suggests down prop or left prop wrong on segment distances/closer side choice, overextending horizontals or wrong vertical aligns.
 * propagate_right_in_row buggy: In ex3, likely overfills right horizontals and wrong v_end_r (e.g., connects at wrong row11 with full 2s? But 2s are guides, code fills 3s on 8s only); previous_right_end not preventing overlap properly; in no-has_at_s case, fill_start = guide_j - row_dist may extend too far left.
 * propagate_left_in_row buggy: In ex3/ex4, fills wrong inner_col (e.g., starting too right/left), leading to misplaced verticals (ex3 row15/16 extra 3s at col1); previous_left_end min/max logic flips directions incorrectly.
 * propagate_down buggy: In ex4, wrong closer_dist/is_left_closer (fills extra in row5 left, shifts 3s in row6/7); alternating this_dir = base_dir * (-1)**(h_num-1) may flip too soon, causing partial/full horizontal mismatches; seg_r +2 for end_v too rigid (ex4 row9 overfills horizontal at row8+1?).
 * has_left_guide limited to seed row—misses below-left guides, forcing wrong down mode in some cases (potential for ex3/ex4).
 * No extraction functions for segments/guides beyond inline—would help debugging, e.g., def extract_segments_below(row_start): to list (r, start, end) for validation.
 * Overall, mode detection and basic fills work, but distance calcs, overlap prevention, and alternating connections fail on multi-guide/segment cases; no handling for guides at/near edges.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows vertical 2s in col1 rows0-5 and col7 row5-13? Wait, input not given but output has consistent 2s in col1 rows0-5, col17 rows0-5, col7 rows5-13, col17 rows5-10?, seed at row6 col9=3, then horizontal 3s in row6 from col9-17 (but overwrites? No, fills 8s to 3s, but then extra 3s after col17 2 in row6 cols18-25); row7-10 have 3 at col9 only (under seed), but then row7 col19=3? And row11 col19=3 but others 8; no vertical fills down from seed col9 beyond row6, and left/right props seem partial/missing (e.g., no connection horizontals lower); looks like right prop triggered (vertical mode? Assuming right 2s), but only filled one horizontal in seed row to right guide, no vertical drops or further guides processed (missing multi-guide logic), and spurious 3s in right side row7+ (e.g., col19 row7=3, perhaps wrong fill_start); down mode not triggered but if it were, no segments filled; overall underfills verticals/connections and overfills isolated 3s, doesn't connect left/right guides properly—likely same bugs as ex3/4 in prop functions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to propagate fills (replacing background 8s with 3s) starting from a seed position marked by a 3, guided by lines or segments of 2s (which seem to represent paths, walls, or propagation guides) in either a vertical-dominant mode or a horizontal-dominant mode, while treating 1s as equivalent to 2s for propagation purposes. The rules involve detecting the mode based on the seed row's layout, then filling vertical and horizontal segments accordingly, potentially connecting or extending based on distances, lengths, and boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses numbers with specific meanings: 1s are treated as 2s (likely temporary or alias markers), 2s are propagation guides (e.g., lines that direct filling), 3 is the seed start and final fill target, 8 is background to be filled.
 * Mode detection is critical: vertical mode if there's a 2 to the right of the seed in the seed row; otherwise horizontal. This is a subtle binary choice that branches the entire logic.
 * In vertical mode, filling involves finding the nearest right 2-column with vertical extension below seed, computing lengths (e.g., num_8s as vertical span), then filling left/right horizontals from seed row, verticals at computed columns (left_v, right_v), and a connecting horizontal at the bottom (BACKGROUND=8, but capped to grid size).
 * In horizontal mode, it's more complex: scan rows below seed for horizontal segments of 2s (at least length 2), project vertical fills downward from seed or prior horizontals based on distance to segment edges (closer side, with edge cases for boundaries), cap heights to avoid overlapping segments, fill horizontals at computed heights (potentially full BACKGROUND width or adjusted), and update position (current_c) for chaining segments; ends with a final vertical drop.
 * Subtleties: BACKGROUND=8 is used both as a value and a conceptual full-width/length (e.g., hor_end=BACKGROUND means fill to grid edge); edge cases handle out-of-bounds (e.g., clamp to 0 or cols_n-1); vertical spans are computed as min distances but overridden in edge cases to full segment length; fills only overwrite 8s, preserving 2s and 3s; chaining in horizontal mode requires tracking previous_h and updating current_c toward the "far" edge.
 * Key missable elements: In vertical mode, right_red_col requires a 2 *below* s in columns > left_red_col (not just in seed row); horizontal segments must be contiguous 2s of len>=2; vertical fills in horizontal mode are capped before the segment row (h = r-1); final vertical in horizontal mode goes to bottom from last previous_h+1; no filling above seed or left of col=0.
 * General considerations: Grid is rectangular (rows_n x cols_n); seed is unique (first 3 found); if no seed, return unchanged; propagation doesn't cross or overwrite non-8s; potential for incomplete chaining if segments don't overlap seed column projection.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Ensure mode detection doesn't false-positive (e.g., any 2 to right triggers vertical); handle long vertical 2-lines that span multiple rows; in horizontal, closer_dist logic might underfill if segments are asymmetric; BACKGROUND as 8 is confusing—it's both a cell value and a max extent proxy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional

def replace_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Helpful: Preprocess by aliasing 1s to 2s for uniform guide treatment."""
    return [[2 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]

def find_seed(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Helpful: Locates the unique starting 3 position (row, col). Returns None if absent."""
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 3:
                return i, j
    return None

def is_vertical_mode(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    """Helpful: Checks seed row for any 2 to the right of seed col, triggering vertical branch."""
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c + 1, len(grid[0])))
```

```python
# Note: vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are core but have bugs (see below); useful as skeletons.
# No custom types defined, but Tuple[int, int] for positions and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for segments (row, start_col, end_col) in horizontal mode are helpful for structuring.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid base logic for simpler cases (likely shorter grids or straightforward vertical/horizontal propagations without chaining or edge cases).
 * What worked: replace_ones and find_seed are reliable; mode detection works for training (e.g., correctly branches to vertical or horizontal); basic filling overwrites only 8s and preserves 2s/3s; vertical mode's left/right red col detection and num_8s span computation succeed in training.
 * What didn't work: In horizontal mode (likely used for test), segment detection misses or under-chains—e.g., it only filled a single vertical in col25 from row7 down and no horizontals, ignoring multiple 2-lines (verticals in col1 rows0-5, col7 rows6-13, col17 throughout?); closer_dist and edge_case logic may miscompute length_v or hor_start/end, leading to no horizontal fills; final vertical only partial (to row13, but grid has 14 rows?); current_c updating fails to propagate across segments, stopping early.
 * vertical_fill has issues: right_red_col search is overly restrictive (requires 2 below s, but may miss if no vertical below); connect_end computation uses right_red_col - left_v, which could be negative or wrong if num_8s skews; fills right horizontal from right_start (clamped) but may over/under-extend.
 * horizontal_fill is broken/incomplete: segments list only captures len>=2 horizontals below s, but test has vertical 2s (not horizontals?), so no segments found? j loop in segment detection assumes horizontal runs, but if 2s are vertical, it skips; is_first logic and previous_h tracking untested on multi-segment; hor_start/end uses BACKGROUND=8 directly (e.g., hor_end=8), but if cols_n >8, it underfills; edge_case overrides to full l but only if boundary hit.
 * No extract_objects function present or needed—puzzle is fill-propagation, not object extraction (don't pursue object-based approaches).
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of seed/mode but fails on complex test geometry (multiple disjoint vertical 2-lines, possibly needing horizontal interpretation as segments or mode misdetect).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x26 grid (inferred from list lengths) with unchanged 2s in approximate positions: vertical line of 2s in col1 rows0-5, another in col7 rows6-13, and col17 throughout all rows (based on repeated [...,2,...] patterns); only fills 3s in col25 (last column?) from row7 to row13 (7 cells), with no other 3s except the original seed (implied at bottom-right-ish).
 * This does not look correct: Expected full propagation would likely fill more 8s into 3s, e.g., horizontals connecting the 2-lines (like bridging col1 to col7 to col17), vertical drops from seed, or full spans in vertical mode; instead, it's minimal (only one short vertical fill), leaving most 8s untouched—suggests horizontal mode triggered but no segments detected (test 2s are vertical, not horizontal runs, so segments=[] and only final vertical from some default previous_h).
 * Observed effect: Partial fill only at bottom-right vertical (col25 rows7-13 as 3s), but seed seems lower (row6+ has 2 in col25? print ends with 3s there); differs from expected by not chaining across the three vertical 2-lines (e.g., no horizontal at row5 connecting col1 to col7, no extension to col17); unknown why col25 specifically (perhaps default BACKGROUND=8 misread as col); no horizontals at all, despite code attempting them.
 * Test likely needs better segment detection for vertical 2s (treat as horizontal proj? or mode error); output ignores upper 2s entirely, suggesting start_v computation wrong or is_first skips.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with markers (2's as guides or lines, 3 as a seed/start point, 8's as unknowns to fill, and 1's to be replaced by 2's), where the goal is to propagate and fill paths or connections (with 3's) from the seed based on detected modes (vertical, left-guided, or downward with horizontal segments), ensuring connections follow guide lines without overfilling or missing branches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The seed (3) must be found first, and 1's are always replaced by 2's to treat them as guides, but this replacement happens globally before propagation.
 * Modes are mutually exclusive: check for vertical mode (any 2's to the right of seed in seed row), then left guide (any 2's to the left), falling back to downward propagation if neither.
 * Propagation involves calculating distances (e.g., above/below lengths for gap_num, often 1 or 2 based on symmetry), attaching horizontal/vertical fills to guides, and handling chains of guides with alternating directions or connections.
 * Subtlety: In right/left propagation, the first guide may use special symmetric gap filling (e.g., if above_len == below_len, gap_num=1 else 2), but subsequent guides use row_dist for attachment, which can lead to clipped or max/min bounded fills to avoid out-of-bounds.
 * Downward mode looks for horizontal segments of at least 2 consecutive 2's below the seed row, then zigzags (alternating left/right targets) with vertical extensions to connect them, but always fills a single cell down from seed first.
 * Easy to miss: Guides must have 2's at or below seed row (has_guide check ignores upper 2's for below_start/end), and segments are only horizontal runs >=2 long starting from seed_row+1.
 * Bounds checking is critical (e.g., min/max with rows_n/cols_n) to prevent index errors, but over-aggressive filling can connect unrelated areas.
 * No backtracking or multiple seeds; assumes single seed and deterministic fill.
 * Unfilled 8's remain 8's; only replace if exactly on path (not adjacent or diagonal).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def replace_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[2 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing; ensures 1's act as guides without changing logic.)

```python
def find_seed(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    rows_n = len(grid)
    for i in range(rows_n):
        cols_n = len(grid[i])
        for j in range(cols_n):
            if grid[i][j] == 3:
                return i, j
    return -1, -1
```
(Essential for locating the starting point; simple but reliable.)

```python
def is_vertical_mode(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    cols_n = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c + 1, cols_n))

def has_left_guide(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c))
```
(Helpful for mode detection; vertical checks rightward in seed row, left checks leftward.)

```python
def find_right_guides(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    guides = []
    rows_n = len(grid)
    cols_n = len(grid[0])
    for j in range(c + 1, cols_n):
        start_r = rows_n
        b_start = rows_n
        b_end = -1
        has_guide = False
        for i in range(rows_n):
            if grid[i][j] == 2:
                start_r = min(start_r, i)
                if i >= s:
                    has_guide = True
                    b_start = min(b_start, i)
                    b_end = max(b_end, i)
        if has_guide:
            guides.append((j, start_r, b_start, b_end))
    return sorted(guides, key=lambda x: x[0])

def find_left_guides(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    # Similar to find_right_guides but scans leftward and sorts descending by column
    # (Omitted full code for brevity; useful for symmetric left propagation)
```
(These extract guide columns with their vertical extents, filtering for below-seed presence; key for chaining propagations.)

```python
def fill_line_vertical(grid: List[List[int]], col: int, start_row: int, end_row: int) -> None:
    rows_n = len(grid)
    for i in range(max(start_row, 0), min(end_row + 1, rows_n)):
        if grid[i][col] == 8:
            grid[i][col] = 3

def fill_line_horizontal(grid: List[List[int]], row: int, start_col: int, end_col: int) -> None:
    cols_n = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    for j in range(max(start_col, 0), min(end_col + 1, cols_n)):
        if grid[row][j] == 8:
            grid[row][j] = 3
```
(Basic but crucial for in-place filling; only overwrites 8's, preserving 2's and 3's.)

```python
def find_horizontal_segments(grid: List[List[int]], start_row: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    segments = []
    rows_n = len(grid)
    for r in range(start_row + 1, rows_n):
        row = grid[r]
        cols_n = len(row)
        i = 0
        while i < cols_n:
            if row[i] == 2:
                seg_start = i
                while i < cols_n and row[i] == 2:
                    i += 1
                seg_end = i - 1
                if seg_end - seg_start + 1 >= 2:
                    segments.append((r, seg_start, seg_end))
            else:
                i += 1
    return sorted(segments)
```
(Helpful for downward mode; identifies multi-cell horizontal 2-runs below seed row.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid mode detection and basic propagation logic works for simpler cases with clear vertical/left/down patterns.
 * Propagation functions (right/left/down) successfully chain guides and segments in training, using distance-based attachments and gap_num for symmetry, without index errors.
 * Mode fallback (vertical > left > down) prevented incorrect fills in training by prioritizing rightward checks first.
 * However, the seed is set to 3 immediately after finding, but propagation sometimes starts from adjacent cells, which worked in training but may skip direct seed connections.
 * find_right_guides and find_left_guides are helpful and correctly filter guides to those with below-seed 2's, avoiding upper-only guides; this was key to training success.
 * propagate_down alternates directions (left/right targets) for segments, which matched training zigzags, but uses fixed targets (1 for left, 2*c for right) that may not scale to asymmetric grids.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though propagate_left/right have complex idx==0 special cases that might overfill if has_at_s is misdetected.
 * In general, this attempt shows good understanding of path-connection rules but may miss subtle grid symmetries or multi-branch fills in more complex tests.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid (e.g., full horizontal 3's in row 6 from col 0-6 and 20-25, vertical 3's in col 20 from row 7-12, horizontal 3's in row 12 from col 8-20), suggesting downward or mixed-mode propagation from seed at (6,0), but leaves large areas of 8's (e.g., most of cols 2-19 in rows 0-5 and 7-11) unfilled, which does not make sense if the puzzle requires complete path connections along all guides.
 * Vertical 2's persist in cols 1 and 17 across rows 0-13, and a 2 at (6,7), but no 3's connect to the right-side guides (e.g., col 17's vertical line remains isolated except possibly at row 6's 2), indicating propagation_right or downward failed to bridge to right guides, unlike expected full connectivity.
 * Row 12's long horizontal 3-run (cols 8-20) connects a lower segment but ignores upper vertical guides (e.g., no vertical fills from row 6 down in col 8+), creating disconnected components; this differs from expected output where all 2-guides should link via 3-paths from seed.
 * Early rows (0-5) are entirely unchanged except persistent 2's, but if vertical mode was detected (due to right 2's in seed row?), it should have filled horizontals/verticals sooner— the lack of any 3's there suggests mode detection picked down but incompletely, missing initial vertical drop or segment connections.
 * Overall, the test output does not look correct: it under-fills (many isolated 2's and 8's), lacks symmetry in left/right propagation (e.g., heavy left fill in row 6 but sparse right), and stops abruptly (e.g., no fill below row 12), whereas expected output should connect all visible 2-structures into a single filled network from the seed without leaving gaps.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **all** train examples (inputs 1-4 and their outputs). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in every case, based on position, color, adjacency, bbox, or pixel count. I ignored test inputs as they are not part of the train set for consistency checking. No high-level solving or irrelevant/isolated elements (e.g., standalone Maroon background without transformation, non-adjacent pixels) are included. Unknowns (e.g., exact pixel counts or thickness rationale for Green/Maroon outputs) are noted as such rather than speculated.

#### 1. **Red-Blue Adjacency → Solid Red Bar Transformation**
   - **Description**: Sequences of Red and Blue pixels that are horizontally or vertically adjacent (forming straight-line clusters) are consistently merged into a single solid Red component in the output. This affects color (Blues become Red), bbox (expanded to cover the full cluster extent), and pixel count (total pixels = sum of input Red + Blue pixels in the cluster; no loss or gain).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Input: Adjacency (horizontal/vertical only; no diagonals observed), color (Red/Blue), bbox (line extent), pixels (individual 1-pixel units).
     - Output: Color (all Red), bbox (same as input cluster's bounding box), pixels (exact sum of input cluster's pixels), shape (solid bar/rectangle).
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: Horizontal cluster at y=7, x=6-12 (4 Blue + 3 Red = 7 pixels) → Red bar [6,7,12,7], 7 pixels.
     - Train 2: Vertical cluster at x=6, y=0-6 (1 Blue + 6 Red = 7 pixels) → Red [6,0,6,6], 7 pixels; vertical cluster at x=16, y=7-16 (5 Red + 5 Blue = 10 pixels) → Red [16,7,16,16], 10 pixels.
     - Train 3: Horizontal cluster at y=4, x=0-6 (1 Blue + 6 Red = 7 pixels) → Red [0,4,6,4], 7 pixels; horizontal at y=10, x=4-18 (12 Red + 3 Blue = 15 pixels) → Red [4,10,18,10], 15 pixels; horizontal at y=16, x=0-5 (2 Blue + 4 Red = 6 pixels) → Red [0,16,5,16], 6 pixels.
     - Train 4: Vertical cluster at x=5, y=0-5 (2 Blue + 4 Red = 6 pixels) → Red [5,0,5,5], 6 pixels; vertical at x=14, y=6-11 (5 Red + 1 Blue = 6 pixels) → Red [14,6,14,11], 6 pixels.
   - **Notes**: This is isolated from other colors/components (no overlap or effect from Green/Maroon). No non-adjacent or branched (non-linear) Red/Blue clusters in any example. Solid Red-only lines are preserved/merged similarly if adjacent to Blue.

#### 2. **Input Green Position (Edge Location) → Output Maroon Strip Orientation and Bbox**
   - **Description**: The input Green's edge position (bottom: y=0; left: x=0) determines the creation of an additional Maroon strip component in the output, affecting its orientation (vertical vs. horizontal), position (left edge vs. bottom edge), and bbox (fixed thickness along the axis perpendicular to orientation). The main Maroon background is consistently split/adjusted to produce this strip + a remaining Maroon component.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Input: Green position (specifically, y=0 for bottom or x=0 for left; no internal positions in train).
     - Output: New Maroon component (strip) color remains Maroon; bbox fixed thickness (x=0-7 for vertical, y=0-7 for horizontal; full extent in other dimension); pixels (unknown exact calculation—varies by background size/overlaps, e.g., 33/78 for vertical, 85/106 for horizontal); main Maroon bbox shifted (e.g., starts at x=2 for vertical cases).
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Bottom Green (y=0): Train 1 (x=8, y=0) and Train 3 (x=4, y=0) both → vertical left Maroon strip [0,0,7,18] + remaining Maroon starting at x=2 (to full width).
     - Left Green (x=0): Train 2 (x=0, y=3) and Train 4 (x=0, y=4) both → horizontal bottom Maroon strip [0,0,18,7] + remaining Maroon starting at y=4/5 (to full height).
   - **Notes**: Exact x/y coordinate beyond edge (e.g., x=4 vs. 8) has no consistent effect on strip bbox/thickness (always 0-7). Pixels for strip unknown (not matching simple area; possible overlaps with other components). No effect on Red/Blue transformations.

#### 3. **Input Green Position → Output Green Bbox and Pixels**
   - **Description**: The input Green's edge position (bottom y=0 vs. left x=0) determines the output Green's shape/orientation (vertical-ish vs. horizontal-ish), affecting bbox (aligned to full height/width, offset from 0/1, extent to ~8 units thick in short dimension) and pixels (low count suggesting non-filled L/border). Specific y/x beyond edge has inconsistent effect on extent (e.g., xmax fixed at 8 regardless of input x).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Input: Green position (y=0 for vertical output; x=0 for horizontal output).
     - Output: Green color remains Green; bbox (vertical: [1,0,8,full_height]; horizontal: [0,input_y,full_width,input_y+~4]; holes=0); pixels (unknown exact—e.g., 26/37 for vertical, 27/29 for horizontal; varies by background size).
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Bottom Green (y=0): Train 1 and 3 both → vertical Green [1,0,8,18] (full height, x-extent to 8).
     - Left Green (x=0): Train 2 (y=3) → horizontal Green [0,3,18,8]; Train 4 (y=4) → horizontal Green [0,4,18,8] (full width, y-extent ~4-5 units from input y).
   - **Notes**: Exact shape (e.g., L-border) unknown but bbox consistently suggests border-like alignment with Maroon strip (overlaps in x/y=1-7/0-7). Pixels unknown (not full bbox area; possible line thickness 1-2). Input x/y nuance (e.g., 4 vs. 8 → same xmax=8) is unknown transformation, not consistent effect. No interaction with Red/Blue.

#### Unknowns / Non-Consistent
- No consistent interactions involving holes (always 0, no effect).
- Maroon pixels in output strips/remaining: Unknown transformation (varies non-linearly with background size; possible subtraction of Green/Red overlaps).
- Green output pixels/thickness: Unknown exact rule (e.g., why +4/+5 in y for horizontal; why xmax=8 fixed for vertical despite input x variation).
- No connections for non-edge Green positions (not present in train).
- No cross-effects (e.g., Red/Blue clusters do not alter Green/Maroon; Maroon does not affect Red/Blue positions).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:12:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a seed cell marked as 3 initiates propagation of fills (turning 8s into 3s) along lines guided by existing 2s (which represent structural guides or paths), with the direction and extent of propagation determined by the presence of vertical or horizontal guides relative to the seed. The goal is to simulate a filling or drawing process that follows specific rules for extending lines horizontally and vertically, often in a zigzag or segmented manner downward, while respecting distances and alignments from guide segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 8 for empty/fillable cells, 2 for fixed guide lines (horizontal or vertical), 1s are pre-replaced with 2s to treat them as guides, and 3 for the seed and propagated fills; propagation never overwrites 2s or existing 3s.
 * Determine mode at seed (s, c): vertical mode if any 2s to the right in the seed row from c+1 onward; left guide mode if any 2s to the left in the seed row from 0 to c-1; otherwise default to down mode.
 * In vertical/right mode, propagate horizontally right from seed row based on vertical guide lengths below, then drop vertical lines and connect at the end row; account for multiple guides and their offsets/starts.
 * In left mode, symmetric to right but propagating leftward, reversing sorts and calculations for distances.
 * In down mode (most complex), find horizontal 2-segments below the seed row (only segments of length >=2), then propagate in alternating directions (starting left or right based on first segment distances), using pre/post vertical drops and horizontal jogs at calculated rows, with lengths derived from segment distances (e.g., pre_length = (dist-2)//2, post_length = dist-2-pre_length); final vertical drop to bottom.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills only where 8s exist; vertical fills clip to grid bounds; for down mode first segment, special handling with pre_length=1, post_length=max(0,dist-3), and target column choice (1 for left, min(2*c, cols-1) for right) based on l_dist <= r_dist.
 * Easy to miss: Segments must be contiguous 2s >=2 long, sorted by row; row_dist calculations for offset guides (if no 2 at seed row, shift by b_start - s); connecting multiple drop_cols with horizontal at end_row if >1; no propagation if no guides/segments.
 * All propagations are in-place on the grid copy; seed is set to 3 immediately; if no seed, return unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid, seed at edges/bounds, no guides (full vertical drop in down mode), single vs. multiple segments, asymmetric distances leading to alternating left/right zigzags.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; previous iterations are not shown, but the current program correctly handles all 4 training examples, indicating solid mode detection and basic propagation logic.
 * What worked: Seed finding and replacement of 1s to 2s; vertical and left propagations (likely tested in training); down mode segment extraction and basic zigzag for simple cases; in-place filling without overwriting guides.
 * What didn't work: Down mode propagation for complex test cases with multiple segments and asymmetric distances—overly rigid target column choices (e.g., fixed to 1 or 2*c) and length calculations may not align properly with segment positions, leading to misaligned fills.
 * propagate_right and propagate_left are mostly correct but could miss offset calculations for guides not starting at seed row (row_dist logic is present but may undercount below_len if gaps exist).
 * propagate_down has issues in subsequent segments: alternating direction flips (is_left = not is_left) but target columns are hardcoded (1 or min(2*original_c, cols_n-1)), ignoring actual segment positions, causing jogs to wrong columns; first segment special casing works for training but fails when dist is small or segments are offset.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or keys mentioned in prior (unshown) attempts, but segment finding is essential for down mode.
 * Functions like replace_ones and find_seed are correct and helpful; no unhelpful functions noted yet, but the hardcoded targets in down mode are broken for varying grid widths/positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows vertical guides of 2s in column 1 (rows 0-5) and column 17 (rows 0-5, then continuing variably); seed at row 6, col 17 set to 3; horizontal fill of 3s in row 6 from col 18-25 (8 cells); scattered 3s in col 21 for rows 7-12; and a partial horizontal of 3s in row 13 from col 17-21.
 * This does not look fully correct: In down mode (inferred, as no right/left guides in seed row), it should propagate zigzags aligning to multiple horizontal segments below (visible 2s suggest segments around col 17+ in lower rows), but the fills are incomplete—e.g., no full vertical drops or horizontals connecting segments, and col 21 3s seem arbitrarily placed without matching segment distances (e.g., post_lengths not scaling to reach further segments); expected more symmetric or distance-based jogs to hit segment centers, and a final full vertical to bottom in the last target column.
 * Differences from expected: Too few 3s overall (only ~20-30 fills vs. potentially 50+ for full propagation); horizontal in row 13 is short and doesn't connect all drop points; no pre-verticals above first jog, suggesting first segment handling skipped dist-3 logic; the output mismatches a correct zigzag path that should weave left/right between segments at calculated row intervals, resulting in under-filling (it's okay to note the exact misalignment is unknown without input grid, but the sparsity indicates a bug).
 * The test output makes partial sense for a simple down propagation but fails on multi-segment complexity, missing connections and bound-respecting extends.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 00:12:13] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnections Across All Train Examples

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, the following interconnections between elements are obvious and consistent in **every** example (train 1–4). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other (e.g., via adjacency, position, or transformation) in all cases. I have excluded any high-level interpretations, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., standalone pixels with no adjacent interactions), or inconsistent patterns (e.g., variable Green orientations or exact pixel counts). Only direct, observable effects like merging, extension, or splitting are noted. Where a transformation occurs but the exact mechanism is not consistently explainable from position/color alone (e.g., why Green expands in one direction vs. another), it is called out as unknown.

#### 1. **Red and Blue Segments (Adjacency → Merging/Extension)**
   - **Interaction Description**: Blue pixels that are positionally adjacent (sharing the same row/column and immediate x/y coordinates, forming alternating or endpoint patterns) to Red bars consistently transform in the output such that the Blue pixels become Red, resulting in a solid, extended Red bar (no gaps or alternating colors remain). This affects the bounding box (bbox) and pixel count of the Red component by expanding it to encompass the former Blue positions.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (x/y coordinates): Blues at the start/end or interleaved within a Red bar's line (horizontal or vertical) trigger extension along that axis.
     - Color: Blue → Red transformation.
     - Shape Properties: Linear segments (e.g., 1-pixel thick bars) merge into continuous lines; holes remain 0, but bbox expands (e.g., min/max x or y shifts to include Blue).
     - Pixels: Total pixels in the resulting Red bar increase by the Blue's pixel count (always 1 in these cases).
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: Horizontal alternating Blue-Red at y=7 (x=6–12) → single solid horizontal Red bar [6,7,12,7] (bbox widened, pixels=7).
     - Train 2: Vertical Blue at top of Red bar (x=6, y=0 adjacent to y=1–6); alternating Red-Blue at x=16 (y=7–16) → extended vertical Red bars [6,0,6,6] and [16,7,16,16] (bbox height increased, pixels added).
     - Train 3: Horizontal Blue left of Red at y=4 (x=0 adjacent to x=1–6); trailing Blue-Red-Blue at y=10 (x=16–18 adjacent to x=4–15); interleaved Blue-Red at y=16 (x=0–5) → extended horizontal Red bars [0,4,6,4], [4,10,18,10], [0,16,5,16] (bbox width increased, pixels added).
     - Train 4: Vertical alternating Blue-Red-Blue at x=5 (y=0–2 adjacent to y=3–5); Blue below Red bar at x=14 (y=11 adjacent to y=6–10) → solid vertical Red bars [5,0,5,5] and [14,6,14,11] (bbox height increased, pixels added).
   - **Notes**: This interaction is always linear (horizontal or vertical) and only occurs when Blues are directly adjacent in the same row/column. No isolated Blues (not adjacent to Red) appear in trains, so no counterexamples. The exact length of extension beyond the Blue is unknown (consistent effect, but variable degree).

#### 2. **Green and Maroon Background (Position/Expansion → Splitting)**
   - **Interaction Description**: The single-pixel Green element (always holes=0, pixels=1) in the input expands in the output to a larger linear or partial-frame structure (increased bbox size and pixels), which positionally divides the Maroon background. This results in the Maroon splitting into exactly two separate components (reduced overall pixels, adjusted bboxes), with one Maroon on each "side" of the expanded Green (e.g., left/right or top/bottom). The Green's new position determines the split axis.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (x/y coordinates): Input Green position influences the output Green's bbox orientation (horizontal or vertical line/frame), which overlaps or borders the Maroon to create the split.
     - Color: Green remains Green; Maroon remains Maroon but is segmented.
     - Shape Properties: Green starts as a point (bbox degenerate, e.g., [x,y,x,y]) and expands to a line-like form (still holes=0, but wider/taller bbox); Maroon bboxes adjust to non-overlapping regions (e.g., narrowed width or cropped height).
     - Pixels: Green's pixels increase significantly (from 1 to 26–37); total Maroon pixels decrease (e.g., from ~200–300 to two parts totaling less), as areas are "claimed" by Green or other elements.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: Input Green [8,0,8,0] → output Green [1,0,8,18] (vertical expansion); Maroon splits into left [0,0,7,18] and right [2,0,12,18] (vertical divide, total pixels reduced from 239).
     - Train 2: Input Green [0,3,0,3] → output Green [0,3,18,8] (horizontal expansion); Maroon splits into top [0,0,18,7] and bottom [0,4,18,16] (horizontal divide, total pixels reduced from 305).
     - Train 3: Input Green [4,0,4,0] → output Green [1,0,8,18] (vertical expansion); Maroon splits into left [0,0,7,18] and right [2,0,18,18] (vertical divide, total pixels reduced from 332).
     - Train 4: Input Green [0,4,0,4] → output Green [0,4,18,8] (horizontal expansion); Maroon splits into top [0,0,18,7] and bottom [0,5,18,11] (horizontal divide, total pixels reduced from 215).
   - **Notes**: The expansion always creates a "border-like" Green that interacts with Maroon by partitioning the canvas space. The exact reason for vertical vs. horizontal orientation (e.g., based on input x vs. y dominance) is unknown—consistent effect, but variable axis. No other colors directly affect this split. Maroon does not interact with Red/Blue in a consistent way beyond background filling (no transformation of Maroon by Red/Blue observed).

#### Additional Observations on Scope
- **No Other Consistent Interactions**: 
  - Red/Blue do not consistently interact with Green or Maroon beyond incidental overlap (e.g., Red bars may cross Green lines, but no transformation effect is shared across all trains).
  - No hole properties interact (all elements have holes=0 consistently, no changes).
  - Silhouettes or edges do not show consistent effects on movement/transformation (e.g., no color-based "movement" like shifting positions observed).
  - Background Maroon's initial full-canvas fill ([0,0,width,height]) is consistently reduced but only via Green's split; no independent Maroon-Maroon interaction.
- **Unknowns**: The precise bbox dimensions of expanded Green (e.g., why [1,0,8,18] vs. full canvas width) cannot be explained from input position/color alone—consistent expansion occurs, but degree is variable and not forced here. No semantic meanings (e.g., "frame completion") are assumed, as they are not directly observable from properties.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 00:13:34] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a path-propagation puzzle on a grid where a seed cell (3) initiates filling of empty cells (8) with paths (3) in horizontal and vertical lines, guided by existing path segments (2), following rules for direction (right/left/down) based on nearby guides, with connections that alternate or extend based on distances and segment lengths below or around the seed row/column.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 8 for empty/fillable cells, 2 for pre-existing guide paths (which may be partial lines or segments), 3 for the seed starting point and filled paths; 1s are replaced by 2s early, suggesting they are initial guides.
 * Propagation starts from the seed (3) location; detect "vertical mode" if any 2s exist to the right of seed in the seed row (prioritizes rightward horizontal fill with vertical drops); otherwise check for left guides (2s to left in seed row or below) to propagate leftward; fallback to downward propagation if no left/right guides.
 * In right/left propagation: Identify guide columns with 2s below the seed row; for each guide, compute the vertical span of 2s below (below_start to below_end, length = below_len); if guide has 2 at seed row, fill horizontal 3s toward it (gap of at least 2 cells? from code: fill_end = guide_j - 2), then drop vertical 3s down matching below_len; if no 2 at seed row, infer distance (row_dist = below_start - seed_row) and fill horizontal extending to/from guide based on that dist, then vertical drop of row_dist length; track previous ends to avoid overlap, and connect inner vertical drops with horizontal at max_end_r +1.
 * In downward propagation: Scan rows below seed for horizontal segments of 2s (length >=2); sort by row; connect vertically from seed col down to first segment's row, choosing left or right horizontal shift based on closer side (l_dist/r_dist to segment ends, targets at col=1 left or 2*seed_col right, capped by grid); then alternate horizontal fills (full left-to-right target) at segment rows +1, with vertical fills in between and to bottom; direction flips per segment (base_dir * (-1)^(segment_index)).
 * Subtle: Fills only overwrite 8s (not 2s or existing 3s); vertical fills in right/left modes start from seed_row+1; connections at max_end_r+1 only if inner_cols exist and within bounds; in down mode, first horizontal is partial to closer side, subsequent are full spans; segments must be contiguous 2s >=2 long; no propagation if no guides/segments.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap prevention via previous_end tracking; vertical end calculations (e.g., v_end_r = s + v_length, but min with rows_n-1); in down mode, start_v for first segment is after first_h, for others after previous_end_v; potential for asymmetric fills (e.g., not full grid width); seed might not be filled if already 3, but code ensures it.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 19x19? for ex3, 12x19? for ex4, 14x26 for test); assume rectangular, non-empty.
 * All considerations: Mode detection must be precise (any 2 right -> vertical mode, overriding left/down); below_len includes only from first 2 down, but max over all; fills are inclusive ranges; no diagonal or other directions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    return [[2 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]  # Helpful: Standardizes initial guides (1->2), used in all attempts.

def find_seed(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 3:
                return i, j
    return None  # Helpful: Locates unique seed (3); assumes one seed.

def is_vertical_mode(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:

def has_left_guide(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c))  # Helpful but limited: Only checks seed row left; code extends to below in prop, but detection is row-only—potential bug if below-left only.

def fill_line_vertical(grid: List[List[int]], col: int, start_row: int, end_row: int):
    rows_n = len(grid)
    for i in range(max(start_row, 0), min(end_row + 1, rows_n)):
        if grid[i][col] == 8:
            grid[i][col] = 3  # Helpful: Core filler for verticals, bounds-checked, only 8s.

def fill_line_horizontal(grid: List[List[int]], row: int, start_col: int, end_col: int):
    cols_n = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    for j in range(max(start_col, 0), min(end_col + 1, cols_n)):
        if grid[row][j] == 8:
            grid[row][j] = 3  # Helpful: Core filler for horizontals, bounds-checked, only 8s.

# propagate_right_in_row, propagate_left_in_row, propagate_down: Core logic functions—helpful but buggy in details (see attempts); include guide col finding, below span calc, dist-based fills, alternating/connecting.
# program: Main orchestrator—helpful structure (replace, find, mode detect, conditional prop, return grid).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly detected modes and filled paths matching expected, suggesting basic seed finding, mode detection, and simple prop (e.g., single-guide or basic down segments) function well.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated overfills or misplaces 3s—e.g., row8 has 3s from col1-7 (unexpected, expected only col1? Wait, expected row8 [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,...] no, looking: generated row8 [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] matches expected row14? Mismatch in row indexing? Actually, generated row9/10 have 3 only at col1 but expected at col1; row11 has 2s starting col4 with full 2s to end but expected 3 at col1 and 2s from col4; row14 matches expected row8 but shifted; row15/16 expected 8s at col1 but generated 3s; row17 expected 2s to col5 +8s but generated 2s to col5 +8s +3 at col8? Overall, seems like left/right prop miscalculated inner_cols or connections, filling wrong vertical drops (e.g., extra 3s in lower left, missing some in row11 left).
 * Training 4 incorrect: Generated extra 3s in row5 cols0-3 (expected only 0-2, col3=8); row6 [8,8,8,3,8,2,...] but expected [8,8,3,8,8,2,...] (3 shifted left); row7/8 similar shifts/misses (generated 3 at col3 row7/8, expected col2); row9 generated [8,8,3,3,3,...] but expected [8,8,3,8,8,...] no full horizontal; suggests down prop or left prop wrong on segment distances/closer side choice, overextending horizontals or wrong vertical aligns.
 * propagate_right_in_row buggy: In ex3, likely overfills right horizontals and wrong v_end_r (e.g., connects at wrong row11 with full 2s? But 2s are guides, code fills 3s on 8s only); previous_right_end not preventing overlap properly; in no-has_at_s case, fill_start = guide_j - row_dist may extend too far left.
 * propagate_left_in_row buggy: In ex3/ex4, fills wrong inner_col (e.g., starting too right/left), leading to misplaced verticals (ex3 row15/16 extra 3s at col1); previous_left_end min/max logic flips directions incorrectly.
 * propagate_down buggy: In ex4, wrong closer_dist/is_left_closer (fills extra in row5 left, shifts 3s in row6/7); alternating this_dir = base_dir * (-1)**(h_num-1) may flip too soon, causing partial/full horizontal mismatches; seg_r +2 for end_v too rigid (ex4 row9 overfills horizontal at row8+1?).
 * has_left_guide limited to seed row—misses below-left guides, forcing wrong down mode in some cases (potential for ex3/ex4).
 * No extraction functions for segments/guides beyond inline—would help debugging, e.g., def extract_segments_below(row_start): to list (r, start, end) for validation.
 * Overall, mode detection and basic fills work, but distance calcs, overlap prevention, and alternating connections fail on multi-guide/segment cases; no handling for guides at/near edges.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows vertical 2s in col1 rows0-5 and col7 row5-13? Wait, input not given but output has consistent 2s in col1 rows0-5, col17 rows0-5, col7 rows5-13, col17 rows5-10?, seed at row6 col9=3, then horizontal 3s in row6 from col9-17 (but overwrites? No, fills 8s to 3s, but then extra 3s after col17 2 in row6 cols18-25); row7-10 have 3 at col9 only (under seed), but then row7 col19=3? And row11 col19=3 but others 8; no vertical fills down from seed col9 beyond row6, and left/right props seem partial/missing (e.g., no connection horizontals lower); looks like right prop triggered (vertical mode? Assuming right 2s), but only filled one horizontal in seed row to right guide, no vertical drops or further guides processed (missing multi-guide logic), and spurious 3s in right side row7+ (e.g., col19 row7=3, perhaps wrong fill_start); down mode not triggered but if it were, no segments filled; overall underfills verticals/connections and overfills isolated 3s, doesn't connect left/right guides properly—likely same bugs as ex3/4 in prop functions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to propagate fills (replacing background 8s with 3s) starting from a seed position marked by a 3, guided by lines or segments of 2s (which seem to represent paths, walls, or propagation guides) in either a vertical-dominant mode or a horizontal-dominant mode, while treating 1s as equivalent to 2s for propagation purposes. The rules involve detecting the mode based on the seed row's layout, then filling vertical and horizontal segments accordingly, potentially connecting or extending based on distances, lengths, and boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses numbers with specific meanings: 1s are treated as 2s (likely temporary or alias markers), 2s are propagation guides (e.g., lines that direct filling), 3 is the seed start and final fill target, 8 is background to be filled.
 * Mode detection is critical: vertical mode if there's a 2 to the right of the seed in the seed row; otherwise horizontal. This is a subtle binary choice that branches the entire logic.
 * In vertical mode, filling involves finding the nearest right 2-column with vertical extension below seed, computing lengths (e.g., num_8s as vertical span), then filling left/right horizontals from seed row, verticals at computed columns (left_v, right_v), and a connecting horizontal at the bottom (BACKGROUND=8, but capped to grid size).
 * In horizontal mode, it's more complex: scan rows below seed for horizontal segments of 2s (at least length 2), project vertical fills downward from seed or prior horizontals based on distance to segment edges (closer side, with edge cases for boundaries), cap heights to avoid overlapping segments, fill horizontals at computed heights (potentially full BACKGROUND width or adjusted), and update position (current_c) for chaining segments; ends with a final vertical drop.
 * Subtleties: BACKGROUND=8 is used both as a value and a conceptual full-width/length (e.g., hor_end=BACKGROUND means fill to grid edge); edge cases handle out-of-bounds (e.g., clamp to 0 or cols_n-1); vertical spans are computed as min distances but overridden in edge cases to full segment length; fills only overwrite 8s, preserving 2s and 3s; chaining in horizontal mode requires tracking previous_h and updating current_c toward the "far" edge.
 * Key missable elements: In vertical mode, right_red_col requires a 2 *below* s in columns > left_red_col (not just in seed row); horizontal segments must be contiguous 2s of len>=2; vertical fills in horizontal mode are capped before the segment row (h = r-1); final vertical in horizontal mode goes to bottom from last previous_h+1; no filling above seed or left of col=0.
 * General considerations: Grid is rectangular (rows_n x cols_n); seed is unique (first 3 found); if no seed, return unchanged; propagation doesn't cross or overwrite non-8s; potential for incomplete chaining if segments don't overlap seed column projection.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Ensure mode detection doesn't false-positive (e.g., any 2 to right triggers vertical); handle long vertical 2-lines that span multiple rows; in horizontal, closer_dist logic might underfill if segments are asymmetric; BACKGROUND as 8 is confusing—it's both a cell value and a max extent proxy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional

def replace_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Helpful: Preprocess by aliasing 1s to 2s for uniform guide treatment."""
    return [[2 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]

def find_seed(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Helpful: Locates the unique starting 3 position (row, col). Returns None if absent."""
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 3:
                return i, j
    return None

def is_vertical_mode(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    """Helpful: Checks seed row for any 2 to the right of seed col, triggering vertical branch."""
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c + 1, len(grid[0])))
```

```python
# Note: vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are core but have bugs (see below); useful as skeletons.
# No custom types defined, but Tuple[int, int] for positions and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for segments (row, start_col, end_col) in horizontal mode are helpful for structuring.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid base logic for simpler cases (likely shorter grids or straightforward vertical/horizontal propagations without chaining or edge cases).
 * What worked: replace_ones and find_seed are reliable; mode detection works for training (e.g., correctly branches to vertical or horizontal); basic filling overwrites only 8s and preserves 2s/3s; vertical mode's left/right red col detection and num_8s span computation succeed in training.
 * What didn't work: In horizontal mode (likely used for test), segment detection misses or under-chains—e.g., it only filled a single vertical in col25 from row7 down and no horizontals, ignoring multiple 2-lines (verticals in col1 rows0-5, col7 rows6-13, col17 throughout?); closer_dist and edge_case logic may miscompute length_v or hor_start/end, leading to no horizontal fills; final vertical only partial (to row13, but grid has 14 rows?); current_c updating fails to propagate across segments, stopping early.
 * vertical_fill has issues: right_red_col search is overly restrictive (requires 2 below s, but may miss if no vertical below); connect_end computation uses right_red_col - left_v, which could be negative or wrong if num_8s skews; fills right horizontal from right_start (clamped) but may over/under-extend.
 * horizontal_fill is broken/incomplete: segments list only captures len>=2 horizontals below s, but test has vertical 2s (not horizontals?), so no segments found? j loop in segment detection assumes horizontal runs, but if 2s are vertical, it skips; is_first logic and previous_h tracking untested on multi-segment; hor_start/end uses BACKGROUND=8 directly (e.g., hor_end=8), but if cols_n >8, it underfills; edge_case overrides to full l but only if boundary hit.
 * No extract_objects function present or needed—puzzle is fill-propagation, not object extraction (don't pursue object-based approaches).
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of seed/mode but fails on complex test geometry (multiple disjoint vertical 2-lines, possibly needing horizontal interpretation as segments or mode misdetect).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x26 grid (inferred from list lengths) with unchanged 2s in approximate positions: vertical line of 2s in col1 rows0-5, another in col7 rows6-13, and col17 throughout all rows (based on repeated [...,2,...] patterns); only fills 3s in col25 (last column?) from row7 to row13 (7 cells), with no other 3s except the original seed (implied at bottom-right-ish).
 * This does not look correct: Expected full propagation would likely fill more 8s into 3s, e.g., horizontals connecting the 2-lines (like bridging col1 to col7 to col17), vertical drops from seed, or full spans in vertical mode; instead, it's minimal (only one short vertical fill), leaving most 8s untouched—suggests horizontal mode triggered but no segments detected (test 2s are vertical, not horizontal runs, so segments=[] and only final vertical from some default previous_h).
 * Observed effect: Partial fill only at bottom-right vertical (col25 rows7-13 as 3s), but seed seems lower (row6+ has 2 in col25? print ends with 3s there); differs from expected by not chaining across the three vertical 2-lines (e.g., no horizontal at row5 connecting col1 to col7, no extension to col17); unknown why col25 specifically (perhaps default BACKGROUND=8 misread as col); no horizontals at all, despite code attempting them.
 * Test likely needs better segment detection for vertical 2s (treat as horizontal proj? or mode error); output ignores upper 2s entirely, suggesting start_v computation wrong or is_first skips.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with markers (2's as guides or lines, 3 as a seed/start point, 8's as unknowns to fill, and 1's to be replaced by 2's), where the goal is to propagate and fill paths or connections (with 3's) from the seed based on detected modes (vertical, left-guided, or downward with horizontal segments), ensuring connections follow guide lines without overfilling or missing branches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The seed (3) must be found first, and 1's are always replaced by 2's to treat them as guides, but this replacement happens globally before propagation.
 * Modes are mutually exclusive: check for vertical mode (any 2's to the right of seed in seed row), then left guide (any 2's to the left), falling back to downward propagation if neither.
 * Propagation involves calculating distances (e.g., above/below lengths for gap_num, often 1 or 2 based on symmetry), attaching horizontal/vertical fills to guides, and handling chains of guides with alternating directions or connections.
 * Subtlety: In right/left propagation, the first guide may use special symmetric gap filling (e.g., if above_len == below_len, gap_num=1 else 2), but subsequent guides use row_dist for attachment, which can lead to clipped or max/min bounded fills to avoid out-of-bounds.
 * Downward mode looks for horizontal segments of at least 2 consecutive 2's below the seed row, then zigzags (alternating left/right targets) with vertical extensions to connect them, but always fills a single cell down from seed first.
 * Easy to miss: Guides must have 2's at or below seed row (has_guide check ignores upper 2's for below_start/end), and segments are only horizontal runs >=2 long starting from seed_row+1.
 * Bounds checking is critical (e.g., min/max with rows_n/cols_n) to prevent index errors, but over-aggressive filling can connect unrelated areas.
 * No backtracking or multiple seeds; assumes single seed and deterministic fill.
 * Unfilled 8's remain 8's; only replace if exactly on path (not adjacent or diagonal).

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def replace_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[2 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(Helpful for preprocessing; ensures 1's act as guides without changing logic.)

```python

    for i in range(rows_n):
        cols_n = len(grid[i])
        for j in range(cols_n):
            if grid[i][j] == 3:
                return i, j
    return -1, -1
```
(Essential for locating the starting point; simple but reliable.)

```python
def is_vertical_mode(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    cols_n = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c + 1, cols_n))

def has_left_guide(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c))
```
(Helpful for mode detection; vertical checks rightward in seed row, left checks leftward.)

```python

    guides = []

            if grid[i][j] == 2:
                start_r = min(start_r, i)
                if i >= s:
                    has_guide = True
                    b_start = min(b_start, i)
                    b_end = max(b_end, i)
        if has_guide:
            guides.append((j, start_r, b_start, b_end))
    return sorted(guides, key=lambda x: x[0])

def find_left_guides(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    # Similar to find_right_guides but scans leftward and sorts descending by column
    # (Omitted full code for brevity; useful for symmetric left propagation)
```
(These extract guide columns with their vertical extents, filtering for below-seed presence; key for chaining propagations.)

```python
def fill_line_vertical(grid: List[List[int]], col: int, start_row: int, end_row: int) -> None:
    rows_n = len(grid)
    for i in range(max(start_row, 0), min(end_row + 1, rows_n)):
        if grid[i][col] == 8:
            grid[i][col] = 3

def fill_line_horizontal(grid: List[List[int]], row: int, start_col: int, end_col: int) -> None:
    cols_n = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0

        if grid[row][j] == 8:
            grid[row][j] = 3
```
(Basic but crucial for in-place filling; only overwrites 8's, preserving 2's and 3's.)

```python
def find_horizontal_segments(grid: List[List[int]], start_row: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    segments = []
    rows_n = len(grid)
    for r in range(start_row + 1, rows_n):

        cols_n = len(row)
        i = 0
        while i < cols_n:

                seg_start = i
                while i < cols_n and row[i] == 2:
                    i += 1
                seg_end = i - 1
                if seg_end - seg_start + 1 >= 2:
                    segments.append((r, seg_start, seg_end))
            else:
                i += 1
    return sorted(segments)
```
(Helpful for downward mode; identifies multi-cell horizontal 2-runs below seed row.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid mode detection and basic propagation logic works for simpler cases with clear vertical/left/down patterns.
 * Propagation functions (right/left/down) successfully chain guides and segments in training, using distance-based attachments and gap_num for symmetry, without index errors.
 * Mode fallback (vertical > left > down) prevented incorrect fills in training by prioritizing rightward checks first.
 * However, the seed is set to 3 immediately after finding, but propagation sometimes starts from adjacent cells, which worked in training but may skip direct seed connections.
 * find_right_guides and find_left_guides are helpful and correctly filter guides to those with below-seed 2's, avoiding upper-only guides; this was key to training success.
 * propagate_down alternates directions (left/right targets) for segments, which matched training zigzags, but uses fixed targets (1 for left, 2*c for right) that may not scale to asymmetric grids.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though propagate_left/right have complex idx==0 special cases that might overfill if has_at_s is misdetected.
 * In general, this attempt shows good understanding of path-connection rules but may miss subtle grid symmetries or multi-branch fills in more complex tests.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid (e.g., full horizontal 3's in row 6 from col 0-6 and 20-25, vertical 3's in col 20 from row 7-12, horizontal 3's in row 12 from col 8-20), suggesting downward or mixed-mode propagation from seed at (6,0), but leaves large areas of 8's (e.g., most of cols 2-19 in rows 0-5 and 7-11) unfilled, which does not make sense if the puzzle requires complete path connections along all guides.
 * Vertical 2's persist in cols 1 and 17 across rows 0-13, and a 2 at (6,7), but no 3's connect to the right-side guides (e.g., col 17's vertical line remains isolated except possibly at row 6's 2), indicating propagation_right or downward failed to bridge to right guides, unlike expected full connectivity.
 * Row 12's long horizontal 3-run (cols 8-20) connects a lower segment but ignores upper vertical guides (e.g., no vertical fills from row 6 down in col 8+), creating disconnected components; this differs from expected output where all 2-guides should link via 3-paths from seed.
 * Early rows (0-5) are entirely unchanged except persistent 2's, but if vertical mode was detected (due to right 2's in seed row?), it should have filled horizontals/verticals sooner— the lack of any 3's there suggests mode detection picked down but incompletely, missing initial vertical drop or segment connections.
 * Overall, the test output does not look correct: it under-fills (many isolated 2's and 8's), lacks symmetry in left/right propagation (e.g., heavy left fill in row 6 but sparse right), and stops abruptly (e.g., no fill below row 12), whereas expected output should connect all visible 2-structures into a single filled network from the seed without leaving gaps.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a seed cell marked as 3 initiates propagation of fills (turning 8s into 3s) along lines guided by existing 2s (which represent structural guides or paths), with the direction and extent of propagation determined by the presence of vertical or horizontal guides relative to the seed. The goal is to simulate a filling or drawing process that follows specific rules for extending lines horizontally and vertically, often in a zigzag or segmented manner downward, while respecting distances and alignments from guide segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 8 for empty/fillable cells, 2 for fixed guide lines (horizontal or vertical), 1s are pre-replaced with 2s to treat them as guides, and 3 for the seed and propagated fills; propagation never overwrites 2s or existing 3s.
 * Determine mode at seed (s, c): vertical mode if any 2s to the right in the seed row from c+1 onward; left guide mode if any 2s to the left in the seed row from 0 to c-1; otherwise default to down mode.
 * In vertical/right mode, propagate horizontally right from seed row based on vertical guide lengths below, then drop vertical lines and connect at the end row; account for multiple guides and their offsets/starts.
 * In left mode, symmetric to right but propagating leftward, reversing sorts and calculations for distances.
 * In down mode (most complex), find horizontal 2-segments below the seed row (only segments of length >=2), then propagate in alternating directions (starting left or right based on first segment distances), using pre/post vertical drops and horizontal jogs at calculated rows, with lengths derived from segment distances (e.g., pre_length = (dist-2)//2, post_length = dist-2-pre_length); final vertical drop to bottom.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills only where 8s exist; vertical fills clip to grid bounds; for down mode first segment, special handling with pre_length=1, post_length=max(0,dist-3), and target column choice (1 for left, min(2*c, cols-1) for right) based on l_dist <= r_dist.
 * Easy to miss: Segments must be contiguous 2s >=2 long, sorted by row; row_dist calculations for offset guides (if no 2 at seed row, shift by b_start - s); connecting multiple drop_cols with horizontal at end_row if >1; no propagation if no guides/segments.
 * All propagations are in-place on the grid copy; seed is set to 3 immediately; if no seed, return unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid, seed at edges/bounds, no guides (full vertical drop in down mode), single vs. multiple segments, asymmetric distances leading to alternating left/right zigzags.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; previous iterations are not shown, but the current program correctly handles all 4 training examples, indicating solid mode detection and basic propagation logic.
 * What worked: Seed finding and replacement of 1s to 2s; vertical and left propagations (likely tested in training); down mode segment extraction and basic zigzag for simple cases; in-place filling without overwriting guides.
 * What didn't work: Down mode propagation for complex test cases with multiple segments and asymmetric distances—overly rigid target column choices (e.g., fixed to 1 or 2*c) and length calculations may not align properly with segment positions, leading to misaligned fills.
 * propagate_right and propagate_left are mostly correct but could miss offset calculations for guides not starting at seed row (row_dist logic is present but may undercount below_len if gaps exist).
 * propagate_down has issues in subsequent segments: alternating direction flips (is_left = not is_left) but target columns are hardcoded (1 or min(2*original_c, cols_n-1)), ignoring actual segment positions, causing jogs to wrong columns; first segment special casing works for training but fails when dist is small or segments are offset.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or keys mentioned in prior (unshown) attempts, but segment finding is essential for down mode.
 * Functions like replace_ones and find_seed are correct and helpful; no unhelpful functions noted yet, but the hardcoded targets in down mode are broken for varying grid widths/positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows vertical guides of 2s in column 1 (rows 0-5) and column 17 (rows 0-5, then continuing variably); seed at row 6, col 17 set to 3; horizontal fill of 3s in row 6 from col 18-25 (8 cells); scattered 3s in col 21 for rows 7-12; and a partial horizontal of 3s in row 13 from col 17-21.
 * This does not look fully correct: In down mode (inferred, as no right/left guides in seed row), it should propagate zigzags aligning to multiple horizontal segments below (visible 2s suggest segments around col 17+ in lower rows), but the fills are incomplete—e.g., no full vertical drops or horizontals connecting segments, and col 21 3s seem arbitrarily placed without matching segment distances (e.g., post_lengths not scaling to reach further segments); expected more symmetric or distance-based jogs to hit segment centers, and a final full vertical to bottom in the last target column.
 * Differences from expected: Too few 3s overall (only ~20-30 fills vs. potentially 50+ for full propagation); horizontal in row 13 is short and doesn't connect all drop points; no pre-verticals above first jog, suggesting first segment handling skipped dist-3 logic; the output mismatches a correct zigzag path that should weave left/right between segments at calculated row intervals, resulting in under-filling (it's okay to note the exact misalignment is unknown without input grid, but the sparsity indicates a bug).
 * The test output makes partial sense for a simple down propagation but fails on multi-segment complexity, missing connections and bound-respecting extends.

### Consistent Interconnections Across All Train Examples

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, the following interconnections between elements are obvious and consistent in **every** example (train 1–4). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other (e.g., via adjacency, position, or transformation) in all cases. I have excluded any high-level interpretations, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., standalone pixels with no adjacent interactions), or inconsistent patterns (e.g., variable Green orientations or exact pixel counts). Only direct, observable effects like merging, extension, or splitting are noted. Where a transformation occurs but the exact mechanism is not consistently explainable from position/color alone (e.g., why Green expands in one direction vs. another), it is called out as unknown.

#### 1. **Red and Blue Segments (Adjacency → Merging/Extension)**
   - **Interaction Description**: Blue pixels that are positionally adjacent (sharing the same row/column and immediate x/y coordinates, forming alternating or endpoint patterns) to Red bars consistently transform in the output such that the Blue pixels become Red, resulting in a solid, extended Red bar (no gaps or alternating colors remain). This affects the bounding box (bbox) and pixel count of the Red component by expanding it to encompass the former Blue positions.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (x/y coordinates): Blues at the start/end or interleaved within a Red bar's line (horizontal or vertical) trigger extension along that axis.
     - Color: Blue → Red transformation.
     - Shape Properties: Linear segments (e.g., 1-pixel thick bars) merge into continuous lines; holes remain 0, but bbox expands (e.g., min/max x or y shifts to include Blue).
     - Pixels: Total pixels in the resulting Red bar increase by the Blue's pixel count (always 1 in these cases).
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: Horizontal alternating Blue-Red at y=7 (x=6–12) → single solid horizontal Red bar [6,7,12,7] (bbox widened, pixels=7).
     - Train 2: Vertical Blue at top of Red bar (x=6, y=0 adjacent to y=1–6); alternating Red-Blue at x=16 (y=7–16) → extended vertical Red bars [6,0,6,6] and [16,7,16,16] (bbox height increased, pixels added).
     - Train 3: Horizontal Blue left of Red at y=4 (x=0 adjacent to x=1–6); trailing Blue-Red-Blue at y=10 (x=16–18 adjacent to x=4–15); interleaved Blue-Red at y=16 (x=0–5) → extended horizontal Red bars [0,4,6,4], [4,10,18,10], [0,16,5,16] (bbox width increased, pixels added).
     - Train 4: Vertical alternating Blue-Red-Blue at x=5 (y=0–2 adjacent to y=3–5); Blue below Red bar at x=14 (y=11 adjacent to y=6–10) → solid vertical Red bars [5,0,5,5] and [14,6,14,11] (bbox height increased, pixels added).
   - **Notes**: This interaction is always linear (horizontal or vertical) and only occurs when Blues are directly adjacent in the same row/column. No isolated Blues (not adjacent to Red) appear in trains, so no counterexamples. The exact length of extension beyond the Blue is unknown (consistent effect, but variable degree).

#### 2. **Green and Maroon Background (Position/Expansion → Splitting)**
   - **Interaction Description**: The single-pixel Green element (always holes=0, pixels=1) in the input expands in the output to a larger linear or partial-frame structure (increased bbox size and pixels), which positionally divides the Maroon background. This results in the Maroon splitting into exactly two separate components (reduced overall pixels, adjusted bboxes), with one Maroon on each "side" of the expanded Green (e.g., left/right or top/bottom). The Green's new position determines the split axis.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (x/y coordinates): Input Green position influences the output Green's bbox orientation (horizontal or vertical line/frame), which overlaps or borders the Maroon to create the split.
     - Color: Green remains Green; Maroon remains Maroon but is segmented.
     - Shape Properties: Green starts as a point (bbox degenerate, e.g., [x,y,x,y]) and expands to a line-like form (still holes=0, but wider/taller bbox); Maroon bboxes adjust to non-overlapping regions (e.g., narrowed width or cropped height).
     - Pixels: Green's pixels increase significantly (from 1 to 26–37); total Maroon pixels decrease (e.g., from ~200–300 to two parts totaling less), as areas are "claimed" by Green or other elements.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: Input Green [8,0,8,0] → output Green [1,0,8,18] (vertical expansion); Maroon splits into left [0,0,7,18] and right [2,0,12,18] (vertical divide, total pixels reduced from 239).
     - Train 2: Input Green [0,3,0,3] → output Green [0,3,18,8] (horizontal expansion); Maroon splits into top [0,0,18,7] and bottom [0,4,18,16] (horizontal divide, total pixels reduced from 305).
     - Train 3: Input Green [4,0,4,0] → output Green [1,0,8,18] (vertical expansion); Maroon splits into left [0,0,7,18] and right [2,0,18,18] (vertical divide, total pixels reduced from 332).
     - Train 4: Input Green [0,4,0,4] → output Green [0,4,18,8] (horizontal expansion); Maroon splits into top [0,0,18,7] and bottom [0,5,18,11] (horizontal divide, total pixels reduced from 215).
   - **Notes**: The expansion always creates a "border-like" Green that interacts with Maroon by partitioning the canvas space. The exact reason for vertical vs. horizontal orientation (e.g., based on input x vs. y dominance) is unknown—consistent effect, but variable axis. No other colors directly affect this split. Maroon does not interact with Red/Blue in a consistent way beyond background filling (no transformation of Maroon by Red/Blue observed).

#### Additional Observations on Scope
- **No Other Consistent Interactions**: 
  - Red/Blue do not consistently interact with Green or Maroon beyond incidental overlap (e.g., Red bars may cross Green lines, but no transformation effect is shared across all trains).
  - No hole properties interact (all elements have holes=0 consistently, no changes).
  - Silhouettes or edges do not show consistent effects on movement/transformation (e.g., no color-based "movement" like shifting positions observed).
  - Background Maroon's initial full-canvas fill ([0,0,width,height]) is consistently reduced but only via Green's split; no independent Maroon-Maroon interaction.
- **Unknowns**: The precise bbox dimensions of expanded Green (e.g., why [1,0,8,18] vs. full canvas width) cannot be explained from input position/color alone—consistent expansion occurs, but degree is variable and not forced here. No semantic meanings (e.g., "frame completion") are assumed, as they are not directly observable from properties.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-01 00:23:16] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python

    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 3:
                return i, j
    return None

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:23:54] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where empty cells (8s) are filled with the seed value (3) by propagating horizontally and vertically from a starting seed position, guided by fixed guide cells (2s) that act as boundaries or hooks for the filling paths. The propagation follows specific modes (vertical, left, or down) based on the relative positions of guides to the seed, with rules for gaps, connections, and segment following to create structured paths or fills without crossing guides.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The seed (3) starts propagation, and 1s are pre-replaced with 2s (treating them as guides), but only 8s get filled to 3; 2s remain as boundaries.
 * Modes are determined hierarchically: vertical mode if any 2s exist to the right of the seed in the same row; otherwise, check for left guides in the same row; default to down propagation if neither.
 * In vertical mode, right propagation fills horizontally to the first right guide with a gap (1 or 2 cells based on below-guide length), then drops vertically and connects to further guides if multiple exist, potentially zigzagging or filling to the edge.
 * Left propagation mirrors right but fills leftward, with symmetric gap and connection logic.
 * Down propagation scans for horizontal segments of 2s below the seed row (segments of length >=2), then fills vertically down one row, followed by horizontal fills alternating left/right based on distances to segment ends, zigzagging down through segments with vertical fills in between.
 * Subtleties: Gaps are 2 if a guide has exactly 1 below it, else 1; connections use row distances to compute diagonal-like hooks; always clamp to grid bounds; no filling over 2s or existing 3s; if no guides/segments, fill entire remaining line (horizontal or vertical).
 * Easy to miss: Segments in down mode must be contiguous 2s >=2 long, sorted by row; alternating direction in zigzag must flip each time; single-guide cases drop vertically to the guide's below length; multiple guides may require connecting the closest two with vertical/horizontal lines from the drop point.
 * All fills are in-place on the grid; return the modified grid; handle empty/zero-size grids gracefully.
 * Propagation only starts if a seed (3) is found; otherwise, return unchanged (with 1s->2s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly passed all 4 training examples, indicating solid handling of basic propagation modes and filling for those cases.
 * Worked: replace_ones and find_seed reliably preprocess and locate the seed; fill_line_vertical/horizontal correctly skip 2s and bound to grid edges; mode detection (is_vertical_mode, has_left_guide) accurately chooses between right/left/down based on same-row guides.
 * Worked: Down propagation's segment finding and zigzag alternating (left/right based on distances) handled training cases without over/under-filling.
 * Didn't work fully: Right_propagate's multi-guide connection logic (using row_dist for connect_col and gap-based vertical fill) may misalign hooks in complex tests, leading to incomplete or incorrect connections; single-guide case fills to edge but may drop vertically too far/short.
 * Left_propagate mirrors right but had symmetric issues in training? (Passed, so likely fine, but watch for direction flips in connections).
 * find_right_guides and find_left_guides count below_len correctly (sum of 2s below starting row) and find b_start, but only collect guides with any 2s below/including start row; useful but could miss if no below 2s.
 * is_vertical_mode checks only same row to right, which is correct per mode priority but subtle—ignores below rows for mode choice.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though down_propagate's h_row advancement (to end_v +1) could skip rows if segments are sparse.
 * Overall, the program understands core rules but may need tweaks for gap calculations or multi-guide zigzags in non-training layouts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x26 grid (inferred from row lists) with seed at (6,0) as 3; rows 0-5 and 8-13 mostly have vertical 2s at cols 1 and 17, with 8s elsewhere; row 6 fills horizontally left-to-right with 3s from col 0-6, skips 2 at col 7, 8s to col 16, skips 2 at col 17, 3s from col 19-25.
 * Row 7 fills 3s from col 8-16 and col 19 (partial?); lower rows 8-13 have no fills beyond the vertical 2s.
 * This does not look fully correct: Expected full propagation from seed at left edge (likely right_propagate mode due to 2s to right in row 6 at cols 1? Wait, output has 3 at (6,0) but input seed position unclear—assuming standard). The partial horizontal in row 7 (3s only in middle and right snippet) suggests incomplete drop/connect from row 6's first guide (likely col 7's 2), missing vertical fill down col ~6-7 and connection to col 17's guide; zigzag or full edge fill to col 25 in row 6 seems cut off at col 19, ignoring potential multi-guide or gap=1/2 rule—fills stop prematurely before second guide without proper vertical drop/hook.
 * No fills below row 7 indicate down_propagate wasn't triggered (correct if right mode), but right_propagate seems to have failed multi-guide connection: expected vertical from drop_col (~6) down to align with col 17's below_len, then horizontal connect, but instead only spot-fills row 7 partially; this mismatches expected structured path (e.g., L-shape or continued horizontal to edge).
 * Upper rows 0-5 unchanged (all 8s except vertical 2s at 1/17) is correct—no upward propagation. Right side asymmetry (fills to 25 but gap at 18?) suggests bug in fill_end = j1 - gap -1 or connect_col calc; overall, output is ~60% filled but lacks complete paths, so incorrect for test.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 00:24:01] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **all** train examples (inputs 1-4 and their outputs). These are limited to elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case, based on color, position, shape properties (e.g., bbox, pixels), or transformations. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or assumptions about puzzle mechanics are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., static background spans without change) are excluded. Interactions that vary or are not present in every example are omitted. Unknowns (e.g., exact rules for expansion scale or orientation triggers) are noted explicitly where a connection exists but cannot be fully traced without forcing an explanation.

#### 1. **Blue ↔ Red (Color and Spatial Merge)**
   - **Interaction**: Blue pixels/segments consistently transform to Red color and merge spatially with adjacent Red segments/pixels in the output. This results in Blue disappearing entirely from outputs while Red extends to cover former Blue positions.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Color: Blue → Red (direct color change).
     - Position: Blue bbox coordinates are incorporated into expanded Red bbox (e.g., Blue at edge of Red segment causes Red bbox to extend by Blue's pixel width/height).
     - Pixels: Total pixels of merged Blue + adjacent Red = output Red pixels (e.g., Train 1: 4 Blue pixels + 4 Red pixels → 7 Red pixels, accounting for overlap/continuity; consistent in all examples).
     - Shape: Alternating Blue-Red segments (vertical or horizontal) in input → solid, continuous Red bar in output at same orientation and core position.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every train example; all Blues (4-5 instances per input) are absorbed into Reds (2-4 instances per input), with no residual Blues in any output.
   - **Unknown**: Exact merge priority (e.g., why Red bbox sometimes shifts 1 unit left/right, as in Train 3), but spatial absorption is consistent.

#### 2. **Green Position → Green Shape/Size in Output**
   - **Interaction**: The single-pixel Green in input affects its own transformation in output, expanding from a point to a larger shape that interacts with the overall canvas (e.g., influencing Maroon splits).
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position: Input Green bbox (always 1x1, single pixel) determines output Green bbox starting point and partial extent (e.g., input at bottom edge y=0 → output vertical bbox spanning full height y=0-18; input at left edge x=0 → output horizontal bbox spanning rightward x=0 to canvas width).
     - Pixels: Input Green always 1 pixel → output 26-37 pixels (consistent increase, indicating area growth).
     - Shape: Input point (bbox [x,x,y,y]) → output larger bbox with reduced pixel fill relative to bbox area (e.g., Train 1: bbox 8x19=152 area but 26 pixels → non-full fill, possibly outline/L-form per summary, but exact form unknown).
   - **Consistency**: Every input has exactly one Green (1 pixel); every output has exactly one expanded Green, with bbox anchored to input position. Expansion direction ties to input edge proximity (bottom/left in examples).
   - **Unknown**: Precise trigger for expansion orientation (e.g., why vertical for y=0 inputs, horizontal for x=0 inputs) or exact pixel count formula (varies 26-37 but always >>1); interaction exists but scale not fully traceable.

#### 3. **Red Position/Shape → Maroon Bbox Split**
   - **Interaction**: Extended Red bars in output (post-Blue merge) affect Maroon by constraining/splitting its regions, reducing Maroon's unified coverage.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position: Output Red bbox (horizontal/vertical bars) creates boundaries that divide input's single large Maroon into 2+ smaller Maroon instances (e.g., Red at y=7 splits Maroon above/below).
     - Shape: Red's continuous bar (no holes, post-merge) → Maroon bboxes adjusted to avoid Red's bbox (e.g., one Maroon ends at Red's y-start, another begins at Red's y-end).
     - Pixels: Total Maroon pixels decrease (e.g., Train 1: input 239 → output 33+181=214; consistent net loss across all, tied to Red extension covering former Maroon space).
   - **Consistency**: Every input has 1 large Maroon; every output has 2 Maroon regions (total pixels < input), directly adjacent to or bounded by Red bboxes. No example lacks this split.
   - **Unknown**: How Red's exact length influences Maroon pixel reduction (consistent loss but variable amount).

#### 4. **Green Expansion → Maroon Bbox Adjustment**
   - **Interaction**: Expanded Green in output affects Maroon by further constraining/splitting its regions, similar to Red but in perpendicular orientations.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position: Output Green bbox (e.g., vertical strip) overlaps or borders input Maroon, causing Maroon bboxes to shift (e.g., one Maroon starts 1 unit right of Green's x-end).
     - Shape: Green's larger bbox (post-expansion) → Maroon instances with reduced width/height to complement Green (e.g., Train 2: Green horizontal at y=3-8 → Maroon split at y=0-7 and y=4-16, overlapping y=4-7).
     - Pixels: Green's added pixels (26-37) correlate with Maroon's total reduction (consistent with Red's effect, combined net loss).
   - **Consistency**: In every output, expanded Green directly neighbors or bounds at least one Maroon bbox, contributing to the split (e.g., Green's x/y extents limit Maroon's min/max). No example where Green expansion doesn't adjust Maroon.
   - **Unknown**: Interaction strength vs. Red's (both affect Maroon splits consistently, but priority/overlap resolution not traceable).

#### General Consistent Properties Across All Interactions
- **Holes**: All shapes (Green, Blue, Red, Maroon) have holes=0 in inputs and outputs; no interaction introduces holes.
- **Canvas Interaction**: All transformations respect canvas edges (e.g., expansions stop at bbox max like 18), with positions near edges (e.g., Green at x=0 or y=0) triggering inward extensions consistently.
- **Absences as Interaction Markers**: Blue's complete absence in outputs is a direct effect of Red merge (consistent); no other colors (e.g., no new colors introduced).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no reliable hole count → color links, as all holes=0; no silhouette effects traceable; no color → position without above). Test inputs follow similar patterns (e.g., Blues/Reds alternating, single Green) but not analyzed for new connections per instructions.


============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 00:25:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a path-propagation puzzle on a grid where a seed cell (3) initiates filling of empty cells (8) with paths (3) in horizontal and vertical lines, guided by existing path segments (2), following rules for direction (right/left/down) based on nearby guides, with connections that alternate or extend based on distances and segment lengths below or around the seed row/column.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 8 for empty/fillable cells, 2 for pre-existing guide paths (which may be partial lines or segments), 3 for the seed starting point and filled paths; 1s are replaced by 2s early, suggesting they are initial guides.
 * Propagation starts from the seed (3) location; detect "vertical mode" if any 2s exist to the right of seed in the seed row (prioritizes rightward horizontal fill with vertical drops); otherwise check for left guides (2s to left in seed row or below) to propagate leftward; fallback to downward propagation if no left/right guides.
 * In right/left propagation: Identify guide columns with 2s below the seed row; for each guide, compute the vertical span of 2s below (below_start to below_end, length = below_len); if guide has 2 at seed row, fill horizontal 3s toward it (gap of at least 2 cells? from code: fill_end = guide_j - 2), then drop vertical 3s down matching below_len; if no 2 at seed row, infer distance (row_dist = below_start - seed_row) and fill horizontal extending to/from guide based on that dist, then vertical drop of row_dist length; track previous ends to avoid overlap, and connect inner vertical drops with horizontal at max_end_r +1.
 * In downward propagation: Scan rows below seed for horizontal segments of 2s (length >=2); sort by row; connect vertically from seed col down to first segment's row, choosing left or right horizontal shift based on closer side (l_dist/r_dist to segment ends, targets at col=1 left or 2*seed_col right, capped by grid); then alternate horizontal fills (full left-to-right target) at segment rows +1, with vertical fills in between and to bottom; direction flips per segment (base_dir * (-1)^(segment_index)).
 * Subtle: Fills only overwrite 8s (not 2s or existing 3s); vertical fills in right/left modes start from seed_row+1; connections at max_end_r+1 only if inner_cols exist and within bounds; in down mode, first horizontal is partial to closer side, subsequent are full spans; segments must be contiguous 2s >=2 long; no propagation if no guides/segments.
 * Easy to miss: Overlap prevention via previous_end tracking; vertical end calculations (e.g., v_end_r = s + v_length, but min with rows_n-1); in down mode, start_v for first segment is after first_h, for others after previous_end_v; potential for asymmetric fills (e.g., not full grid width); seed might not be filled if already 3, but code ensures it.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 19x19? for ex3, 12x19? for ex4, 14x26 for test); assume rectangular, non-empty.
 * All considerations: Mode detection must be precise (any 2 right -> vertical mode, overriding left/down); below_len includes only from first 2 down, but max over all; fills are inclusive ranges; no diagonal or other directions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def find_seed(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:

def has_left_guide(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c))  # Helpful but limited: Only checks seed row left; code extends to below in prop, but detection is row-only—potential bug if below-left only.

        if grid[i][col] == 8:
            grid[i][col] = 3  # Helpful: Core filler for verticals, bounds-checked, only 8s.

    cols_n = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    for j in range(max(start_col, 0), min(end_col + 1, cols_n)):
        if grid[row][j] == 8:
            grid[row][j] = 3  # Helpful: Core filler for horizontals, bounds-checked, only 8s.

# propagate_right_in_row, propagate_left_in_row, propagate_down: Core logic functions—helpful but buggy in details (see attempts); include guide col finding, below span calc, dist-based fills, alternating/connecting.
# program: Main orchestrator—helpful structure (replace, find, mode detect, conditional prop, return grid).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked for training 1 and 2: Correctly detected modes and filled paths matching expected, suggesting basic seed finding, mode detection, and simple prop (e.g., single-guide or basic down segments) function well.
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated overfills or misplaces 3s—e.g., row8 has 3s from col1-7 (unexpected, expected only col1? Wait, expected row8 [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,...] no, looking: generated row8 [8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] matches expected row14? Mismatch in row indexing? Actually, generated row9/10 have 3 only at col1 but expected at col1; row11 has 2s starting col4 with full 2s to end but expected 3 at col1 and 2s from col4; row14 matches expected row8 but shifted; row15/16 expected 8s at col1 but generated 3s; row17 expected 2s to col5 +8s but generated 2s to col5 +8s +3 at col8? Overall, seems like left/right prop miscalculated inner_cols or connections, filling wrong vertical drops (e.g., extra 3s in lower left, missing some in row11 left).
 * Training 4 incorrect: Generated extra 3s in row5 cols0-3 (expected only 0-2, col3=8); row6 [8,8,8,3,8,2,...] but expected [8,8,3,8,8,2,...] (3 shifted left); row7/8 similar shifts/misses (generated 3 at col3 row7/8, expected col2); row9 generated [8,8,3,3,3,...] but expected [8,8,3,8,8,...] no full horizontal; suggests down prop or left prop wrong on segment distances/closer side choice, overextending horizontals or wrong vertical aligns.
 * propagate_right_in_row buggy: In ex3, likely overfills right horizontals and wrong v_end_r (e.g., connects at wrong row11 with full 2s? But 2s are guides, code fills 3s on 8s only); previous_right_end not preventing overlap properly; in no-has_at_s case, fill_start = guide_j - row_dist may extend too far left.
 * propagate_left_in_row buggy: In ex3/ex4, fills wrong inner_col (e.g., starting too right/left), leading to misplaced verticals (ex3 row15/16 extra 3s at col1); previous_left_end min/max logic flips directions incorrectly.
 * propagate_down buggy: In ex4, wrong closer_dist/is_left_closer (fills extra in row5 left, shifts 3s in row6/7); alternating this_dir = base_dir * (-1)**(h_num-1) may flip too soon, causing partial/full horizontal mismatches; seg_r +2 for end_v too rigid (ex4 row9 overfills horizontal at row8+1?).
 * has_left_guide limited to seed row—misses below-left guides, forcing wrong down mode in some cases (potential for ex3/ex4).
 * No extraction functions for segments/guides beyond inline—would help debugging, e.g., def extract_segments_below(row_start): to list (r, start, end) for validation.
 * Overall, mode detection and basic fills work, but distance calcs, overlap prevention, and alternating connections fail on multi-guide/segment cases; no handling for guides at/near edges.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows vertical 2s in col1 rows0-5 and col7 row5-13? Wait, input not given but output has consistent 2s in col1 rows0-5, col17 rows0-5, col7 rows5-13, col17 rows5-10?, seed at row6 col9=3, then horizontal 3s in row6 from col9-17 (but overwrites? No, fills 8s to 3s, but then extra 3s after col17 2 in row6 cols18-25); row7-10 have 3 at col9 only (under seed), but then row7 col19=3? And row11 col19=3 but others 8; no vertical fills down from seed col9 beyond row6, and left/right props seem partial/missing (e.g., no connection horizontals lower); looks like right prop triggered (vertical mode? Assuming right 2s), but only filled one horizontal in seed row to right guide, no vertical drops or further guides processed (missing multi-guide logic), and spurious 3s in right side row7+ (e.g., col19 row7=3, perhaps wrong fill_start); down mode not triggered but if it were, no segments filled; overall underfills verticals/connections and overfills isolated 3s, doesn't connect left/right guides properly—likely same bugs as ex3/4 in prop functions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to propagate fills (replacing background 8s with 3s) starting from a seed position marked by a 3, guided by lines or segments of 2s (which seem to represent paths, walls, or propagation guides) in either a vertical-dominant mode or a horizontal-dominant mode, while treating 1s as equivalent to 2s for propagation purposes. The rules involve detecting the mode based on the seed row's layout, then filling vertical and horizontal segments accordingly, potentially connecting or extending based on distances, lengths, and boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses numbers with specific meanings: 1s are treated as 2s (likely temporary or alias markers), 2s are propagation guides (e.g., lines that direct filling), 3 is the seed start and final fill target, 8 is background to be filled.
 * Mode detection is critical: vertical mode if there's a 2 to the right of the seed in the seed row; otherwise horizontal. This is a subtle binary choice that branches the entire logic.
 * In vertical mode, filling involves finding the nearest right 2-column with vertical extension below seed, computing lengths (e.g., num_8s as vertical span), then filling left/right horizontals from seed row, verticals at computed columns (left_v, right_v), and a connecting horizontal at the bottom (BACKGROUND=8, but capped to grid size).
 * In horizontal mode, it's more complex: scan rows below seed for horizontal segments of 2s (at least length 2), project vertical fills downward from seed or prior horizontals based on distance to segment edges (closer side, with edge cases for boundaries), cap heights to avoid overlapping segments, fill horizontals at computed heights (potentially full BACKGROUND width or adjusted), and update position (current_c) for chaining segments; ends with a final vertical drop.
 * Subtleties: BACKGROUND=8 is used both as a value and a conceptual full-width/length (e.g., hor_end=BACKGROUND means fill to grid edge); edge cases handle out-of-bounds (e.g., clamp to 0 or cols_n-1); vertical spans are computed as min distances but overridden in edge cases to full segment length; fills only overwrite 8s, preserving 2s and 3s; chaining in horizontal mode requires tracking previous_h and updating current_c toward the "far" edge.
 * Key missable elements: In vertical mode, right_red_col requires a 2 *below* s in columns > left_red_col (not just in seed row); horizontal segments must be contiguous 2s of len>=2; vertical fills in horizontal mode are capped before the segment row (h = r-1); final vertical in horizontal mode goes to bottom from last previous_h+1; no filling above seed or left of col=0.
 * General considerations: Grid is rectangular (rows_n x cols_n); seed is unique (first 3 found); if no seed, return unchanged; propagation doesn't cross or overwrite non-8s; potential for incomplete chaining if segments don't overlap seed column projection.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Ensure mode detection doesn't false-positive (e.g., any 2 to right triggers vertical); handle long vertical 2-lines that span multiple rows; in horizontal, closer_dist logic might underfill if segments are asymmetric; BACKGROUND as 8 is confusing—it's both a cell value and a max extent proxy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional

def replace_ones(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Helpful: Preprocess by aliasing 1s to 2s for uniform guide treatment."""
    return [[2 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]

def find_seed(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Helpful: Locates the unique starting 3 position (row, col). Returns None if absent."""
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 3:
                return i, j
    return None

def is_vertical_mode(grid: List[List[int]], s: int, c: int) -> bool:
    """Helpful: Checks seed row for any 2 to the right of seed col, triggering vertical branch."""
    return any(grid[s][j] == 2 for j in range(c + 1, len(grid[0])))
```

```python
# Note: vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are core but have bugs (see below); useful as skeletons.
# No custom types defined, but Tuple[int, int] for positions and List[Tuple[int, int, int]] for segments (row, start_col, end_col) in horizontal mode are helpful for structuring.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid base logic for simpler cases (likely shorter grids or straightforward vertical/horizontal propagations without chaining or edge cases).
 * What worked: replace_ones and find_seed are reliable; mode detection works for training (e.g., correctly branches to vertical or horizontal); basic filling overwrites only 8s and preserves 2s/3s; vertical mode's left/right red col detection and num_8s span computation succeed in training.
 * What didn't work: In horizontal mode (likely used for test), segment detection misses or under-chains—e.g., it only filled a single vertical in col25 from row7 down and no horizontals, ignoring multiple 2-lines (verticals in col1 rows0-5, col7 rows6-13, col17 throughout?); closer_dist and edge_case logic may miscompute length_v or hor_start/end, leading to no horizontal fills; final vertical only partial (to row13, but grid has 14 rows?); current_c updating fails to propagate across segments, stopping early.
 * vertical_fill has issues: right_red_col search is overly restrictive (requires 2 below s, but may miss if no vertical below); connect_end computation uses right_red_col - left_v, which could be negative or wrong if num_8s skews; fills right horizontal from right_start (clamped) but may over/under-extend.
 * horizontal_fill is broken/incomplete: segments list only captures len>=2 horizontals below s, but test has vertical 2s (not horizontals?), so no segments found? j loop in segment detection assumes horizontal runs, but if 2s are vertical, it skips; is_first logic and previous_h tracking untested on multi-segment; hor_start/end uses BACKGROUND=8 directly (e.g., hor_end=8), but if cols_n >8, it underfills; edge_case overrides to full l but only if boundary hit.
 * No extract_objects function present or needed—puzzle is fill-propagation, not object extraction (don't pursue object-based approaches).
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of seed/mode but fails on complex test geometry (multiple disjoint vertical 2-lines, possibly needing horizontal interpretation as segments or mode misdetect).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x26 grid (inferred from list lengths) with unchanged 2s in approximate positions: vertical line of 2s in col1 rows0-5, another in col7 rows6-13, and col17 throughout all rows (based on repeated [...,2,...] patterns); only fills 3s in col25 (last column?) from row7 to row13 (7 cells), with no other 3s except the original seed (implied at bottom-right-ish).
 * This does not look correct: Expected full propagation would likely fill more 8s into 3s, e.g., horizontals connecting the 2-lines (like bridging col1 to col7 to col17), vertical drops from seed, or full spans in vertical mode; instead, it's minimal (only one short vertical fill), leaving most 8s untouched—suggests horizontal mode triggered but no segments detected (test 2s are vertical, not horizontal runs, so segments=[] and only final vertical from some default previous_h).
 * Observed effect: Partial fill only at bottom-right vertical (col25 rows7-13 as 3s), but seed seems lower (row6+ has 2 in col25? print ends with 3s there); differs from expected by not chaining across the three vertical 2-lines (e.g., no horizontal at row5 connecting col1 to col7, no extension to col17); unknown why col25 specifically (perhaps default BACKGROUND=8 misread as col); no horizontals at all, despite code attempting them.
 * Test likely needs better segment detection for vertical 2s (treat as horizontal proj? or mode error); output ignores upper 2s entirely, suggesting start_v computation wrong or is_first skips.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with markers (2's as guides or lines, 3 as a seed/start point, 8's as unknowns to fill, and 1's to be replaced by 2's), where the goal is to propagate and fill paths or connections (with 3's) from the seed based on detected modes (vertical, left-guided, or downward with horizontal segments), ensuring connections follow guide lines without overfilling or missing branches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The seed (3) must be found first, and 1's are always replaced by 2's to treat them as guides, but this replacement happens globally before propagation.
 * Modes are mutually exclusive: check for vertical mode (any 2's to the right of seed in seed row), then left guide (any 2's to the left), falling back to downward propagation if neither.
 * Propagation involves calculating distances (e.g., above/below lengths for gap_num, often 1 or 2 based on symmetry), attaching horizontal/vertical fills to guides, and handling chains of guides with alternating directions or connections.
 * Subtlety: In right/left propagation, the first guide may use special symmetric gap filling (e.g., if above_len == below_len, gap_num=1 else 2), but subsequent guides use row_dist for attachment, which can lead to clipped or max/min bounded fills to avoid out-of-bounds.
 * Downward mode looks for horizontal segments of at least 2 consecutive 2's below the seed row, then zigzags (alternating left/right targets) with vertical extensions to connect them, but always fills a single cell down from seed first.
 * Easy to miss: Guides must have 2's at or below seed row (has_guide check ignores upper 2's for below_start/end), and segments are only horizontal runs >=2 long starting from seed_row+1.
 * Bounds checking is critical (e.g., min/max with rows_n/cols_n) to prevent index errors, but over-aggressive filling can connect unrelated areas.
 * No backtracking or multiple seeds; assumes single seed and deterministic fill.
 * Unfilled 8's remain 8's; only replace if exactly on path (not adjacent or diagonal).

(Helpful for downward mode; identifies multi-cell horizontal 2-runs below seed row.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid mode detection and basic propagation logic works for simpler cases with clear vertical/left/down patterns.
 * Propagation functions (right/left/down) successfully chain guides and segments in training, using distance-based attachments and gap_num for symmetry, without index errors.
 * Mode fallback (vertical > left > down) prevented incorrect fills in training by prioritizing rightward checks first.
 * However, the seed is set to 3 immediately after finding, but propagation sometimes starts from adjacent cells, which worked in training but may skip direct seed connections.
 * find_right_guides and find_left_guides are helpful and correctly filter guides to those with below-seed 2's, avoiding upper-only guides; this was key to training success.
 * propagate_down alternates directions (left/right targets) for segments, which matched training zigzags, but uses fixed targets (1 for left, 2*c for right) that may not scale to asymmetric grids.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though propagate_left/right have complex idx==0 special cases that might overfill if has_at_s is misdetected.
 * In general, this attempt shows good understanding of path-connection rules but may miss subtle grid symmetries or multi-branch fills in more complex tests.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid (e.g., full horizontal 3's in row 6 from col 0-6 and 20-25, vertical 3's in col 20 from row 7-12, horizontal 3's in row 12 from col 8-20), suggesting downward or mixed-mode propagation from seed at (6,0), but leaves large areas of 8's (e.g., most of cols 2-19 in rows 0-5 and 7-11) unfilled, which does not make sense if the puzzle requires complete path connections along all guides.
 * Vertical 2's persist in cols 1 and 17 across rows 0-13, and a 2 at (6,7), but no 3's connect to the right-side guides (e.g., col 17's vertical line remains isolated except possibly at row 6's 2), indicating propagation_right or downward failed to bridge to right guides, unlike expected full connectivity.
 * Row 12's long horizontal 3-run (cols 8-20) connects a lower segment but ignores upper vertical guides (e.g., no vertical fills from row 6 down in col 8+), creating disconnected components; this differs from expected output where all 2-guides should link via 3-paths from seed.
 * Early rows (0-5) are entirely unchanged except persistent 2's, but if vertical mode was detected (due to right 2's in seed row?), it should have filled horizontals/verticals sooner— the lack of any 3's there suggests mode detection picked down but incompletely, missing initial vertical drop or segment connections.
 * Overall, the test output does not look correct: it under-fills (many isolated 2's and 8's), lacks symmetry in left/right propagation (e.g., heavy left fill in row 6 but sparse right), and stops abruptly (e.g., no fill below row 12), whereas expected output should connect all visible 2-structures into a single filled network from the seed without leaving gaps.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where a seed cell marked as 3 initiates propagation of fills (turning 8s into 3s) along lines guided by existing 2s (which represent structural guides or paths), with the direction and extent of propagation determined by the presence of vertical or horizontal guides relative to the seed. The goal is to simulate a filling or drawing process that follows specific rules for extending lines horizontally and vertically, often in a zigzag or segmented manner downward, while respecting distances and alignments from guide segments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 8 for empty/fillable cells, 2 for fixed guide lines (horizontal or vertical), 1s are pre-replaced with 2s to treat them as guides, and 3 for the seed and propagated fills; propagation never overwrites 2s or existing 3s.
 * Determine mode at seed (s, c): vertical mode if any 2s to the right in the seed row from c+1 onward; left guide mode if any 2s to the left in the seed row from 0 to c-1; otherwise default to down mode.
 * In vertical/right mode, propagate horizontally right from seed row based on vertical guide lengths below, then drop vertical lines and connect at the end row; account for multiple guides and their offsets/starts.
 * In left mode, symmetric to right but propagating leftward, reversing sorts and calculations for distances.
 * In down mode (most complex), find horizontal 2-segments below the seed row (only segments of length >=2), then propagate in alternating directions (starting left or right based on first segment distances), using pre/post vertical drops and horizontal jogs at calculated rows, with lengths derived from segment distances (e.g., pre_length = (dist-2)//2, post_length = dist-2-pre_length); final vertical drop to bottom.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills only where 8s exist; vertical fills clip to grid bounds; for down mode first segment, special handling with pre_length=1, post_length=max(0,dist-3), and target column choice (1 for left, min(2*c, cols-1) for right) based on l_dist <= r_dist.
 * Easy to miss: Segments must be contiguous 2s >=2 long, sorted by row; row_dist calculations for offset guides (if no 2 at seed row, shift by b_start - s); connecting multiple drop_cols with horizontal at end_row if >1; no propagation if no guides/segments.
 * All propagations are in-place on the grid copy; seed is set to 3 immediately; if no seed, return unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid, seed at edges/bounds, no guides (full vertical drop in down mode), single vs. multiple segments, asymmetric distances leading to alternating left/right zigzags.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; previous iterations are not shown, but the current program correctly handles all 4 training examples, indicating solid mode detection and basic propagation logic.
 * What worked: Seed finding and replacement of 1s to 2s; vertical and left propagations (likely tested in training); down mode segment extraction and basic zigzag for simple cases; in-place filling without overwriting guides.
 * What didn't work: Down mode propagation for complex test cases with multiple segments and asymmetric distances—overly rigid target column choices (e.g., fixed to 1 or 2*c) and length calculations may not align properly with segment positions, leading to misaligned fills.
 * propagate_right and propagate_left are mostly correct but could miss offset calculations for guides not starting at seed row (row_dist logic is present but may undercount below_len if gaps exist).
 * propagate_down has issues in subsequent segments: alternating direction flips (is_left = not is_left) but target columns are hardcoded (1 or min(2*original_c, cols_n-1)), ignoring actual segment positions, causing jogs to wrong columns; first segment special casing works for training but fails when dist is small or segments are offset.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or keys mentioned in prior (unshown) attempts, but segment finding is essential for down mode.
 * Functions like replace_ones and find_seed are correct and helpful; no unhelpful functions noted yet, but the hardcoded targets in down mode are broken for varying grid widths/positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows vertical guides of 2s in column 1 (rows 0-5) and column 17 (rows 0-5, then continuing variably); seed at row 6, col 17 set to 3; horizontal fill of 3s in row 6 from col 18-25 (8 cells); scattered 3s in col 21 for rows 7-12; and a partial horizontal of 3s in row 13 from col 17-21.
 * This does not look fully correct: In down mode (inferred, as no right/left guides in seed row), it should propagate zigzags aligning to multiple horizontal segments below (visible 2s suggest segments around col 17+ in lower rows), but the fills are incomplete—e.g., no full vertical drops or horizontals connecting segments, and col 21 3s seem arbitrarily placed without matching segment distances (e.g., post_lengths not scaling to reach further segments); expected more symmetric or distance-based jogs to hit segment centers, and a final full vertical to bottom in the last target column.
 * Differences from expected: Too few 3s overall (only ~20-30 fills vs. potentially 50+ for full propagation); horizontal in row 13 is short and doesn't connect all drop points; no pre-verticals above first jog, suggesting first segment handling skipped dist-3 logic; the output mismatches a correct zigzag path that should weave left/right between segments at calculated row intervals, resulting in under-filling (it's okay to note the exact misalignment is unknown without input grid, but the sparsity indicates a bug).
 * The test output makes partial sense for a simple down propagation but fails on multi-segment complexity, missing connections and bound-respecting extends.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where empty cells (8s) are filled with the seed value (3) by propagating horizontally and vertically from a starting seed position, guided by fixed guide cells (2s) that act as boundaries or hooks for the filling paths. The propagation follows specific modes (vertical, left, or down) based on the relative positions of guides to the seed, with rules for gaps, connections, and segment following to create structured paths or fills without crossing guides.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The seed (3) starts propagation, and 1s are pre-replaced with 2s (treating them as guides), but only 8s get filled to 3; 2s remain as boundaries.
 * Modes are determined hierarchically: vertical mode if any 2s exist to the right of the seed in the same row; otherwise, check for left guides in the same row; default to down propagation if neither.
 * In vertical mode, right propagation fills horizontally to the first right guide with a gap (1 or 2 cells based on below-guide length), then drops vertically and connects to further guides if multiple exist, potentially zigzagging or filling to the edge.
 * Left propagation mirrors right but fills leftward, with symmetric gap and connection logic.
 * Down propagation scans for horizontal segments of 2s below the seed row (segments of length >=2), then fills vertically down one row, followed by horizontal fills alternating left/right based on distances to segment ends, zigzagging down through segments with vertical fills in between.
 * Subtleties: Gaps are 2 if a guide has exactly 1 below it, else 1; connections use row distances to compute diagonal-like hooks; always clamp to grid bounds; no filling over 2s or existing 3s; if no guides/segments, fill entire remaining line (horizontal or vertical).
 * Easy to miss: Segments in down mode must be contiguous 2s >=2 long, sorted by row; alternating direction in zigzag must flip each time; single-guide cases drop vertically to the guide's below length; multiple guides may require connecting the closest two with vertical/horizontal lines from the drop point.
 * All fills are in-place on the grid; return the modified grid; handle empty/zero-size grids gracefully.
 * Propagation only starts if a seed (3) is found; otherwise, return unchanged (with 1s->2s).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly passed all 4 training examples, indicating solid handling of basic propagation modes and filling for those cases.
 * Worked: replace_ones and find_seed reliably preprocess and locate the seed; fill_line_vertical/horizontal correctly skip 2s and bound to grid edges; mode detection (is_vertical_mode, has_left_guide) accurately chooses between right/left/down based on same-row guides.
 * Worked: Down propagation's segment finding and zigzag alternating (left/right based on distances) handled training cases without over/under-filling.
 * Didn't work fully: Right_propagate's multi-guide connection logic (using row_dist for connect_col and gap-based vertical fill) may misalign hooks in complex tests, leading to incomplete or incorrect connections; single-guide case fills to edge but may drop vertically too far/short.
 * Left_propagate mirrors right but had symmetric issues in training? (Passed, so likely fine, but watch for direction flips in connections).
 * find_right_guides and find_left_guides count below_len correctly (sum of 2s below starting row) and find b_start, but only collect guides with any 2s below/including start row; useful but could miss if no below 2s.
 * is_vertical_mode checks only same row to right, which is correct per mode priority but subtle—ignores below rows for mode choice.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though down_propagate's h_row advancement (to end_v +1) could skip rows if segments are sparse.
 * Overall, the program understands core rules but may need tweaks for gap calculations or multi-guide zigzags in non-training layouts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x26 grid (inferred from row lists) with seed at (6,0) as 3; rows 0-5 and 8-13 mostly have vertical 2s at cols 1 and 17, with 8s elsewhere; row 6 fills horizontally left-to-right with 3s from col 0-6, skips 2 at col 7, 8s to col 16, skips 2 at col 17, 3s from col 19-25.
 * Row 7 fills 3s from col 8-16 and col 19 (partial?); lower rows 8-13 have no fills beyond the vertical 2s.
 * This does not look fully correct: Expected full propagation from seed at left edge (likely right_propagate mode due to 2s to right in row 6 at cols 1? Wait, output has 3 at (6,0) but input seed position unclear—assuming standard). The partial horizontal in row 7 (3s only in middle and right snippet) suggests incomplete drop/connect from row 6's first guide (likely col 7's 2), missing vertical fill down col ~6-7 and connection to col 17's guide; zigzag or full edge fill to col 25 in row 6 seems cut off at col 19, ignoring potential multi-guide or gap=1/2 rule—fills stop prematurely before second guide without proper vertical drop/hook.
 * No fills below row 7 indicate down_propagate wasn't triggered (correct if right mode), but right_propagate seems to have failed multi-guide connection: expected vertical from drop_col (~6) down to align with col 17's below_len, then horizontal connect, but instead only spot-fills row 7 partially; this mismatches expected structured path (e.g., L-shape or continued horizontal to edge).
 * Upper rows 0-5 unchanged (all 8s except vertical 2s at 1/17) is correct—no upward propagation. Right side asymmetry (fills to 25 but gap at 18?) suggests bug in fill_end = j1 - gap -1 or connect_col calc; overall, output is ~60% filled but lacks complete paths, so incorrect for test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **all** train examples (inputs 1-4 and their outputs). These are limited to elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case, based on color, position, shape properties (e.g., bbox, pixels), or transformations. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or assumptions about puzzle mechanics are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., static background spans without change) are excluded. Interactions that vary or are not present in every example are omitted. Unknowns (e.g., exact rules for expansion scale or orientation triggers) are noted explicitly where a connection exists but cannot be fully traced without forcing an explanation.

#### 1. **Blue ↔ Red (Color and Spatial Merge)**
   - **Interaction**: Blue pixels/segments consistently transform to Red color and merge spatially with adjacent Red segments/pixels in the output. This results in Blue disappearing entirely from outputs while Red extends to cover former Blue positions.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Color: Blue → Red (direct color change).
     - Position: Blue bbox coordinates are incorporated into expanded Red bbox (e.g., Blue at edge of Red segment causes Red bbox to extend by Blue's pixel width/height).
     - Pixels: Total pixels of merged Blue + adjacent Red = output Red pixels (e.g., Train 1: 4 Blue pixels + 4 Red pixels → 7 Red pixels, accounting for overlap/continuity; consistent in all examples).
     - Shape: Alternating Blue-Red segments (vertical or horizontal) in input → solid, continuous Red bar in output at same orientation and core position.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every train example; all Blues (4-5 instances per input) are absorbed into Reds (2-4 instances per input), with no residual Blues in any output.
   - **Unknown**: Exact merge priority (e.g., why Red bbox sometimes shifts 1 unit left/right, as in Train 3), but spatial absorption is consistent.

#### 2. **Green Position → Green Shape/Size in Output**
   - **Interaction**: The single-pixel Green in input affects its own transformation in output, expanding from a point to a larger shape that interacts with the overall canvas (e.g., influencing Maroon splits).
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position: Input Green bbox (always 1x1, single pixel) determines output Green bbox starting point and partial extent (e.g., input at bottom edge y=0 → output vertical bbox spanning full height y=0-18; input at left edge x=0 → output horizontal bbox spanning rightward x=0 to canvas width).
     - Pixels: Input Green always 1 pixel → output 26-37 pixels (consistent increase, indicating area growth).
     - Shape: Input point (bbox [x,x,y,y]) → output larger bbox with reduced pixel fill relative to bbox area (e.g., Train 1: bbox 8x19=152 area but 26 pixels → non-full fill, possibly outline/L-form per summary, but exact form unknown).
   - **Consistency**: Every input has exactly one Green (1 pixel); every output has exactly one expanded Green, with bbox anchored to input position. Expansion direction ties to input edge proximity (bottom/left in examples).
   - **Unknown**: Precise trigger for expansion orientation (e.g., why vertical for y=0 inputs, horizontal for x=0 inputs) or exact pixel count formula (varies 26-37 but always >>1); interaction exists but scale not fully traceable.

#### 3. **Red Position/Shape → Maroon Bbox Split**
   - **Interaction**: Extended Red bars in output (post-Blue merge) affect Maroon by constraining/splitting its regions, reducing Maroon's unified coverage.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position: Output Red bbox (horizontal/vertical bars) creates boundaries that divide input's single large Maroon into 2+ smaller Maroon instances (e.g., Red at y=7 splits Maroon above/below).
     - Shape: Red's continuous bar (no holes, post-merge) → Maroon bboxes adjusted to avoid Red's bbox (e.g., one Maroon ends at Red's y-start, another begins at Red's y-end).
     - Pixels: Total Maroon pixels decrease (e.g., Train 1: input 239 → output 33+181=214; consistent net loss across all, tied to Red extension covering former Maroon space).
   - **Consistency**: Every input has 1 large Maroon; every output has 2 Maroon regions (total pixels < input), directly adjacent to or bounded by Red bboxes. No example lacks this split.
   - **Unknown**: How Red's exact length influences Maroon pixel reduction (consistent loss but variable amount).

#### 4. **Green Expansion → Maroon Bbox Adjustment**
   - **Interaction**: Expanded Green in output affects Maroon by further constraining/splitting its regions, similar to Red but in perpendicular orientations.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position: Output Green bbox (e.g., vertical strip) overlaps or borders input Maroon, causing Maroon bboxes to shift (e.g., one Maroon starts 1 unit right of Green's x-end).
     - Shape: Green's larger bbox (post-expansion) → Maroon instances with reduced width/height to complement Green (e.g., Train 2: Green horizontal at y=3-8 → Maroon split at y=0-7 and y=4-16, overlapping y=4-7).
     - Pixels: Green's added pixels (26-37) correlate with Maroon's total reduction (consistent with Red's effect, combined net loss).
   - **Consistency**: In every output, expanded Green directly neighbors or bounds at least one Maroon bbox, contributing to the split (e.g., Green's x/y extents limit Maroon's min/max). No example where Green expansion doesn't adjust Maroon.
   - **Unknown**: Interaction strength vs. Red's (both affect Maroon splits consistently, but priority/overlap resolution not traceable).

#### General Consistent Properties Across All Interactions
- **Holes**: All shapes (Green, Blue, Red, Maroon) have holes=0 in inputs and outputs; no interaction introduces holes.
- **Canvas Interaction**: All transformations respect canvas edges (e.g., expansions stop at bbox max like 18), with positions near edges (e.g., Green at x=0 or y=0) triggering inward extensions consistently.
- **Absences as Interaction Markers**: Blue's complete absence in outputs is a direct effect of Red merge (consistent); no other colors (e.g., no new colors introduced).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no reliable hole count → color links, as all holes=0; no silhouette effects traceable; no color → position without above). Test inputs follow similar patterns (e.g., Blues/Reds alternating, single Green) but not analyzed for new connections per instructions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
