=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 15:29:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:35:22] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a bordered grid (framed by 5s) that contains a "key" or legend in the upper section defining color mappings (e.g., one color replacing another based on adjacent runs), with the lower section being the main image to transform by applying those mappings, detecting background colors, and preserving or adjusting internal patterns without over-filling solid blocks. The output should retain sparse, patterned structures (like alternating colors or gaps) in the transformed image, rather than solidifying runs into uniform blocks.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is always framed by 5s on all sides, with top/bottom borders as full rows of 5s; identify these to crop the working area, but ensure the output includes the full frame.
 * The "key" is in the top rows (above the main image), consisting of adjacent runs of colors (at least length 2) that imply mappings (e.g., color A next to color B maps A to B); only use the first valid pair per row, and stop at 5s, but avoid mapping across the entire row if patterns are interrupted.
 * Background detection should look inside the frame (excluding borders) for uniform rows or areas of a single non-5 color to set as bg, but only in the main image section (not key); default to 0 if none, but in examples, bg seems to be a filler like 8 or 1 that gets preserved or replaced selectively.
 * Transformations apply mappings to non-bg, non-5 cells, but crucially, do not fill entire runs solidly—preserve original sparse patterns (e.g., alternating colors like 2-8-2 or gaps with 1s); over-filling into blocks is a common error, as seen in outputs.
 * Subtle: Mappings are directional (e.g., left run maps to right run) and only for distinct colors; ignore short runs (<2) or same-color adjacencies; key may span multiple rows, but mappings should be consolidated without duplicates.
 * Main image may have repeated block-like structures (e.g., horizontal bars of colors), but expected outputs introduce gaps, singles, or alternations (e.g., inserting 1s or 8s to break solids), suggesting a rule for "decoding" or outlining shapes rather than direct replacement.
 * Edge cases: If no candidates for top/bottom, default to full grid; inner areas may not be uniform for bg; test inputs have asymmetric sections (e.g., 9s only on right), so mappings must handle partial coverage without assuming symmetry.
 * 5s are always preserved as borders or dividers; non-5 colors (1-9) represent objects or fills, but transformations can "reveal" hidden patterns by replacing or removing based on key.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes pattern preservation over simplification—expected outputs look like stylized letters or icons with gaps, while generated ones look like filled pixel art.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (full 5 rows) and left/right (5 frames), as outputs preserve the 5 borders accurately in both trainings.
 * Mappings extraction partially works (e.g., seems to map some colors like 2->something, but incorrectly applies them by filling runs solidly instead of preserving gaps/alternations).
 * Background detection fails or is misapplied: In training 1, bg=8 is used but over-fills 8 areas; in training 2, bg=1 is preserved but doesn't insert gaps correctly.
 * Build_output over-simplifies transformations: In training 1, generates solid [2,2,2] and [4,4,4] blocks where expected has [2,8,2] alternations and [4,8,4]; difference is unknown but likely due to not decoding patterns via key (e.g., key implies alternating with bg).
 * In training 2, generates full [4,4,4,4] where expected has broken [4,1,4] or [7,1,1,1]; this mismatches blob shapes for unknown reason (possibly key defines gap-insertion rules missed by extract_mappings).
 * find_left_right is buggy/not fully helpful: Relies only on top row's longest 5-run, which works for symmetric frames but may fail asymmetric test inputs.
 * extract_mappings is partially helpful but broken for multi-pair keys: Only grabs first pair per row and breaks early, leading to incomplete dicts (e.g., misses 4->7, 8->something in training 2).
 * Overall attempt shows basic frame detection but fails core transformation, resulting in INCORRECT for both trainings; no object extraction function present, which might be needed for pattern preservation (e.g., connected components to detect shapes before mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It generates large solid blocks (e.g., full rows of 4s, 9s on right, 2s/6s in middle, 8s/2s at bottom) within the 5 frame, but expected likely has sparse patterns with gaps or alternations (similar to trainings, e.g., breaking 9s with 4s or inserting bg like 4 between 2s/6s), as solid fills ignore key-based decoding.
 * Specifically, upper section has unbroken [9,9,9,9,9] where expected might alternate 9 with bg=4; middle has solid [2,2,2,2,2] and [6,6,6,6,6] likely needing gaps like [2,4,2]; bottom [8,8,8,8,8] to [2,2,2,2,2] should pattern like [8,2,8] or similar.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it repeats the over-filling error from trainings—test input's asymmetry (9s only right, 2s/6s/8s in sections) suggests mappings like 9->something sparse, but output treats as solid objects without transformation subtlety.
 * To handle test, account for vertical/horizontal partial keys and pattern-breaking rules (e.g., replace based on adjacency, not whole runs).

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (full 5 rows) and left/right (5 frames), as outputs preserve the 5 borders accurately in both trainings.
 * Mappings extraction partially works (e.g., seems to map some colors like 2->something, but incorrectly applies them by filling runs solidly instead of preserving gaps/alternations).
 * Background detection fails or is misapplied: In training 1, bg=8 is used but over-fills 8 areas; in training 2, bg=1 is preserved but doesn't insert gaps correctly.
 * Build_output over-simplifies transformations: In training 1, generates solid [2,2,2] and [4,4,4] blocks where expected has [2,8,2] alternations and [4,8,4]; difference is unknown but likely due to not decoding patterns via key (e.g., key implies alternating with bg).
 * In training 2, generates full [4,4,4,4] where expected has broken [4,1,4] or [7,1,1,1]; this mismatches blob shapes for unknown reason (possibly key defines gap-insertion rules missed by extract_mappings).
 * find_left_right is buggy/not fully helpful: Relies only on top row's longest 5-run, which works for symmetric frames but may fail asymmetric test inputs.
 * extract_mappings is partially helpful but broken for multi-pair keys: Only grabs first pair per row and breaks early, leading to incomplete dicts (e.g., misses 4->7, 8->something in training 2).
 * Overall attempt shows basic frame detection but fails core transformation, resulting in INCORRECT for both trainings; no object extraction function present, which might be needed for pattern preservation (e.g., connected components to detect shapes before mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It generates large solid blocks (e.g., full rows of 4s, 9s on right, 2s/6s in middle, 8s/2s at bottom) within the 5 frame, but expected likely has sparse patterns with gaps or alternations (similar to trainings, e.g., breaking 9s with 4s or inserting bg like 4 between 2s/6s), as solid fills ignore key-based decoding.
 * Specifically, upper section has unbroken [9,9,9,9,9] where expected might alternate 9 with bg=4; middle has solid [2,2,2,2,2] and [6,6,6,6,6] likely needing gaps like [2,4,2]; bottom [8,8,8,8,8] to [2,2,2,2,2] should pattern like [8,2,8] or similar.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it repeats the over-filling error from trainings—test input's asymmetry (9s only right, 2s/6s/8s in sections) suggests mappings like 9->something sparse, but output treats as solid objects without transformation subtlety.
 * To handle test, account for vertical/horizontal partial keys and pattern-breaking rules (e.g., replace based on adjacency, not whole runs).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:45:36] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the input grid contains borders and patterns marked by the number 5 (likely representing empty or framing space), with inner regions consisting of colored blocks (integers like 2,4,8 representing colors or objects). The goal is to extract and transform the inner content into a framed output grid, where borders are solidified with 5's, background is identified and filled appropriately, and patterned or scattered inner colors are consolidated into solid blocks of mapped or equivalent colors, preserving the overall shape and structure of the design while simplifying noisy or alternating patterns into clean, grouped regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 5 as a special border/empty marker; top and bottom borders are rows with a majority of 5's, and left/right borders are defined by overlapping runs of 5's in those border rows—subtlety: if no majority-5 rows exist, default to first and last rows, but this may not always apply if borders are partial.
 * Inner content (between borders, excluding side 5's) needs to be processed row-by-row: copy solid runs of 5 or background directly, but transform runs of other colors into solid blocks rather than alternating patterns; easy to miss that "mappings" should replace entire runs with a single target color (not alternate with background), based on adjacent color pairs in pre-border areas.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the strict inner area (rows top+1 to bottom-1, columns left+1 to right-1); subtlety: if no inner area exists, default to 0, but ensure it doesn't override borders or mapped blocks.
 * Mappings are derived from the top section (rows 0 to top inclusive): look for consecutive runs of >=2 identical non-5 colors before hitting a 5, and map the first color to the second if they differ; key subtlety: mappings are directional (color A adjacent to B maps A->B), skip single-cell runs, and stop at 5's— this may create incomplete dicts if patterns don't align perfectly, and unmapped colors should default to themselves.
 * Output framing: always create a subgrid sized to (bottom-top+1) x (right-left+1), with full 5 rows at top/bottom, full 5 columns on sides for inner rows, and fill inners by processing input rows top+1 to bottom-1, slicing columns left+1 to right, then applying background or mappings to runs without alternation.
 * Subtle elements: patterns in input may have noise like single interspersed cells or partial blocks that need consolidation (e.g., scattered 2's become solid 2-block); preserve row-specific variations without assuming uniform height for objects; handle cases where inner rows have varying run lengths or interruptions by background.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): ensure left/right overlap correctly from top/bottom 5-runs to avoid over-narrowing the frame; don't fill with alternating mapped/background as this creates striped noise instead of solid shapes; consider that expected outputs show vertical alignment of blocks across rows, suggesting object extraction or shape preservation beyond simple row-wise run processing.
 * General considerations: grids may have asymmetric patterns (e.g., train 2 has irregular block sizes), so avoid assuming symmetry; 5's inside inners should be treated as empty/background separators, not borders; test for edge cases like no mappings (fallback to original colors) or dominant background overwhelming counts.

(Note: The build_output function from the attempt is unhelpful/broken as-is, since it alternates mapped colors with background instead of filling solid blocks—do not reuse without fixing the inner fill loop to set entire run to mappings.get(val, val) without %2 alternation. No types like classes were used, but Tuple/Dict from typing are helpful for return types.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0 and 14 in train1/test, matching expected full-5 rows) and left/right via 5-run overlaps, producing framed outputs with correct dimensions and side 5-columns.
 * What worked: Border framing is solid (full 5's on top/bottom/sides), background detection seems accurate (e.g., 8 as bg in train1, 1 in train2, 4 in test), and mappings extraction partially works (identifies some color pairs like potentially 2->4 or similar, but application fails).
 * What didn't work: Inner filling alternates mapped color with background (e.g., 8,2,8,2... instead of solid 2,2,2), creating striped noise rather than consolidated blocks— this mismatches expected solid runs (e.g., train1 row3 generated has single 2's/4's separated by 8's, but expected has [2,2,2] and [4,4,4]; unknown why alternation was chosen, but it's clearly wrong).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated rows 2-4/6-8/10-12 show alternating patterns (e.g., row2: 8,2,8,2,8,4... ) vs expected grouped blocks (e.g., row3: 8,2,2,2,8,4,4,4...); rows 4/8/12 in generated are identical to row2 but expected varies (e.g., row4 has 2,2,2 and 8,8,4,8,8); lower section (rows10-12) alternates 8,2,8,2... vs expected solid 2,2,2 and 4,4,4.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated keeps single interspersed colors (e.g., row2: 1,4,1,4,1... with 1 as bg?) vs expected solid blocks (e.g., row2: 1,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7...); all inner rows in generated repeat the scattered pattern without grouping, missing vertical block alignment.
 * Test output generated with similar issues: Borders correct (full 5's top/bottom, sides), but inners alternate 4 (bg?) with singles like 2/6/7 (e.g., row2: 4,4,... but then 4,2,4,2... vs likely expected solid 2's; row8: 4,2,4,2... vs expected blocks; row14: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's)—this does not look correct, as it preserves input noise (scattered 2's/6's/7's) instead of consolidating into shapes, making the output look fragmented rather than a clean puzzle design.
 * extract_mappings is helpful but underutilizes (only pairs adjacent runs, may miss multi-step mappings); _find_run is useful for borders but only grabs longest—could extend to all 5-runs for better overlap.
 * build_output is broken (alternation logic creates wrong patterns) and not helpful—avoid reusing; no object extraction function present, but one might be needed to group vertical shapes across rows for block consolidation.
 * Overall, attempt shows border/background understanding but fails core transformation (solid vs alternating), leading to all incorrect outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it frames properly with 5's but fills inners with alternating 4 (likely bg) and singletons (2,6,7), e.g., row2/3/4/5/6: repeating 4,2,4,2... which scatters the pattern instead of grouping into solid vertical/horizontal blocks of 2's (as hinted by input's repeating 2 positions).
 * Missing consolidation: e.g., rows8-12 show 4,2,4,2... and 4,6,4,6... but expected likely has solid runs like three 2's or 6's together, similar to train1/2 where scattered inputs become blocks; row14-18: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's.
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: output looks noisy and untransformed, preserving input's interspersed singles rather than simplifying to clean shapes—probably needs vertical-aware block filling or better mapping application to entire runs without alternation.
 * To handle test: Update inner fill to set full run length to mapped color (solid), and consider scanning multiple rows for object shapes if patterns span heights.

[2025-10-01 15:45:36] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a bordered grid (framed by 5s) that contains a "key" or legend in the upper section defining color mappings (e.g., one color replacing another based on adjacent runs), with the lower section being the main image to transform by applying those mappings, detecting background colors, and preserving or adjusting internal patterns without over-filling solid blocks. The output should retain sparse, patterned structures (like alternating colors or gaps) in the transformed image, rather than solidifying runs into uniform blocks.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is always framed by 5s on all sides, with top/bottom borders as full rows of 5s; identify these to crop the working area, but ensure the output includes the full frame.
 * The "key" is in the top rows (above the main image), consisting of adjacent runs of colors (at least length 2) that imply mappings (e.g., color A next to color B maps A to B); only use the first valid pair per row, and stop at 5s, but avoid mapping across the entire row if patterns are interrupted.
 * Background detection should look inside the frame (excluding borders) for uniform rows or areas of a single non-5 color to set as bg, but only in the main image section (not key); default to 0 if none, but in examples, bg seems to be a filler like 8 or 1 that gets preserved or replaced selectively.
 * Transformations apply mappings to non-bg, non-5 cells, but crucially, do not fill entire runs solidly—preserve original sparse patterns (e.g., alternating colors like 2-8-2 or gaps with 1s); over-filling into blocks is a common error, as seen in outputs.
 * Subtle: Mappings are directional (e.g., left run maps to right run) and only for distinct colors; ignore short runs (<2) or same-color adjacencies; key may span multiple rows, but mappings should be consolidated without duplicates.
 * Main image may have repeated block-like structures (e.g., horizontal bars of colors), but expected outputs introduce gaps, singles, or alternations (e.g., inserting 1s or 8s to break solids), suggesting a rule for "decoding" or outlining shapes rather than direct replacement.
 * Edge cases: If no candidates for top/bottom, default to full grid; inner areas may not be uniform for bg; test inputs have asymmetric sections (e.g., 9s only on right), so mappings must handle partial coverage without assuming symmetry.
 * 5s are always preserved as borders or dividers; non-5 colors (1-9) represent objects or fills, but transformations can "reveal" hidden patterns by replacing or removing based on key.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes pattern preservation over simplification—expected outputs look like stylized letters or icons with gaps, while generated ones look like filled pixel art.

    return out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (full 5 rows) and left/right (5 frames), as outputs preserve the 5 borders accurately in both trainings.
 * Mappings extraction partially works (e.g., seems to map some colors like 2->something, but incorrectly applies them by filling runs solidly instead of preserving gaps/alternations).
 * Background detection fails or is misapplied: In training 1, bg=8 is used but over-fills 8 areas; in training 2, bg=1 is preserved but doesn't insert gaps correctly.
 * Build_output over-simplifies transformations: In training 1, generates solid [2,2,2] and [4,4,4] blocks where expected has [2,8,2] alternations and [4,8,4]; difference is unknown but likely due to not decoding patterns via key (e.g., key implies alternating with bg).
 * In training 2, generates full [4,4,4,4] where expected has broken [4,1,4] or [7,1,1,1]; this mismatches blob shapes for unknown reason (possibly key defines gap-insertion rules missed by extract_mappings).
 * find_left_right is buggy/not fully helpful: Relies only on top row's longest 5-run, which works for symmetric frames but may fail asymmetric test inputs.
 * extract_mappings is partially helpful but broken for multi-pair keys: Only grabs first pair per row and breaks early, leading to incomplete dicts (e.g., misses 4->7, 8->something in training 2).
 * Overall attempt shows basic frame detection but fails core transformation, resulting in INCORRECT for both trainings; no object extraction function present, which might be needed for pattern preservation (e.g., connected components to detect shapes before mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It generates large solid blocks (e.g., full rows of 4s, 9s on right, 2s/6s in middle, 8s/2s at bottom) within the 5 frame, but expected likely has sparse patterns with gaps or alternations (similar to trainings, e.g., breaking 9s with 4s or inserting bg like 4 between 2s/6s), as solid fills ignore key-based decoding.
 * Specifically, upper section has unbroken [9,9,9,9,9] where expected might alternate 9 with bg=4; middle has solid [2,2,2,2,2] and [6,6,6,6,6] likely needing gaps like [2,4,2]; bottom [8,8,8,8,8] to [2,2,2,2,2] should pattern like [8,2,8] or similar.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it repeats the over-filling error from trainings—test input's asymmetry (9s only right, 2s/6s/8s in sections) suggests mappings like 9->something sparse, but output treats as solid objects without transformation subtlety.
 * To handle test, account for vertical/horizontal partial keys and pattern-breaking rules (e.g., replace based on adjacency, not whole runs).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the input grid contains borders and patterns marked by the number 5 (likely representing empty or framing space), with inner regions consisting of colored blocks (integers like 2,4,8 representing colors or objects). The goal is to extract and transform the inner content into a framed output grid, where borders are solidified with 5's, background is identified and filled appropriately, and patterned or scattered inner colors are consolidated into solid blocks of mapped or equivalent colors, preserving the overall shape and structure of the design while simplifying noisy or alternating patterns into clean, grouped regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 5 as a special border/empty marker; top and bottom borders are rows with a majority of 5's, and left/right borders are defined by overlapping runs of 5's in those border rows—subtlety: if no majority-5 rows exist, default to first and last rows, but this may not always apply if borders are partial.
 * Inner content (between borders, excluding side 5's) needs to be processed row-by-row: copy solid runs of 5 or background directly, but transform runs of other colors into solid blocks rather than alternating patterns; easy to miss that "mappings" should replace entire runs with a single target color (not alternate with background), based on adjacent color pairs in pre-border areas.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the strict inner area (rows top+1 to bottom-1, columns left+1 to right-1); subtlety: if no inner area exists, default to 0, but ensure it doesn't override borders or mapped blocks.
 * Mappings are derived from the top section (rows 0 to top inclusive): look for consecutive runs of >=2 identical non-5 colors before hitting a 5, and map the first color to the second if they differ; key subtlety: mappings are directional (color A adjacent to B maps A->B), skip single-cell runs, and stop at 5's— this may create incomplete dicts if patterns don't align perfectly, and unmapped colors should default to themselves.
 * Output framing: always create a subgrid sized to (bottom-top+1) x (right-left+1), with full 5 rows at top/bottom, full 5 columns on sides for inner rows, and fill inners by processing input rows top+1 to bottom-1, slicing columns left+1 to right, then applying background or mappings to runs without alternation.
 * Subtle elements: patterns in input may have noise like single interspersed cells or partial blocks that need consolidation (e.g., scattered 2's become solid 2-block); preserve row-specific variations without assuming uniform height for objects; handle cases where inner rows have varying run lengths or interruptions by background.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): ensure left/right overlap correctly from top/bottom 5-runs to avoid over-narrowing the frame; don't fill with alternating mapped/background as this creates striped noise instead of solid shapes; consider that expected outputs show vertical alignment of blocks across rows, suggesting object extraction or shape preservation beyond simple row-wise run processing.
 * General considerations: grids may have asymmetric patterns (e.g., train 2 has irregular block sizes), so avoid assuming symmetry; 5's inside inners should be treated as empty/background separators, not borders; test for edge cases like no mappings (fallback to original colors) or dominant background overwhelming counts.

(Note: The build_output function from the attempt is unhelpful/broken as-is, since it alternates mapped colors with background instead of filling solid blocks—do not reuse without fixing the inner fill loop to set entire run to mappings.get(val, val) without %2 alternation. No types like classes were used, but Tuple/Dict from typing are helpful for return types.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0 and 14 in train1/test, matching expected full-5 rows) and left/right via 5-run overlaps, producing framed outputs with correct dimensions and side 5-columns.
 * What worked: Border framing is solid (full 5's on top/bottom/sides), background detection seems accurate (e.g., 8 as bg in train1, 1 in train2, 4 in test), and mappings extraction partially works (identifies some color pairs like potentially 2->4 or similar, but application fails).
 * What didn't work: Inner filling alternates mapped color with background (e.g., 8,2,8,2... instead of solid 2,2,2), creating striped noise rather than consolidated blocks— this mismatches expected solid runs (e.g., train1 row3 generated has single 2's/4's separated by 8's, but expected has [2,2,2] and [4,4,4]; unknown why alternation was chosen, but it's clearly wrong).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated rows 2-4/6-8/10-12 show alternating patterns (e.g., row2: 8,2,8,2,8,4... ) vs expected grouped blocks (e.g., row3: 8,2,2,2,8,4,4,4...); rows 4/8/12 in generated are identical to row2 but expected varies (e.g., row4 has 2,2,2 and 8,8,4,8,8); lower section (rows10-12) alternates 8,2,8,2... vs expected solid 2,2,2 and 4,4,4.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated keeps single interspersed colors (e.g., row2: 1,4,1,4,1... with 1 as bg?) vs expected solid blocks (e.g., row2: 1,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7...); all inner rows in generated repeat the scattered pattern without grouping, missing vertical block alignment.
 * Test output generated with similar issues: Borders correct (full 5's top/bottom, sides), but inners alternate 4 (bg?) with singles like 2/6/7 (e.g., row2: 4,4,... but then 4,2,4,2... vs likely expected solid 2's; row8: 4,2,4,2... vs expected blocks; row14: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's)—this does not look correct, as it preserves input noise (scattered 2's/6's/7's) instead of consolidating into shapes, making the output look fragmented rather than a clean puzzle design.
 * extract_mappings is helpful but underutilizes (only pairs adjacent runs, may miss multi-step mappings); _find_run is useful for borders but only grabs longest—could extend to all 5-runs for better overlap.
 * build_output is broken (alternation logic creates wrong patterns) and not helpful—avoid reusing; no object extraction function present, but one might be needed to group vertical shapes across rows for block consolidation.
 * Overall, attempt shows border/background understanding but fails core transformation (solid vs alternating), leading to all incorrect outputs.

 * The generated test output does not look correct: it frames properly with 5's but fills inners with alternating 4 (likely bg) and singletons (2,6,7), e.g., row2/3/4/5/6: repeating 4,2,4,2... which scatters the pattern instead of grouping into solid vertical/horizontal blocks of 2's (as hinted by input's repeating 2 positions).
 * Missing consolidation: e.g., rows8-12 show 4,2,4,2... and 4,6,4,6... but expected likely has solid runs like three 2's or 6's together, similar to train1/2 where scattered inputs become blocks; row14-18: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's.
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: output looks noisy and untransformed, preserving input's interspersed singles rather than simplifying to clean shapes—probably needs vertical-aware block filling or better mapping application to entire runs without alternation.
 * To handle test: Update inner fill to set full run length to mapped color (solid), and consider scanning multiple rows for object shapes if patterns span heights.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:57:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-9, with 5 as a special frame/border color) that represents a framed artwork or pattern; the goal is to extract and transform the internal content into a stylized output with a consistent 5-border frame on all sides, while remapping and restructuring internal colors/patterns based on a "legend" or pairing rules derived from the area above the frame, preserving blocky or run-based structures rather than thinning them.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a frame defined by runs of 5s: top and bottom rows are mostly or fully 5s, left and right edges within the frame are 5s, creating a bounded inner area.
 * Background color (bg) is the most common non-5 color inside the frame (excluding borders); it's used to fill spaces but not treated as a mappable color.
 * A "legend" area above the top frame row contains pairs of colored runs (sequences of >=2 identical non-5, non-bg cells) that imply color mappings (e.g., from one color to another), but mappings must be derived carefully—simple sorting or reversing doesn't always work, and the number of pairs (e.g., 2) may trigger special handling like reversal, but this seems inconsistent.
 * Internal transformation: Runs of mapped colors inside the frame should be preserved as solid blocks or partially filled, not thinned to outlines; for example, a run of 3+ same color becomes a block of that mapped color, but subtleties include handling varying run lengths, interruptions by bg or 5, and ensuring symmetry or pattern mirroring across rows/sections.
 * Output structure: Always starts/ends with full-5 rows; inner output rows (top+1 to bottom-1) are prefixed/suffixed with 5s, and the inner content is sliced from left+1 to right-1 of input, then transformed (no direct copying).
 * Subtle elements: Pairs in legend must be adjacent runs of different colors, both >=2 length, skipping bg/5; mappings apply only to non-bg/5 colors with runs >=2 in inner area—single cells may stay unmapped or be treated as bg. Patterns often have vertical alignment or repetition across row groups (e.g., 3-row blocks), and expected outputs show filled runs (e.g., 2,2,2) where input might have scattered or partial fills. Frame detection must handle partial 5-runs (e.g., > half row is 5). No modification to frame itself. Handle empty/edge cases (empty grid returns empty).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_top_bottom(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Detects top/bottom frame rows by majority 5s (> half row length); falls back to first/last if none.

    from_set = set(f for f, _ in pairs)
    to_set = set(t for _, t in pairs)
    froms = sorted(from_set)
    tos = sorted(to_set)
    if len(pairs) == 2:
        tos = sorted(to_set, reverse=True)
    return dict(zip(froms, tos))
```

```python
def transform_row(inner_row: List[int], mappings: Dict[int, int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    # Thins runs >=2 of mapped colors to single color on each side with bg fill in middle (outlining). Broken—expected outputs preserve full blocks/runs (e.g., 2,2,2 not 2,bg,2); treats all runs the same regardless of length/context; ignores vertical patterns across rows.
    out = []
    j = 0
    m = len(inner_row)
    while j < m:
        val = inner_row[j]
        run_start = j
        while j < m and inner_row[j] == val:
            j += 1
        l = j - run_start

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) correctly detects frame bounds (top/bottom via majority 5s, left/right via max 5-run overlap) and bg color in both trainings and test.
 * Extract_pairs identifies legend pairs, but get_mappings derives incorrect substitutions (e.g., in train1, likely maps 2->4 and 4->2 wrongly, leading to swapped positions; in train2, mappings like 4->7?, but generated shows no filling).
 * Transform_row thins all inner runs >=2 to outlines (e.g., for a run of 3: color,bg,color), but expected preserves solid blocks (e.g., train1 row2 expected [8,2,8,2,...] but generated [8,4,8,4,...] with singles; train1 row3 expected [8,2,2,2,8,4,4,4,...] but generated repeats single [8,4,8,4,...] across rows without filling).
 * Train1: Generated mismatches in inner patterns—e.g., row3 has scattered singles like 4,8,2 but expected has grouped blocks like 2,2,2 and 4,4,4; lower sections (rows7-9) fill some 8s but still single 2/4; bottom legend application wrong (e.g., row11 generated [8,4,8,4,...] but expected [8,2,8,2,...]). Unknown why some rows copy patterns without transformation.
 * Train2: Similar thinning issue—generated row3 [1,4,1,1,4,1,...] with singles/interruptions, but expected [1,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7,...] with full 4-run blocks; mappings seem ignored or partial (no 7s appear in generated); repeats pattern across row groups without vertical consolidation.
 * Overall: Frame and bg work well, but legend mapping and inner transformation fail to produce blocky/filled structures; no handling for multi-row pattern alignment or run merging vertically.
 * Function get_mappings is broken (arbitrary sorting/reversal doesn't capture pair intent, e.g., first color maps to second?); transform_row is incorrect/not relevant (outlining doesn't match block preservation—don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it applies the same flawed thinning to all inner rows, resulting in sparse singles like [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,...] and [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,2,4,...] with presumed bg=4 filling gaps, but expected likely has filled blocks similar to trainings (e.g., groups of 6,6,6 or 9,9,9,9 based on input runs, with correct mappings from legend pairs like (6,2)? (9,1)? (7,2)? applied to create solid sections in upper/lower parts).
 * Differences: Upper inner rows (e.g., generated row3 [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,4,4,4,9,4,5]) show interrupted singles (6 then 4s then 9), but expected would consolidate input's vertical 6/9 columns into blocks (e.g., 6,6,6 or similar); middle rows have no filling (e.g., row9 [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,2,4,4,4,2,4,1,...] scatters 2/1 without grouping); lower rows (e.g., row15 [4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,7,4,2,...]) thin 7/2 to singles, but expected probably fills like 7,7,7 or 2,2,2,2. No vertical pattern recognition, leading to repetitive but non-blocky output; mappings likely wrong (e.g., if legend pairs 6->something, it doesn't apply visibly). To handle test, need block-preserving transform and accurate pair-to-mapping logic (e.g., direct from-to without sorting).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 15:58:05] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two training examples (Train input 1/output 1 and Train input 2/output 2), the following interactions and connections are **obvious and consistent across EVERY example**. These focus solely on elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other (e.g., via position transformations, property changes like pixel count, or presence/absence) in a repeatable way. Only properties with direct, verifiable links are included—no speculation, high-level interpretations, or forced connections. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated small shapes without clear cross-example transformation rules) are excluded. Transformations for small polyomino-like or letter-like components (e.g., color shifts like Green/Red/Pink to Yellow/Red/Maroon, or position rearrangements) are not obviously consistent or explainable without puzzle-solving, so they are noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Orange Frame (color=Orange, holes=1) → Bounding Box Normalization**
   - **Description**: This component is a rectangular border/frame enclosing inner patterns. Its bounding box position interacts with a transformation rule that normalizes it relative to a top-left origin.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox) → Position (bbox)**: The bbox is shifted such that min_x becomes 0 and min_y becomes 0, while preserving the original width (max_x - min_x) and height (max_y - min_y). This effectively "crops" or repositions the frame to start at the absolute origin without altering its size.
       - Train 1: Input bbox=[3,8,21,22] (width=18, height=14) → Output bbox=[0,0,18,14].
       - Train 2: Input bbox=[5,8,22,20] (width=17, height=12) → Output bbox=[0,0,17,12].
     - **No change to**: holes (remains 1), pixels (unchanged), color (remains Orange).
   - **Consistency**: Applies identically in both examples; this component always appears in inputs and transformed outputs, affecting the enclosure of inner elements (e.g., it contains the inner multi-hole shape post-transformation).

#### 2. **Inner Multi-Hole Region (holes >=6, large bbox/pixels, enclosed by Orange) → Position Shift and Pixel Adjustment**
   - **Description**: This is a large, filled inner area (often Maroon or Blue) with multiple holes, positioned inside the Orange frame. It interacts with the frame's normalization by undergoing a parallel shift and a fixed pixel increase, suggesting an expansion or filling effect tied to the frame's repositioning.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox) → Position (bbox)**: The bbox is shifted such that min_x becomes 1 and min_y becomes 1, while preserving the original width (max_x - min_x) and height (max_y - min_y). This insets it by 1 unit relative to the normalized Orange frame at [0,0,...].
       - Train 1: Input bbox=[4,9,20,21] (width=16, height=12) → Output bbox=[1,1,17,13].
       - Train 2: Input bbox=[6,9,21,19] (width=15, height=10) → Output bbox=[1,1,16,11].
     - **Pixels → Pixels**: Pixels increase by exactly +20, possibly representing added fill or border integration (interacts with the Orange frame's presence).
       - Train 1: Input pixels=131 → Output pixels=151 (+20).
       - Train 2: Input pixels=80 → Output pixels=100 (+20).
     - **No change to**: holes (remains >=6), color (same as input, e.g., Maroon→Maroon, Blue→Blue).
   - **Consistency**: Applies identically in both examples; this component always appears in inputs (inside Orange) and transformed outputs (nested within the normalized Orange). The +20 pixel change is fixed and independent of size/color.

#### 3. **Outermost Frame (large bbox covering ~[0,0,...], holes=2-3, high pixels) → Removal**
   - **Description**: This is the largest enclosing shape (often Maroon or Blue), covering the entire composition with low hole count. It interacts with the overall output generation by being entirely absent, suggesting it's a static background or discarded container not affecting inner transformations.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Presence → Absence**: The entire component (including bbox, holes, pixels, color) is removed from the output, with no trace or transformation. Inner elements (Orange and multi-hole region) are extracted independently.
       - Train 1: Input Maroon (holes=2, bbox=[0,0,23,22], pixels=229) → Absent in output.
       - Train 2: Input Blue (holes=3, bbox=[0,0,22,21], pixels=198) → Absent in output.
     - **No other changes**: Does not affect pixels, holes, or positions of other components (e.g., Orange normalization happens independently).
   - **Consistency**: Applies identically in both examples; always present in inputs as the top-level enclosure but completely omitted in outputs.

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Interactions
- Small components (e.g., 1x1 to 2x2 colored squares/blocks in Green/Blue/Red/Yellow/Pink, or L/U-shaped polyominoes with pixels=5-16): These appear in grids/clusters in inputs and outputs, with potential position shifts (e.g., y+1 or x adjustments) and color changes (e.g., Green→Yellow, Red→Dark Red). However, no obvious, consistent rule (e.g., position→color, hole count→transform, or pixels preservation) applies across both examples—pixels vary unpredictably (e.g., 9→6, 14→12), positions do not follow a fixed offset, and colors lack a repeatable mapping. Cannot explain without further puzzle context; treated as non-interconnected or irrelevant to core transformations.
- Grid layouts/borders (e.g., 3x3 matrices or empty cells): Appear variably but show no consistent interaction (e.g., no fixed effect on movement or filling across examples).
- Hole count in small shapes: Always 0 in relevant components; no consistent effect on other properties (e.g., no hole→color or hole→position link).

These are the only elements with clear, consistent interactions (e.g., frame→inner position dependencies, fixed pixel adjustments). No other connections (e.g., color→shape, silhouette→movement) are obvious or uniform across all examples.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 15:59:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a bordered grid (framed by 5s) that contains a "key" or legend in the upper section defining color mappings (e.g., one color replacing another based on adjacent runs), with the lower section being the main image to transform by applying those mappings, detecting background colors, and preserving or adjusting internal patterns without over-filling solid blocks. The output should retain sparse, patterned structures (like alternating colors or gaps) in the transformed image, rather than solidifying runs into uniform blocks.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is always framed by 5s on all sides, with top/bottom borders as full rows of 5s; identify these to crop the working area, but ensure the output includes the full frame.
 * The "key" is in the top rows (above the main image), consisting of adjacent runs of colors (at least length 2) that imply mappings (e.g., color A next to color B maps A to B); only use the first valid pair per row, and stop at 5s, but avoid mapping across the entire row if patterns are interrupted.
 * Background detection should look inside the frame (excluding borders) for uniform rows or areas of a single non-5 color to set as bg, but only in the main image section (not key); default to 0 if none, but in examples, bg seems to be a filler like 8 or 1 that gets preserved or replaced selectively.
 * Transformations apply mappings to non-bg, non-5 cells, but crucially, do not fill entire runs solidly—preserve original sparse patterns (e.g., alternating colors like 2-8-2 or gaps with 1s); over-filling into blocks is a common error, as seen in outputs.
 * Subtle: Mappings are directional (e.g., left run maps to right run) and only for distinct colors; ignore short runs (<2) or same-color adjacencies; key may span multiple rows, but mappings should be consolidated without duplicates.
 * Main image may have repeated block-like structures (e.g., horizontal bars of colors), but expected outputs introduce gaps, singles, or alternations (e.g., inserting 1s or 8s to break solids), suggesting a rule for "decoding" or outlining shapes rather than direct replacement.
 * Edge cases: If no candidates for top/bottom, default to full grid; inner areas may not be uniform for bg; test inputs have asymmetric sections (e.g., 9s only on right), so mappings must handle partial coverage without assuming symmetry.
 * 5s are always preserved as borders or dividers; non-5 colors (1-9) represent objects or fills, but transformations can "reveal" hidden patterns by replacing or removing based on key.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes pattern preservation over simplification—expected outputs look like stylized letters or icons with gaps, while generated ones look like filled pixel art.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

# Useful for identifying frame borders; works well if >half row is 5s, with fallback to full grid.
def find_top_bottom(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:

    for i in range(len(g)):
        count_5 = sum(1 for x in g[i] if x == 5)
        if count_5 > row_len // 2:
            candidates.append(i)
    if not candidates:
        return 0, len(g) - 1
    return min(candidates), max(candidates)
```

def find_left_right(g: List[List[int]], top: int, bottom: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    row = g[top]  # Issue: Only uses top row; should scan frame edges.
    n = len(row)
    max_len = 0
    curr_len = 0

    end = 0
    curr_start = 0
    for j in range(n + 1):

                end = j
        else:
            curr_len = 0
    return start, end
```

```python
# Helpful for extracting mappings from key rows, but broken: Assumes only first pair per row, skips short runs, stops at 5s correctly, but over-simplifies by breaking after first mapping and not consolidating across rows; misses multi-pair keys.

                break  # Issue: Only first pair; should collect all valid pairs.
    return mappings
```

```python

                out[i][j] = mappings.get(val, val)  # Issue: Direct replace fills patterns solidly.
    return out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (full 5 rows) and left/right (5 frames), as outputs preserve the 5 borders accurately in both trainings.
 * Mappings extraction partially works (e.g., seems to map some colors like 2->something, but incorrectly applies them by filling runs solidly instead of preserving gaps/alternations).
 * Background detection fails or is misapplied: In training 1, bg=8 is used but over-fills 8 areas; in training 2, bg=1 is preserved but doesn't insert gaps correctly.
 * Build_output over-simplifies transformations: In training 1, generates solid [2,2,2] and [4,4,4] blocks where expected has [2,8,2] alternations and [4,8,4]; difference is unknown but likely due to not decoding patterns via key (e.g., key implies alternating with bg).
 * In training 2, generates full [4,4,4,4] where expected has broken [4,1,4] or [7,1,1,1]; this mismatches blob shapes for unknown reason (possibly key defines gap-insertion rules missed by extract_mappings).
 * find_left_right is buggy/not fully helpful: Relies only on top row's longest 5-run, which works for symmetric frames but may fail asymmetric test inputs.
 * extract_mappings is partially helpful but broken for multi-pair keys: Only grabs first pair per row and breaks early, leading to incomplete dicts (e.g., misses 4->7, 8->something in training 2).
 * Overall attempt shows basic frame detection but fails core transformation, resulting in INCORRECT for both trainings; no object extraction function present, which might be needed for pattern preservation (e.g., connected components to detect shapes before mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It generates large solid blocks (e.g., full rows of 4s, 9s on right, 2s/6s in middle, 8s/2s at bottom) within the 5 frame, but expected likely has sparse patterns with gaps or alternations (similar to trainings, e.g., breaking 9s with 4s or inserting bg like 4 between 2s/6s), as solid fills ignore key-based decoding.
 * Specifically, upper section has unbroken [9,9,9,9,9] where expected might alternate 9 with bg=4; middle has solid [2,2,2,2,2] and [6,6,6,6,6] likely needing gaps like [2,4,2]; bottom [8,8,8,8,8] to [2,2,2,2,2] should pattern like [8,2,8] or similar.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it repeats the over-filling error from trainings—test input's asymmetry (9s only right, 2s/6s/8s in sections) suggests mappings like 9->something sparse, but output treats as solid objects without transformation subtlety.
 * To handle test, account for vertical/horizontal partial keys and pattern-breaking rules (e.g., replace based on adjacency, not whole runs).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-9, with 5 as a special frame/border color) that represents a framed artwork or pattern; the goal is to extract and transform the internal content into a stylized output with a consistent 5-border frame on all sides, while remapping and restructuring internal colors/patterns based on a "legend" or pairing rules derived from the area above the frame, preserving blocky or run-based structures rather than thinning them.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a frame defined by runs of 5s: top and bottom rows are mostly or fully 5s, left and right edges within the frame are 5s, creating a bounded inner area.
 * Background color (bg) is the most common non-5 color inside the frame (excluding borders); it's used to fill spaces but not treated as a mappable color.
 * A "legend" area above the top frame row contains pairs of colored runs (sequences of >=2 identical non-5, non-bg cells) that imply color mappings (e.g., from one color to another), but mappings must be derived carefully—simple sorting or reversing doesn't always work, and the number of pairs (e.g., 2) may trigger special handling like reversal, but this seems inconsistent.
 * Internal transformation: Runs of mapped colors inside the frame should be preserved as solid blocks or partially filled, not thinned to outlines; for example, a run of 3+ same color becomes a block of that mapped color, but subtleties include handling varying run lengths, interruptions by bg or 5, and ensuring symmetry or pattern mirroring across rows/sections.
 * Output structure: Always starts/ends with full-5 rows; inner output rows (top+1 to bottom-1) are prefixed/suffixed with 5s, and the inner content is sliced from left+1 to right-1 of input, then transformed (no direct copying).
 * Subtle elements: Pairs in legend must be adjacent runs of different colors, both >=2 length, skipping bg/5; mappings apply only to non-bg/5 colors with runs >=2 in inner area—single cells may stay unmapped or be treated as bg. Patterns often have vertical alignment or repetition across row groups (e.g., 3-row blocks), and expected outputs show filled runs (e.g., 2,2,2) where input might have scattered or partial fills. Frame detection must handle partial 5-runs (e.g., > half row is 5). No modification to frame itself. Handle empty/edge cases (empty grid returns empty).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) correctly detects frame bounds (top/bottom via majority 5s, left/right via max 5-run overlap) and bg color in both trainings and test.
 * Extract_pairs identifies legend pairs, but get_mappings derives incorrect substitutions (e.g., in train1, likely maps 2->4 and 4->2 wrongly, leading to swapped positions; in train2, mappings like 4->7?, but generated shows no filling).
 * Transform_row thins all inner runs >=2 to outlines (e.g., for a run of 3: color,bg,color), but expected preserves solid blocks (e.g., train1 row2 expected [8,2,8,2,...] but generated [8,4,8,4,...] with singles; train1 row3 expected [8,2,2,2,8,4,4,4,...] but generated repeats single [8,4,8,4,...] across rows without filling).
 * Train1: Generated mismatches in inner patterns—e.g., row3 has scattered singles like 4,8,2 but expected has grouped blocks like 2,2,2 and 4,4,4; lower sections (rows7-9) fill some 8s but still single 2/4; bottom legend application wrong (e.g., row11 generated [8,4,8,4,...] but expected [8,2,8,2,...]). Unknown why some rows copy patterns without transformation.
 * Train2: Similar thinning issue—generated row3 [1,4,1,1,4,1,...] with singles/interruptions, but expected [1,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7,...] with full 4-run blocks; mappings seem ignored or partial (no 7s appear in generated); repeats pattern across row groups without vertical consolidation.
 * Overall: Frame and bg work well, but legend mapping and inner transformation fail to produce blocky/filled structures; no handling for multi-row pattern alignment or run merging vertically.
 * Function get_mappings is broken (arbitrary sorting/reversal doesn't capture pair intent, e.g., first color maps to second?); transform_row is incorrect/not relevant (outlining doesn't match block preservation—don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it applies the same flawed thinning to all inner rows, resulting in sparse singles like [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,...] and [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,2,4,...] with presumed bg=4 filling gaps, but expected likely has filled blocks similar to trainings (e.g., groups of 6,6,6 or 9,9,9,9 based on input runs, with correct mappings from legend pairs like (6,2)? (9,1)? (7,2)? applied to create solid sections in upper/lower parts).
 * Differences: Upper inner rows (e.g., generated row3 [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,4,4,4,9,4,5]) show interrupted singles (6 then 4s then 9), but expected would consolidate input's vertical 6/9 columns into blocks (e.g., 6,6,6 or similar); middle rows have no filling (e.g., row9 [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,2,4,4,4,2,4,1,...] scatters 2/1 without grouping); lower rows (e.g., row15 [4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,7,4,2,...]) thin 7/2 to singles, but expected probably fills like 7,7,7 or 2,2,2,2. No vertical pattern recognition, leading to repetitive but non-blocky output; mappings likely wrong (e.g., if legend pairs 6->something, it doesn't apply visibly). To handle test, need block-preserving transform and accurate pair-to-mapping logic (e.g., direct from-to without sorting).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the input grid contains borders and patterns marked by the number 5 (likely representing empty or framing space), with inner regions consisting of colored blocks (integers like 2,4,8 representing colors or objects). The goal is to extract and transform the inner content into a framed output grid, where borders are solidified with 5's, background is identified and filled appropriately, and patterned or scattered inner colors are consolidated into solid blocks of mapped or equivalent colors, preserving the overall shape and structure of the design while simplifying noisy or alternating patterns into clean, grouped regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 5 as a special border/empty marker; top and bottom borders are rows with a majority of 5's, and left/right borders are defined by overlapping runs of 5's in those border rows—subtlety: if no majority-5 rows exist, default to first and last rows, but this may not always apply if borders are partial.
 * Inner content (between borders, excluding side 5's) needs to be processed row-by-row: copy solid runs of 5 or background directly, but transform runs of other colors into solid blocks rather than alternating patterns; easy to miss that "mappings" should replace entire runs with a single target color (not alternate with background), based on adjacent color pairs in pre-border areas.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the strict inner area (rows top+1 to bottom-1, columns left+1 to right-1); subtlety: if no inner area exists, default to 0, but ensure it doesn't override borders or mapped blocks.
 * Mappings are derived from the top section (rows 0 to top inclusive): look for consecutive runs of >=2 identical non-5 colors before hitting a 5, and map the first color to the second if they differ; key subtlety: mappings are directional (color A adjacent to B maps A->B), skip single-cell runs, and stop at 5's— this may create incomplete dicts if patterns don't align perfectly, and unmapped colors should default to themselves.
 * Output framing: always create a subgrid sized to (bottom-top+1) x (right-left+1), with full 5 rows at top/bottom, full 5 columns on sides for inner rows, and fill inners by processing input rows top+1 to bottom-1, slicing columns left+1 to right, then applying background or mappings to runs without alternation.
 * Subtle elements: patterns in input may have noise like single interspersed cells or partial blocks that need consolidation (e.g., scattered 2's become solid 2-block); preserve row-specific variations without assuming uniform height for objects; handle cases where inner rows have varying run lengths or interruptions by background.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): ensure left/right overlap correctly from top/bottom 5-runs to avoid over-narrowing the frame; don't fill with alternating mapped/background as this creates striped noise instead of solid shapes; consider that expected outputs show vertical alignment of blocks across rows, suggesting object extraction or shape preservation beyond simple row-wise run processing.
 * General considerations: grids may have asymmetric patterns (e.g., train 2 has irregular block sizes), so avoid assuming symmetry; 5's inside inners should be treated as empty/background separators, not borders; test for edge cases like no mappings (fallback to original colors) or dominant background overwhelming counts.

(Note: The build_output function from the attempt is unhelpful/broken as-is, since it alternates mapped colors with background instead of filling solid blocks—do not reuse without fixing the inner fill loop to set entire run to mappings.get(val, val) without %2 alternation. No types like classes were used, but Tuple/Dict from typing are helpful for return types.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0 and 14 in train1/test, matching expected full-5 rows) and left/right via 5-run overlaps, producing framed outputs with correct dimensions and side 5-columns.
 * What worked: Border framing is solid (full 5's on top/bottom/sides), background detection seems accurate (e.g., 8 as bg in train1, 1 in train2, 4 in test), and mappings extraction partially works (identifies some color pairs like potentially 2->4 or similar, but application fails).
 * What didn't work: Inner filling alternates mapped color with background (e.g., 8,2,8,2... instead of solid 2,2,2), creating striped noise rather than consolidated blocks— this mismatches expected solid runs (e.g., train1 row3 generated has single 2's/4's separated by 8's, but expected has [2,2,2] and [4,4,4]; unknown why alternation was chosen, but it's clearly wrong).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated rows 2-4/6-8/10-12 show alternating patterns (e.g., row2: 8,2,8,2,8,4... ) vs expected grouped blocks (e.g., row3: 8,2,2,2,8,4,4,4...); rows 4/8/12 in generated are identical to row2 but expected varies (e.g., row4 has 2,2,2 and 8,8,4,8,8); lower section (rows10-12) alternates 8,2,8,2... vs expected solid 2,2,2 and 4,4,4.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated keeps single interspersed colors (e.g., row2: 1,4,1,4,1... with 1 as bg?) vs expected solid blocks (e.g., row2: 1,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7...); all inner rows in generated repeat the scattered pattern without grouping, missing vertical block alignment.
 * Test output generated with similar issues: Borders correct (full 5's top/bottom, sides), but inners alternate 4 (bg?) with singles like 2/6/7 (e.g., row2: 4,4,... but then 4,2,4,2... vs likely expected solid 2's; row8: 4,2,4,2... vs expected blocks; row14: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's)—this does not look correct, as it preserves input noise (scattered 2's/6's/7's) instead of consolidating into shapes, making the output look fragmented rather than a clean puzzle design.
 * extract_mappings is helpful but underutilizes (only pairs adjacent runs, may miss multi-step mappings); _find_run is useful for borders but only grabs longest—could extend to all 5-runs for better overlap.
 * build_output is broken (alternation logic creates wrong patterns) and not helpful—avoid reusing; no object extraction function present, but one might be needed to group vertical shapes across rows for block consolidation.
 * Overall, attempt shows border/background understanding but fails core transformation (solid vs alternating), leading to all incorrect outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it frames properly with 5's but fills inners with alternating 4 (likely bg) and singletons (2,6,7), e.g., row2/3/4/5/6: repeating 4,2,4,2... which scatters the pattern instead of grouping into solid vertical/horizontal blocks of 2's (as hinted by input's repeating 2 positions).
 * Missing consolidation: e.g., rows8-12 show 4,2,4,2... and 4,6,4,6... but expected likely has solid runs like three 2's or 6's together, similar to train1/2 where scattered inputs become blocks; row14-18: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's.
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: output looks noisy and untransformed, preserving input's interspersed singles rather than simplifying to clean shapes—probably needs vertical-aware block filling or better mapping application to entire runs without alternation.
 * To handle test: Update inner fill to set full run length to mapped color (solid), and consider scanning multiple rows for object shapes if patterns span heights.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two training examples (Train input 1/output 1 and Train input 2/output 2), the following interactions and connections are **obvious and consistent across EVERY example**. These focus solely on elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other (e.g., via position transformations, property changes like pixel count, or presence/absence) in a repeatable way. Only properties with direct, verifiable links are included—no speculation, high-level interpretations, or forced connections. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated small shapes without clear cross-example transformation rules) are excluded. Transformations for small polyomino-like or letter-like components (e.g., color shifts like Green/Red/Pink to Yellow/Red/Maroon, or position rearrangements) are not obviously consistent or explainable without puzzle-solving, so they are noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Orange Frame (color=Orange, holes=1) → Bounding Box Normalization**
   - **Description**: This component is a rectangular border/frame enclosing inner patterns. Its bounding box position interacts with a transformation rule that normalizes it relative to a top-left origin.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox) → Position (bbox)**: The bbox is shifted such that min_x becomes 0 and min_y becomes 0, while preserving the original width (max_x - min_x) and height (max_y - min_y). This effectively "crops" or repositions the frame to start at the absolute origin without altering its size.
       - Train 1: Input bbox=[3,8,21,22] (width=18, height=14) → Output bbox=[0,0,18,14].
       - Train 2: Input bbox=[5,8,22,20] (width=17, height=12) → Output bbox=[0,0,17,12].
     - **No change to**: holes (remains 1), pixels (unchanged), color (remains Orange).
   - **Consistency**: Applies identically in both examples; this component always appears in inputs and transformed outputs, affecting the enclosure of inner elements (e.g., it contains the inner multi-hole shape post-transformation).

#### 2. **Inner Multi-Hole Region (holes >=6, large bbox/pixels, enclosed by Orange) → Position Shift and Pixel Adjustment**
   - **Description**: This is a large, filled inner area (often Maroon or Blue) with multiple holes, positioned inside the Orange frame. It interacts with the frame's normalization by undergoing a parallel shift and a fixed pixel increase, suggesting an expansion or filling effect tied to the frame's repositioning.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox) → Position (bbox)**: The bbox is shifted such that min_x becomes 1 and min_y becomes 1, while preserving the original width (max_x - min_x) and height (max_y - min_y). This insets it by 1 unit relative to the normalized Orange frame at [0,0,...].
       - Train 1: Input bbox=[4,9,20,21] (width=16, height=12) → Output bbox=[1,1,17,13].
       - Train 2: Input bbox=[6,9,21,19] (width=15, height=10) → Output bbox=[1,1,16,11].
     - **Pixels → Pixels**: Pixels increase by exactly +20, possibly representing added fill or border integration (interacts with the Orange frame's presence).
       - Train 1: Input pixels=131 → Output pixels=151 (+20).
       - Train 2: Input pixels=80 → Output pixels=100 (+20).
     - **No change to**: holes (remains >=6), color (same as input, e.g., Maroon→Maroon, Blue→Blue).
   - **Consistency**: Applies identically in both examples; this component always appears in inputs (inside Orange) and transformed outputs (nested within the normalized Orange). The +20 pixel change is fixed and independent of size/color.

#### 3. **Outermost Frame (large bbox covering ~[0,0,...], holes=2-3, high pixels) → Removal**
   - **Description**: This is the largest enclosing shape (often Maroon or Blue), covering the entire composition with low hole count. It interacts with the overall output generation by being entirely absent, suggesting it's a static background or discarded container not affecting inner transformations.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Presence → Absence**: The entire component (including bbox, holes, pixels, color) is removed from the output, with no trace or transformation. Inner elements (Orange and multi-hole region) are extracted independently.
       - Train 1: Input Maroon (holes=2, bbox=[0,0,23,22], pixels=229) → Absent in output.
       - Train 2: Input Blue (holes=3, bbox=[0,0,22,21], pixels=198) → Absent in output.
     - **No other changes**: Does not affect pixels, holes, or positions of other components (e.g., Orange normalization happens independently).
   - **Consistency**: Applies identically in both examples; always present in inputs as the top-level enclosure but completely omitted in outputs.

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Interactions
- Small components (e.g., 1x1 to 2x2 colored squares/blocks in Green/Blue/Red/Yellow/Pink, or L/U-shaped polyominoes with pixels=5-16): These appear in grids/clusters in inputs and outputs, with potential position shifts (e.g., y+1 or x adjustments) and color changes (e.g., Green→Yellow, Red→Dark Red). However, no obvious, consistent rule (e.g., position→color, hole count→transform, or pixels preservation) applies across both examples—pixels vary unpredictably (e.g., 9→6, 14→12), positions do not follow a fixed offset, and colors lack a repeatable mapping. Cannot explain without further puzzle context; treated as non-interconnected or irrelevant to core transformations.
- Grid layouts/borders (e.g., 3x3 matrices or empty cells): Appear variably but show no consistent interaction (e.g., no fixed effect on movement or filling across examples).
- Hole count in small shapes: Always 0 in relevant components; no consistent effect on other properties (e.g., no hole→color or hole→position link).

These are the only elements with clear, consistent interactions (e.g., frame→inner position dependencies, fixed pixel adjustments). No other connections (e.g., color→shape, silhouette→movement) are obvious or uniform across all examples.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 16:07:31] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a framed grid where the top section acts as a color mapping legend, the middle contains stacked patterns of objects on a background, and the goal is to transform the inner content by applying mappings to object colors while rendering multi-row objects with outlines (perimeter only, filled with background inside) rather than solid fills, ultimately outputting a new grid with the frame preserved.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame is always color 5, spanning top and bottom rows fully, with left/right edges in the inner content; detect top/bottom as rows with majority 5's, falling back to first/last if none.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the inner area (excluding frame edges); it's used to fill non-object spaces and insides of outlined objects.
 * Mappings are derived from the top legend rows (above the main content): they pair consecutive runs of distinct non-5/non-bg colors (run length >=2) where one color "points to" or precedes another, creating a dict like {source_color: target_color}.
 * Inner content consists of stacked horizontal runs of identical rows forming "objects" or full-bg rows; full-bg stacks should output as solid bg rows, and separate pattern stacks with a bg separator if followed by another pattern.
 * For each pattern stack of height h: if h==1, render full solid runs using mapped colors (bg runs stay bg); if h>1, render only the perimeter outline of the object using mapped colors (top/bottom/full rows outlined, sides implied by stacking), with interior filled as bg—subtle: outlines apply to the entire stack's shape, not just the first row, and single-cell runs in outlines should be preserved as mapped color without expansion.
 * Objects don't overlap or interact; process stacks independently, but ensure left/right frame (5's) are added to each output row.
 * Subtle: mappings are directional (from left run to right run in legend) and only for adjacent distinct colors with run len>=2; ignore bg/5 in mapping extraction.
 * Easy to miss: for multi-row objects, the "outline" means hollowing the interior (bg fill) across all rows except edges, but generated code only hollows the top row partially (using a minimal mask of just ends), leading to solid fills below.
 * Stacks must detect exact row equality for grouping; insert bg separators only between pattern stacks, not after full-bg or at ends.
 * Width of inner content is frame-constrained (left+1 to right-1); output width matches input frame width.
 * Colors are integers 1-9 typically; no rotation or symmetry assumed.

            if next_len < 2 or next_color == color:
                continue
            if color not in mappings:
                mappings[color] = next_color
    return mappings
```

```python
def get_outline_mask(l: int) -> List[bool]:
    # Attempts to mask for outlines (True for edges, False for interior bg fill). Helpful concept but broken: only masks ends for any l>2, doesn't create full perimeter (e.g., for l=5, should be [T,T,F,T,T] or similar for top/bottom rows, but code does [T,F,F,F,T]).
    if l <= 2:
        return [True] * l
    mask = [False] * l
    mask[0] = True
    mask[l - 1] = True
    return mask
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects top/bottom frames, left/right edges, and background color in both training examples (bg=8 for ex1, bg=1 for ex2), preserving the 5-frame in output.
 * Stack detection for row groups works partially: it groups identical rows correctly and inserts bg separators between patterns, but treats full-bg stacks as single rows instead of height h.
 * Mapping extraction is incomplete/inaccurate: in ex1, it likely maps some colors (e.g., 2->something, 4->something) but applies them wrongly, leading to solid fills; in ex2, mappings like 4->7? are not applied correctly, resulting in unchanged or mismatched patterns.
 * Outlining logic fails core subtlety: for h>1 stacks, it only applies a minimal end-mask to the first row (k==0), then fills subsequent rows solidly with mapped color, ignoring interior bg fill—e.g., in ex1 row4, generates solid 4,4,4 and 2,2,2 instead of expected 8,4,8 (bg, mapped, bg) and similar hollow patterns.
 * In ex1, mismatches in rows 4,8,12 (0-indexed inner): generated has solid blocks like 2,2,2 / 4,4,4 where expected has interspersed bg (8) for hollowing, e.g., expected row4 has 8,4,8 instead of 4,4,4; row8 has 8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,8 vs generated solid; unknown why but likely due to no full-stack outlining.
 * In ex2, mismatches in rows 2-5,8-11 (inner): generated fills solidly like 4,4,4,4 / 7,7,7,7 / 8,8,8,8 where expected has irregular hollows/juts like 4,4,4,4 but then 7,7,1,1,1 / 7,7,7,7 / 8,1,1,8,1—suggests failed mapping application and no proper hollowing; e.g., row3 expected has 1's interrupting 7's, but generated ignores.
 * Function find_left_right is helpful but simplistic: finds overlapping 5-runs in top/bottom rows for frame width, works for these cases but may fail if no 5's in top/bottom inner.
 * Function to build stacks (grouping identical inner rows) is useful and mostly correct, but output_inner generation buggy: doesn't hollow full stack, applies mapping only to non-bg, and is_outline only for top row.
 * extract_mappings is partially helpful (catches some pairs) but broken for complex legends (e.g., skips valid pairs if followed by bg, doesn't overwrite mappings if multiple).
 * get_outline_mask is unhelpful/broken: too minimal (only edges, no interior True for sides in multi-row), doesn't differentiate top/side/bottom; don't use as-is, needs full perimeter logic per row type (top: full outline, middle: side only, bottom: full).
 * Overall, program understands frame/bg/stack structure (what worked) but fails object transformation (mappings + hollow outlining = what didn't), leading to solid blobs instead of hollow shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates solid filled objects (e.g., rows 3-6: full 9,9,9,9,9 and 2,2,2,2,2 blocks; rows 9-12: full 9's and 1,1,1,1,1 / 6,6,6,6,6; rows 15-18: full 7's and 1's) with no hollowing or interior bg (likely 4), and patterns don't match expected irregularity—e.g., upper object should probably have hollow 9's like 4,9,4 or similar based on training, but it's solid; lower parts similar. Mismatches suggest same issues as training: no full-stack outlining, possible wrong mappings (e.g., 9->? , 2->1? , etc.), and no juts/interruptions with bg. To handle test, need to apply mappings correctly (test legend likely maps 9->2? or similar, but output uses unmapped), and implement true hollowing for h>1 (e.g., middle rows: mapped on sides, bg inside).

[2025-10-01 16:07:57] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions/connections** between elements. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, position via bbox, holes, pixels) that show clear, direct effects or transformations from input to output, present in **EVERY** train example (both Train 1 and Train 2). I ignored irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the outermost large background with low holes=2 or 3, which is consistently absent in outputs and has no apparent interaction). I also excluded inconsistent or unclear connections (e.g., small shape color mappings vary—Green/Blue to Yellow/Red in Train 1 vs. Pink/Dark Red to Maroon/Yellow/Dark Red in Train 2—so no consistent color transformation is identifiable). Only interactions that hold across both trains are included. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained (e.g., exact pixel change mechanism), it is noted as unknown but the connection is still listed if the pattern is consistent.

#### 1. **Orange Rectangular Frame (holes=1) Position Transformation**
   - **Components Involved**: Orange shape with holes=1, large pixels (58–64), acting as a 1-thick border/frame (per description: rectangular frames enclosing grid sections).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The bbox position is consistently shifted to start at [0, 0], while preserving the exact width (maxx - minx) and height (maxy - miny) from the input. Pixels remain unchanged.
     - Train 1: Input bbox=[3,8,21,22] (width=18, height=14, pixels=64) → Output bbox=[0,0,18,14] (same width/height, pixels=64).
     - Train 2: Input bbox=[5,8,22,20] (width=17, height=12, pixels=58) → Output bbox=[0,0,17,12] (same width/height, pixels=58).
   - **Consistency**: Direct position → position effect; frame acts as a "container" that anchors other elements (see below). No holes or pixels change.

#### 2. **Inner Holed Background (high holes=6–10) Position and Pixel Adjustment Relative to Orange Frame**
   - **Components Involved**: Inner shape (Maroon in Train 1, Blue in Train 2) with high holes (6 or 10), medium-large pixels (80–131), positioned inside the Orange frame (per description: background fills or panels with symmetric clusters, overlaid on frames).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The bbox is shifted to start at [1, 1] (inset by 1 unit from the transformed Orange frame's [0, 0]), preserving the exact input width and height to fit as an inner border. Holes remain unchanged. Pixels consistently increase by exactly +20 (unknown mechanism—possibly filling border gaps or adding consistent area, but not explainable from data alone).
     - Train 1: Input bbox=[4,9,20,21] (width=16, height=12, holes=10, pixels=131), inside Orange [3,8,21,22] → Output bbox=[1,1,17,13] (same width/height, holes=10, pixels=151 = +20).
     - Train 2: Input bbox=[6,9,21,19] (width=15, height=10, holes=6, pixels=80), inside Orange [5,8,22,20] → Output bbox=[1,1,16,11] (same width/height, holes=6, pixels=100 = +20).
   - **Consistency**: Position of inner background is dependent on Orange frame's transformation (frame position → inner position). Forms a nested structure (Orange frame encloses/adjusts the holed background). Large outer background (low holes) has no interaction and is removed.

#### 3. **Small Polyomino-like Shapes (holes=0, low pixels=5–16) Placement into Grid-like Positions Within Transformed Frame**
   - **Components Involved**: Small shapes (e.g., L-shaped, U-shaped, T/Y-like polyominoes or tiles in colors like Green/Blue/Red/Pink/Dark Red/Yellow/Maroon, holes=0, pixels=5–16; per description: colored square tiles, L/U/T polyominoes in grid arrangements).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Select small shapes from input (not all; only specific ones with consistent low pixels and holes=0) are repositioned into structured, grid-aligned bboxes (width/height=2–4 units) inside the transformed Orange frame. Their pixels and holes=0 are preserved or slightly adjusted (e.g., +1–2 pixels in some cases, unknown why). Positions form consistent row-like patterns (e.g., at relative y-levels like 2–5, 6–10, 10–12 within the new frame), but exact selection rule (e.g., which input shapes) is unknown and varies by color/bbox. No consistent color change across trains.
     - Train 1: Input small shapes (e.g., Green/Blue/Red/Yellow at various positions, pixels=5–9) → Output small shapes (Yellow/Red, pixels=6–8) placed at grid positions like [2,2,4,4], [6,2,8,4], [10,2,12,4], [14,2,16,4], [2,6,4,8], etc., all within new frame [0,0,18,14].
     - Train 2: Input small shapes (e.g., Green/Red/Pink/Dark Red/Yellow/Maroon, pixels=5–16) → Output small shapes (Maroon/Yellow/Dark Red, pixels=12–14) placed at grid positions like [2,2,5,5], [7,2,10,5], [12,2,15,5], [2,7,5,10], etc., all within new frame [0,0,17,12].
   - **Consistency**: Small shapes' positions are affected by the Orange frame's transformation (frame bounds → small shape placement inside). They interact via containment (placed within frame/inner background). Only holes=0 small shapes are involved; no high-hole shapes among them. Irrelevant small shapes (e.g., scattered external ones not fitting grid) are omitted.

No other connections (e.g., hole count → color, specific shape silhouettes → transformation) are consistent across both trains—many small shape details (e.g., exact rotations, colors) vary without clear effects. The overall structure shows a "containment hierarchy": small polyominoes → inner holed background → Orange frame, with positions propagating from frame adjustments. For the test input, these patterns could apply, but no further speculation is made as per instructions.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 16:08:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a bordered grid (framed by 5s) that contains a "key" or legend in the upper section defining color mappings (e.g., one color replacing another based on adjacent runs), with the lower section being the main image to transform by applying those mappings, detecting background colors, and preserving or adjusting internal patterns without over-filling solid blocks. The output should retain sparse, patterned structures (like alternating colors or gaps) in the transformed image, rather than solidifying runs into uniform blocks.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is always framed by 5s on all sides, with top/bottom borders as full rows of 5s; identify these to crop the working area, but ensure the output includes the full frame.
 * The "key" is in the top rows (above the main image), consisting of adjacent runs of colors (at least length 2) that imply mappings (e.g., color A next to color B maps A to B); only use the first valid pair per row, and stop at 5s, but avoid mapping across the entire row if patterns are interrupted.
 * Background detection should look inside the frame (excluding borders) for uniform rows or areas of a single non-5 color to set as bg, but only in the main image section (not key); default to 0 if none, but in examples, bg seems to be a filler like 8 or 1 that gets preserved or replaced selectively.
 * Transformations apply mappings to non-bg, non-5 cells, but crucially, do not fill entire runs solidly—preserve original sparse patterns (e.g., alternating colors like 2-8-2 or gaps with 1s); over-filling into blocks is a common error, as seen in outputs.
 * Subtle: Mappings are directional (e.g., left run maps to right run) and only for distinct colors; ignore short runs (<2) or same-color adjacencies; key may span multiple rows, but mappings should be consolidated without duplicates.
 * Main image may have repeated block-like structures (e.g., horizontal bars of colors), but expected outputs introduce gaps, singles, or alternations (e.g., inserting 1s or 8s to break solids), suggesting a rule for "decoding" or outlining shapes rather than direct replacement.
 * Edge cases: If no candidates for top/bottom, default to full grid; inner areas may not be uniform for bg; test inputs have asymmetric sections (e.g., 9s only on right), so mappings must handle partial coverage without assuming symmetry.
 * 5s are always preserved as borders or dividers; non-5 colors (1-9) represent objects or fills, but transformations can "reveal" hidden patterns by replacing or removing based on key.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes pattern preservation over simplification—expected outputs look like stylized letters or icons with gaps, while generated ones look like filled pixel art.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

# Useful for identifying frame borders; works well if >half row is 5s, with fallback to full grid.
def find_top_bottom(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    row_len = len(g[0])
    candidates = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        count_5 = sum(1 for x in g[i] if x == 5)
        if count_5 > row_len // 2:
            candidates.append(i)
    if not candidates:
        return 0, len(g) - 1
    return min(candidates), max(candidates)
```

```python
# Partially helpful for finding horizontal 5-run borders in top row, but buggy (uses top row only, assumes longest 5-run defines left/right without checking full frame).
def find_left_right(g: List[List[int]], top: int, bottom: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    row = g[top]  # Issue: Only uses top row; should scan frame edges.
    n = len(row)
    max_len = 0
    curr_len = 0
    start = 0
    end = 0
    curr_start = 0
    for j in range(n + 1):
        if j < n and row[j] == 5:
            if curr_len == 0:
                curr_start = j
            curr_len += 1
            if curr_len > max_len:
                max_len = curr_len
                start = curr_start
                end = j
        else:
            curr_len = 0
    return start, end
```

```python

            color = row[j]
            run_start = j
            while j < n and row[j] == color:

            next_start = j
            while j < n and row[j] == next_color:
                j += 1
            next_len = j - next_start
            if next_len < 2:
                continue
            if color != next_color:
                mappings[color] = next_color
                break  # Issue: Only first pair; should collect all valid pairs.
    return mappings
```

```python

    inner_left = left + 1

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (full 5 rows) and left/right (5 frames), as outputs preserve the 5 borders accurately in both trainings.
 * Mappings extraction partially works (e.g., seems to map some colors like 2->something, but incorrectly applies them by filling runs solidly instead of preserving gaps/alternations).
 * Background detection fails or is misapplied: In training 1, bg=8 is used but over-fills 8 areas; in training 2, bg=1 is preserved but doesn't insert gaps correctly.
 * Build_output over-simplifies transformations: In training 1, generates solid [2,2,2] and [4,4,4] blocks where expected has [2,8,2] alternations and [4,8,4]; difference is unknown but likely due to not decoding patterns via key (e.g., key implies alternating with bg).
 * In training 2, generates full [4,4,4,4] where expected has broken [4,1,4] or [7,1,1,1]; this mismatches blob shapes for unknown reason (possibly key defines gap-insertion rules missed by extract_mappings).
 * find_left_right is buggy/not fully helpful: Relies only on top row's longest 5-run, which works for symmetric frames but may fail asymmetric test inputs.
 * extract_mappings is partially helpful but broken for multi-pair keys: Only grabs first pair per row and breaks early, leading to incomplete dicts (e.g., misses 4->7, 8->something in training 2).
 * Overall attempt shows basic frame detection but fails core transformation, resulting in INCORRECT for both trainings; no object extraction function present, which might be needed for pattern preservation (e.g., connected components to detect shapes before mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It generates large solid blocks (e.g., full rows of 4s, 9s on right, 2s/6s in middle, 8s/2s at bottom) within the 5 frame, but expected likely has sparse patterns with gaps or alternations (similar to trainings, e.g., breaking 9s with 4s or inserting bg like 4 between 2s/6s), as solid fills ignore key-based decoding.
 * Specifically, upper section has unbroken [9,9,9,9,9] where expected might alternate 9 with bg=4; middle has solid [2,2,2,2,2] and [6,6,6,6,6] likely needing gaps like [2,4,2]; bottom [8,8,8,8,8] to [2,2,2,2,2] should pattern like [8,2,8] or similar.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it repeats the over-filling error from trainings—test input's asymmetry (9s only right, 2s/6s/8s in sections) suggests mappings like 9->something sparse, but output treats as solid objects without transformation subtlety.
 * To handle test, account for vertical/horizontal partial keys and pattern-breaking rules (e.g., replace based on adjacency, not whole runs).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-9, with 5 as a special frame/border color) that represents a framed artwork or pattern; the goal is to extract and transform the internal content into a stylized output with a consistent 5-border frame on all sides, while remapping and restructuring internal colors/patterns based on a "legend" or pairing rules derived from the area above the frame, preserving blocky or run-based structures rather than thinning them.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a frame defined by runs of 5s: top and bottom rows are mostly or fully 5s, left and right edges within the frame are 5s, creating a bounded inner area.
 * Background color (bg) is the most common non-5 color inside the frame (excluding borders); it's used to fill spaces but not treated as a mappable color.
 * A "legend" area above the top frame row contains pairs of colored runs (sequences of >=2 identical non-5, non-bg cells) that imply color mappings (e.g., from one color to another), but mappings must be derived carefully—simple sorting or reversing doesn't always work, and the number of pairs (e.g., 2) may trigger special handling like reversal, but this seems inconsistent.
 * Internal transformation: Runs of mapped colors inside the frame should be preserved as solid blocks or partially filled, not thinned to outlines; for example, a run of 3+ same color becomes a block of that mapped color, but subtleties include handling varying run lengths, interruptions by bg or 5, and ensuring symmetry or pattern mirroring across rows/sections.
 * Output structure: Always starts/ends with full-5 rows; inner output rows (top+1 to bottom-1) are prefixed/suffixed with 5s, and the inner content is sliced from left+1 to right-1 of input, then transformed (no direct copying).
 * Subtle elements: Pairs in legend must be adjacent runs of different colors, both >=2 length, skipping bg/5; mappings apply only to non-bg/5 colors with runs >=2 in inner area—single cells may stay unmapped or be treated as bg. Patterns often have vertical alignment or repetition across row groups (e.g., 3-row blocks), and expected outputs show filled runs (e.g., 2,2,2) where input might have scattered or partial fills. Frame detection must handle partial 5-runs (e.g., > half row is 5). No modification to frame itself. Handle empty/edge cases (empty grid returns empty).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) correctly detects frame bounds (top/bottom via majority 5s, left/right via max 5-run overlap) and bg color in both trainings and test.
 * Extract_pairs identifies legend pairs, but get_mappings derives incorrect substitutions (e.g., in train1, likely maps 2->4 and 4->2 wrongly, leading to swapped positions; in train2, mappings like 4->7?, but generated shows no filling).
 * Transform_row thins all inner runs >=2 to outlines (e.g., for a run of 3: color,bg,color), but expected preserves solid blocks (e.g., train1 row2 expected [8,2,8,2,...] but generated [8,4,8,4,...] with singles; train1 row3 expected [8,2,2,2,8,4,4,4,...] but generated repeats single [8,4,8,4,...] across rows without filling).
 * Train1: Generated mismatches in inner patterns—e.g., row3 has scattered singles like 4,8,2 but expected has grouped blocks like 2,2,2 and 4,4,4; lower sections (rows7-9) fill some 8s but still single 2/4; bottom legend application wrong (e.g., row11 generated [8,4,8,4,...] but expected [8,2,8,2,...]). Unknown why some rows copy patterns without transformation.
 * Train2: Similar thinning issue—generated row3 [1,4,1,1,4,1,...] with singles/interruptions, but expected [1,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7,...] with full 4-run blocks; mappings seem ignored or partial (no 7s appear in generated); repeats pattern across row groups without vertical consolidation.
 * Overall: Frame and bg work well, but legend mapping and inner transformation fail to produce blocky/filled structures; no handling for multi-row pattern alignment or run merging vertically.
 * Function get_mappings is broken (arbitrary sorting/reversal doesn't capture pair intent, e.g., first color maps to second?); transform_row is incorrect/not relevant (outlining doesn't match block preservation—don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it applies the same flawed thinning to all inner rows, resulting in sparse singles like [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,...] and [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,2,4,...] with presumed bg=4 filling gaps, but expected likely has filled blocks similar to trainings (e.g., groups of 6,6,6 or 9,9,9,9 based on input runs, with correct mappings from legend pairs like (6,2)? (9,1)? (7,2)? applied to create solid sections in upper/lower parts).
 * Differences: Upper inner rows (e.g., generated row3 [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,4,4,4,9,4,5]) show interrupted singles (6 then 4s then 9), but expected would consolidate input's vertical 6/9 columns into blocks (e.g., 6,6,6 or similar); middle rows have no filling (e.g., row9 [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,2,4,4,4,2,4,1,...] scatters 2/1 without grouping); lower rows (e.g., row15 [4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,7,4,2,...]) thin 7/2 to singles, but expected probably fills like 7,7,7 or 2,2,2,2. No vertical pattern recognition, leading to repetitive but non-blocky output; mappings likely wrong (e.g., if legend pairs 6->something, it doesn't apply visibly). To handle test, need block-preserving transform and accurate pair-to-mapping logic (e.g., direct from-to without sorting).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the input grid contains borders and patterns marked by the number 5 (likely representing empty or framing space), with inner regions consisting of colored blocks (integers like 2,4,8 representing colors or objects). The goal is to extract and transform the inner content into a framed output grid, where borders are solidified with 5's, background is identified and filled appropriately, and patterned or scattered inner colors are consolidated into solid blocks of mapped or equivalent colors, preserving the overall shape and structure of the design while simplifying noisy or alternating patterns into clean, grouped regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 5 as a special border/empty marker; top and bottom borders are rows with a majority of 5's, and left/right borders are defined by overlapping runs of 5's in those border rows—subtlety: if no majority-5 rows exist, default to first and last rows, but this may not always apply if borders are partial.
 * Inner content (between borders, excluding side 5's) needs to be processed row-by-row: copy solid runs of 5 or background directly, but transform runs of other colors into solid blocks rather than alternating patterns; easy to miss that "mappings" should replace entire runs with a single target color (not alternate with background), based on adjacent color pairs in pre-border areas.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the strict inner area (rows top+1 to bottom-1, columns left+1 to right-1); subtlety: if no inner area exists, default to 0, but ensure it doesn't override borders or mapped blocks.
 * Mappings are derived from the top section (rows 0 to top inclusive): look for consecutive runs of >=2 identical non-5 colors before hitting a 5, and map the first color to the second if they differ; key subtlety: mappings are directional (color A adjacent to B maps A->B), skip single-cell runs, and stop at 5's— this may create incomplete dicts if patterns don't align perfectly, and unmapped colors should default to themselves.
 * Output framing: always create a subgrid sized to (bottom-top+1) x (right-left+1), with full 5 rows at top/bottom, full 5 columns on sides for inner rows, and fill inners by processing input rows top+1 to bottom-1, slicing columns left+1 to right, then applying background or mappings to runs without alternation.
 * Subtle elements: patterns in input may have noise like single interspersed cells or partial blocks that need consolidation (e.g., scattered 2's become solid 2-block); preserve row-specific variations without assuming uniform height for objects; handle cases where inner rows have varying run lengths or interruptions by background.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): ensure left/right overlap correctly from top/bottom 5-runs to avoid over-narrowing the frame; don't fill with alternating mapped/background as this creates striped noise instead of solid shapes; consider that expected outputs show vertical alignment of blocks across rows, suggesting object extraction or shape preservation beyond simple row-wise run processing.
 * General considerations: grids may have asymmetric patterns (e.g., train 2 has irregular block sizes), so avoid assuming symmetry; 5's inside inners should be treated as empty/background separators, not borders; test for edge cases like no mappings (fallback to original colors) or dominant background overwhelming counts.

(Note: The build_output function from the attempt is unhelpful/broken as-is, since it alternates mapped colors with background instead of filling solid blocks—do not reuse without fixing the inner fill loop to set entire run to mappings.get(val, val) without %2 alternation. No types like classes were used, but Tuple/Dict from typing are helpful for return types.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0 and 14 in train1/test, matching expected full-5 rows) and left/right via 5-run overlaps, producing framed outputs with correct dimensions and side 5-columns.
 * What worked: Border framing is solid (full 5's on top/bottom/sides), background detection seems accurate (e.g., 8 as bg in train1, 1 in train2, 4 in test), and mappings extraction partially works (identifies some color pairs like potentially 2->4 or similar, but application fails).
 * What didn't work: Inner filling alternates mapped color with background (e.g., 8,2,8,2... instead of solid 2,2,2), creating striped noise rather than consolidated blocks— this mismatches expected solid runs (e.g., train1 row3 generated has single 2's/4's separated by 8's, but expected has [2,2,2] and [4,4,4]; unknown why alternation was chosen, but it's clearly wrong).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated rows 2-4/6-8/10-12 show alternating patterns (e.g., row2: 8,2,8,2,8,4... ) vs expected grouped blocks (e.g., row3: 8,2,2,2,8,4,4,4...); rows 4/8/12 in generated are identical to row2 but expected varies (e.g., row4 has 2,2,2 and 8,8,4,8,8); lower section (rows10-12) alternates 8,2,8,2... vs expected solid 2,2,2 and 4,4,4.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated keeps single interspersed colors (e.g., row2: 1,4,1,4,1... with 1 as bg?) vs expected solid blocks (e.g., row2: 1,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7...); all inner rows in generated repeat the scattered pattern without grouping, missing vertical block alignment.
 * Test output generated with similar issues: Borders correct (full 5's top/bottom, sides), but inners alternate 4 (bg?) with singles like 2/6/7 (e.g., row2: 4,4,... but then 4,2,4,2... vs likely expected solid 2's; row8: 4,2,4,2... vs expected blocks; row14: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's)—this does not look correct, as it preserves input noise (scattered 2's/6's/7's) instead of consolidating into shapes, making the output look fragmented rather than a clean puzzle design.
 * extract_mappings is helpful but underutilizes (only pairs adjacent runs, may miss multi-step mappings); _find_run is useful for borders but only grabs longest—could extend to all 5-runs for better overlap.
 * build_output is broken (alternation logic creates wrong patterns) and not helpful—avoid reusing; no object extraction function present, but one might be needed to group vertical shapes across rows for block consolidation.
 * Overall, attempt shows border/background understanding but fails core transformation (solid vs alternating), leading to all incorrect outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it frames properly with 5's but fills inners with alternating 4 (likely bg) and singletons (2,6,7), e.g., row2/3/4/5/6: repeating 4,2,4,2... which scatters the pattern instead of grouping into solid vertical/horizontal blocks of 2's (as hinted by input's repeating 2 positions).
 * Missing consolidation: e.g., rows8-12 show 4,2,4,2... and 4,6,4,6... but expected likely has solid runs like three 2's or 6's together, similar to train1/2 where scattered inputs become blocks; row14-18: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's.
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: output looks noisy and untransformed, preserving input's interspersed singles rather than simplifying to clean shapes—probably needs vertical-aware block filling or better mapping application to entire runs without alternation.
 * To handle test: Update inner fill to set full run length to mapped color (solid), and consider scanning multiple rows for object shapes if patterns span heights.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a framed grid where the top section acts as a color mapping legend, the middle contains stacked patterns of objects on a background, and the goal is to transform the inner content by applying mappings to object colors while rendering multi-row objects with outlines (perimeter only, filled with background inside) rather than solid fills, ultimately outputting a new grid with the frame preserved.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame is always color 5, spanning top and bottom rows fully, with left/right edges in the inner content; detect top/bottom as rows with majority 5's, falling back to first/last if none.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the inner area (excluding frame edges); it's used to fill non-object spaces and insides of outlined objects.
 * Mappings are derived from the top legend rows (above the main content): they pair consecutive runs of distinct non-5/non-bg colors (run length >=2) where one color "points to" or precedes another, creating a dict like {source_color: target_color}.
 * Inner content consists of stacked horizontal runs of identical rows forming "objects" or full-bg rows; full-bg stacks should output as solid bg rows, and separate pattern stacks with a bg separator if followed by another pattern.
 * For each pattern stack of height h: if h==1, render full solid runs using mapped colors (bg runs stay bg); if h>1, render only the perimeter outline of the object using mapped colors (top/bottom/full rows outlined, sides implied by stacking), with interior filled as bg—subtle: outlines apply to the entire stack's shape, not just the first row, and single-cell runs in outlines should be preserved as mapped color without expansion.
 * Objects don't overlap or interact; process stacks independently, but ensure left/right frame (5's) are added to each output row.
 * Subtle: mappings are directional (from left run to right run in legend) and only for adjacent distinct colors with run len>=2; ignore bg/5 in mapping extraction.
 * Easy to miss: for multi-row objects, the "outline" means hollowing the interior (bg fill) across all rows except edges, but generated code only hollows the top row partially (using a minimal mask of just ends), leading to solid fills below.
 * Stacks must detect exact row equality for grouping; insert bg separators only between pattern stacks, not after full-bg or at ends.
 * Width of inner content is frame-constrained (left+1 to right-1); output width matches input frame width.
 * Colors are integers 1-9 typically; no rotation or symmetry assumed.

```

```python
def get_outline_mask(l: int) -> List[bool]:
    # Attempts to mask for outlines (True for edges, False for interior bg fill). Helpful concept but broken: only masks ends for any l>2, doesn't create full perimeter (e.g., for l=5, should be [T,T,F,T,T] or similar for top/bottom rows, but code does [T,F,F,F,T]).
    if l <= 2:
        return [True] * l
    mask = [False] * l
    mask[0] = True
    mask[l - 1] = True
    return mask
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects top/bottom frames, left/right edges, and background color in both training examples (bg=8 for ex1, bg=1 for ex2), preserving the 5-frame in output.
 * Stack detection for row groups works partially: it groups identical rows correctly and inserts bg separators between patterns, but treats full-bg stacks as single rows instead of height h.
 * Mapping extraction is incomplete/inaccurate: in ex1, it likely maps some colors (e.g., 2->something, 4->something) but applies them wrongly, leading to solid fills; in ex2, mappings like 4->7? are not applied correctly, resulting in unchanged or mismatched patterns.
 * Outlining logic fails core subtlety: for h>1 stacks, it only applies a minimal end-mask to the first row (k==0), then fills subsequent rows solidly with mapped color, ignoring interior bg fill—e.g., in ex1 row4, generates solid 4,4,4 and 2,2,2 instead of expected 8,4,8 (bg, mapped, bg) and similar hollow patterns.
 * In ex1, mismatches in rows 4,8,12 (0-indexed inner): generated has solid blocks like 2,2,2 / 4,4,4 where expected has interspersed bg (8) for hollowing, e.g., expected row4 has 8,4,8 instead of 4,4,4; row8 has 8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,8 vs generated solid; unknown why but likely due to no full-stack outlining.
 * In ex2, mismatches in rows 2-5,8-11 (inner): generated fills solidly like 4,4,4,4 / 7,7,7,7 / 8,8,8,8 where expected has irregular hollows/juts like 4,4,4,4 but then 7,7,1,1,1 / 7,7,7,7 / 8,1,1,8,1—suggests failed mapping application and no proper hollowing; e.g., row3 expected has 1's interrupting 7's, but generated ignores.
 * Function find_left_right is helpful but simplistic: finds overlapping 5-runs in top/bottom rows for frame width, works for these cases but may fail if no 5's in top/bottom inner.
 * Function to build stacks (grouping identical inner rows) is useful and mostly correct, but output_inner generation buggy: doesn't hollow full stack, applies mapping only to non-bg, and is_outline only for top row.
 * extract_mappings is partially helpful (catches some pairs) but broken for complex legends (e.g., skips valid pairs if followed by bg, doesn't overwrite mappings if multiple).
 * get_outline_mask is unhelpful/broken: too minimal (only edges, no interior True for sides in multi-row), doesn't differentiate top/side/bottom; don't use as-is, needs full perimeter logic per row type (top: full outline, middle: side only, bottom: full).
 * Overall, program understands frame/bg/stack structure (what worked) but fails object transformation (mappings + hollow outlining = what didn't), leading to solid blobs instead of hollow shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates solid filled objects (e.g., rows 3-6: full 9,9,9,9,9 and 2,2,2,2,2 blocks; rows 9-12: full 9's and 1,1,1,1,1 / 6,6,6,6,6; rows 15-18: full 7's and 1's) with no hollowing or interior bg (likely 4), and patterns don't match expected irregularity—e.g., upper object should probably have hollow 9's like 4,9,4 or similar based on training, but it's solid; lower parts similar. Mismatches suggest same issues as training: no full-stack outlining, possible wrong mappings (e.g., 9->? , 2->1? , etc.), and no juts/interruptions with bg. To handle test, need to apply mappings correctly (test legend likely maps 9->2? or similar, but output uses unmapped), and implement true hollowing for h>1 (e.g., middle rows: mapped on sides, bg inside).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions/connections** between elements. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, position via bbox, holes, pixels) that show clear, direct effects or transformations from input to output, present in **EVERY** train example (both Train 1 and Train 2). I ignored irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the outermost large background with low holes=2 or 3, which is consistently absent in outputs and has no apparent interaction). I also excluded inconsistent or unclear connections (e.g., small shape color mappings vary—Green/Blue to Yellow/Red in Train 1 vs. Pink/Dark Red to Maroon/Yellow/Dark Red in Train 2—so no consistent color transformation is identifiable). Only interactions that hold across both trains are included. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained (e.g., exact pixel change mechanism), it is noted as unknown but the connection is still listed if the pattern is consistent.

#### 1. **Orange Rectangular Frame (holes=1) Position Transformation**
   - **Components Involved**: Orange shape with holes=1, large pixels (58–64), acting as a 1-thick border/frame (per description: rectangular frames enclosing grid sections).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The bbox position is consistently shifted to start at [0, 0], while preserving the exact width (maxx - minx) and height (maxy - miny) from the input. Pixels remain unchanged.
     - Train 1: Input bbox=[3,8,21,22] (width=18, height=14, pixels=64) → Output bbox=[0,0,18,14] (same width/height, pixels=64).
     - Train 2: Input bbox=[5,8,22,20] (width=17, height=12, pixels=58) → Output bbox=[0,0,17,12] (same width/height, pixels=58).
   - **Consistency**: Direct position → position effect; frame acts as a "container" that anchors other elements (see below). No holes or pixels change.

#### 2. **Inner Holed Background (high holes=6–10) Position and Pixel Adjustment Relative to Orange Frame**
   - **Components Involved**: Inner shape (Maroon in Train 1, Blue in Train 2) with high holes (6 or 10), medium-large pixels (80–131), positioned inside the Orange frame (per description: background fills or panels with symmetric clusters, overlaid on frames).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The bbox is shifted to start at [1, 1] (inset by 1 unit from the transformed Orange frame's [0, 0]), preserving the exact input width and height to fit as an inner border. Holes remain unchanged. Pixels consistently increase by exactly +20 (unknown mechanism—possibly filling border gaps or adding consistent area, but not explainable from data alone).
     - Train 1: Input bbox=[4,9,20,21] (width=16, height=12, holes=10, pixels=131), inside Orange [3,8,21,22] → Output bbox=[1,1,17,13] (same width/height, holes=10, pixels=151 = +20).
     - Train 2: Input bbox=[6,9,21,19] (width=15, height=10, holes=6, pixels=80), inside Orange [5,8,22,20] → Output bbox=[1,1,16,11] (same width/height, holes=6, pixels=100 = +20).
   - **Consistency**: Position of inner background is dependent on Orange frame's transformation (frame position → inner position). Forms a nested structure (Orange frame encloses/adjusts the holed background). Large outer background (low holes) has no interaction and is removed.

#### 3. **Small Polyomino-like Shapes (holes=0, low pixels=5–16) Placement into Grid-like Positions Within Transformed Frame**
   - **Components Involved**: Small shapes (e.g., L-shaped, U-shaped, T/Y-like polyominoes or tiles in colors like Green/Blue/Red/Pink/Dark Red/Yellow/Maroon, holes=0, pixels=5–16; per description: colored square tiles, L/U/T polyominoes in grid arrangements).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Select small shapes from input (not all; only specific ones with consistent low pixels and holes=0) are repositioned into structured, grid-aligned bboxes (width/height=2–4 units) inside the transformed Orange frame. Their pixels and holes=0 are preserved or slightly adjusted (e.g., +1–2 pixels in some cases, unknown why). Positions form consistent row-like patterns (e.g., at relative y-levels like 2–5, 6–10, 10–12 within the new frame), but exact selection rule (e.g., which input shapes) is unknown and varies by color/bbox. No consistent color change across trains.
     - Train 1: Input small shapes (e.g., Green/Blue/Red/Yellow at various positions, pixels=5–9) → Output small shapes (Yellow/Red, pixels=6–8) placed at grid positions like [2,2,4,4], [6,2,8,4], [10,2,12,4], [14,2,16,4], [2,6,4,8], etc., all within new frame [0,0,18,14].
     - Train 2: Input small shapes (e.g., Green/Red/Pink/Dark Red/Yellow/Maroon, pixels=5–16) → Output small shapes (Maroon/Yellow/Dark Red, pixels=12–14) placed at grid positions like [2,2,5,5], [7,2,10,5], [12,2,15,5], [2,7,5,10], etc., all within new frame [0,0,17,12].
   - **Consistency**: Small shapes' positions are affected by the Orange frame's transformation (frame bounds → small shape placement inside). They interact via containment (placed within frame/inner background). Only holes=0 small shapes are involved; no high-hole shapes among them. Irrelevant small shapes (e.g., scattered external ones not fitting grid) are omitted.

No other connections (e.g., hole count → color, specific shape silhouettes → transformation) are consistent across both trains—many small shape details (e.g., exact rotations, colors) vary without clear effects. The overall structure shows a "containment hierarchy": small polyominoes → inner holed background → Orange frame, with positions propagating from frame adjustments. For the test input, these patterns could apply, but no further speculation is made as per instructions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 16:16:38] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid transformation, where an input grid with colored cells (numbers representing colors) and a border color (5) needs to be processed to produce an output grid that applies symmetry, pattern completion, or color substitutions to inner shapes, likely forming recognizable figures or symmetric designs within the bordered area. The goal is to identify structural elements like borders and background, then transform inner rows based on inferred rules from the top, but the current approach over-simplifies mappings and fails to replicate detailed patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The border is consistently marked by 5's, forming top/bottom rows and left/right edges; top/bottom detection should prioritize rows with majority 5's, but fallback to full span if none qualify.
 * Inner content involves shapes or blobs of colors (e.g., 1-9) separated by 5's or background; transformations seem to require pattern replication or substitution based on adjacency in top rows, but only for runs longer than 1 to avoid noise.
 * Background color is the most frequent non-5 in the core inner area (excluding borders), used to ignore filler in mappings and transformations.
 * Mappings are extracted only from rows above the main content (up to top border), looking for adjacent color runs (>=2 length) where one color "maps" to the next non-border/background color, suggesting a substitution rule like color A becomes B in certain contexts.
 * Transformations apply mappings to inner rows (sliced to content width), but preserve borders (5's) and background; however, this must handle varying pattern complexities, like alternating singles vs. solid blocks, without over-filling.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show non-uniform patterns (e.g., interspersed singles like 2-8-2 or partial fills), indicating the rule isn't simple substitution but possibly symmetry mirroring, hole filling, or conditional replacement based on position/context—easy to miss if assuming uniform block replacement.
 * Grids have consistent width but variable height; output always frames inner content with full 5 borders top/bottom/left/right.
 * Colors are 1-9 plus 5 (border); no 0 or >9 observed, but background can be any non-5.
 * Puzzle likely tests understanding of "objects" as color blobs; extraction should consider run lengths and adjacency, not just counts.
 * Edge cases: Empty inner areas default to background; mappings may not cover all colors (unmapped stay original); transformations ignore borders/background in input slices.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def find_top_bottom(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Identifies top/bottom border rows based on majority 5's; fallback to 0 and len(g)-1.

        for j in range(left + 1, right):
            val = g[i][j]

    if not count:
        return 0
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `extract_mappings`: Attempts to build dict of color -> next_color from top rows, but overly restrictive (requires >=2 run lengths, skips if next is border/bg, only checks forward adjacency); results in empty or incomplete mappings, leading to no transformations—just copying input patterns. Broken for cases needing bidirectional or contextual mapping; do not reuse without major fixes.
 * `transform_row`: Applies mappings but falls back to original if no map, preserving input exactly; ignores position-specific rules (e.g., symmetry). Not helpful as-is, since it doesn't generate expected interspersed patterns; avoid until mapping logic is corrected.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies borders (top/bottom via majority 5's, left/right via longest 5 runs in borders) and background (most common inner non-5), as seen in consistent 5 framing and apparent bg=8/1/4 in outputs.
 * Worked: Border addition/framing in all outputs matches expected (full 5 top/bottom, 5 left/right on inners); slicing inner rows to content width preserves dimensions.
 * Did not work: No effective color transformations applied, resulting in near-direct copies of input patterns (e.g., solid blocks of 2's/4's instead of expected alternations like 2-8-2 or partial fills); mappings likely empty due to flawed extraction (e.g., in train1, top rows may lack qualifying adjacent runs).
 * Train1: Generated solid horizontal blocks (e.g., row2: all 8's; row3: 8-2,2,2-8-4,4,4-... ) vs. expected dotted/alternating (e.g., row3: 8-2-8-2-8-4-8-4-8-... ) and asymmetric fills (e.g., row5 expected has 8-2,2,2-8-8,4-8-... but generated uniform); differences suggest missing rule for inserting 8's (bg?) between singles or mirroring.
 * Train2: Generated uniform repeats (e.g., row3-6: identical 1-4,4,4,4-1-7,7,7,7-... ) vs. expected progressive "erosion" or patterning (e.g., row4: 1-4,4,4,4-1-7,7-1,1,1-1-8,8,8-1,1-5? wait, expected row4: 1-4,4,4,4-1-7,7-1,1,1,1-8,8,8,8-1-5, but sliced); mismatches in later rows (e.g., row10 expected: 1-8-1,1-8-1-4-1-4,4-1-7,7-1,1,1-5 but generated solid); unknown why, possibly no mappings triggered.
 * Overall: Approach assumes simple forward substitution from top, but puzzle likely involves symmetry (e.g., mirroring left/right or top/bottom patterns), conditional fills based on adjacency, or "growing/shrinking" blobs—easy to miss without visualizing as shapes (e.g., letters with holes).
 * extract_mappings is essential in concept for rules but currently broken (empty dicts lead to identity transform); do not use without expanding to check all adjacencies or bidirectional.
 * No object extraction function present, but implied need: helpful for identifying blobs (runs/groups of same color) to apply per-blob rules like filling holes or symmetrizing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces large solid blocks (e.g., rows 3-7: solid 9's then solid 2's separated by 4's; rows 10-14: solid 9's-1's-6's; rows 16-20: solid 7's-1's) with uniform fills, framed by 5's and side 4's (likely bg=4), but lacks the interspersed or asymmetric patterns seen in training expecteds (e.g., no singles like 9-4-9 or partial blocks).
 * Differences: Expected likely mirrors training with dotted lines (e.g., alternating 9-4-9 for "edges") or evolving shapes (e.g., row15 might have 4-7-4-1-4 patterns), but generated copies input solids without transformation; bottom section (rows 16-20) over-fills 7's/1's uniformly vs. probable expected fragmentation (e.g., inserting 4's between).
 * Does not make sense as correct: Uniform blocks ignore subtle rules like adjacency-based insertion of bg (4) to create outlines/shapes; test has more colors (1,2,6,7,9 vs. train's fewer), suggesting need for per-color handling, but output treats them as solid—mismatch indicates failed mappings, similar to trains.
 * To handle test: Account for multi-section inners (e.g., upper 9/2, middle 1/6, lower 7/1) with separate transformations per "layer" or global mappings from all top-adjacent; ensure runs of 1 don't get skipped.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections between elements are obvious and consistent across **every** example (i.e., present and behaving identically in both Train 1 and Train 2). Only elements with clear, direct interactions (e.g., nesting, position-based transformations, or property adjustments that affect each other) are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., the input outer border with low holes=2 or 3, which disappears without transformation; isolated small top-row components with pixels=5-7, which do not consistently map to outputs) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., small polyomino-like components, whose colors, pixel counts, and positions vary in transformation rules—sometimes preserved, sometimes adjusted by -1 or -3 pixels, sometimes reordered without clear pattern) are noted as unknown where interactions cannot be explained. No high-level puzzle solution or forced connections are inferred; unknown aspects are explicitly called out.

1. **Orange component (holes=1) and multi-hole inner component (holes>=6, color=Maroon or Blue) - Nesting and relative positioning interaction**:
   - In inputs: The Orange component (holes=1, pixels≈58-64, border-like rectangular bbox) directly encloses the multi-hole inner component, with the inner positioned exactly inset by 1 unit (inner minx = Orange minx +1, inner miny = Orange miny +1, inner maxx = Orange maxx -1, inner maxy = Orange maxy -1). This nesting is preserved in structure but adjusted in the output.
   - In outputs: The Orange bbox is transformed by shifting to start at [0,0] while preserving width (maxx = original Orange width -1) and height (maxy = original Orange height -1); pixels and holes=1 remain unchanged; color preserved. The multi-hole inner bbox is then nested inside the new Orange position with the same inset-by-1 rule (inner minx=1, miny=1, maxx = new Orange maxx -1, maxy = new Orange maxy -1), preserving its own width, height, holes, and color.
   - Effect: The Orange's position transformation directly determines the multi-hole inner's new position (always inset by 1 relative to Orange). This interaction is consistent and explains the frames' relative movement without external factors.

2. **Multi-hole inner component (holes>=6, color=Maroon or Blue) - Pixel count adjustment**:
   - In inputs: Pixels vary (≈80-131), with no change.
   - In outputs: Pixels consistently increase by exactly +20 (e.g., 131 → 151; 80 → 100), independent of other properties like bbox size or color. This adjustment occurs after the position shift (interaction #1) and does not affect the Orange or other elements.
   - Effect: This is a self-transformation triggered by the overall frame repositioning, but its exact trigger (e.g., why +20 specifically) is unknown—no consistent link to other properties like holes or input position explains the fixed increment.

3. **Small polyomino-like components (various colors, small bbox 3-4 units, pixels=6-16) - Placement relative to Orange frame**:
   - In inputs: These are scattered (e.g., grid-like arrangements of Green/Blue/Red/etc. with pixels=5-16), sometimes adjacent or overlapping with the Orange/multi-hole frames but without consistent color-to-position effects.
   - In outputs: These are repositioned inside the new Orange frame (e.g., shifted leftward to fill from x≈2, y≈2 in rows), forming partial grids or clusters (e.g., alternating pixel counts like 6/8 or 12/14).
   - Effect/Interaction: Their new positions are constrained by the Orange's transformed bbox (placed within its bounds, often starting near [2,2] relative to Orange [0,0]), indicating the Orange frame affects their containment and layout. However, specific transformations (e.g., color changes like Green→Yellow or Blue→Red; pixel adjustments like 9→8 or preservation of 14; reordering rules) are unknown and inconsistent—no single property (e.g., input color → output color, position → pixel change, holes=0 → shape) explains behavior across both trains.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable. For example:
- Hole counts do not consistently affect color or movement (e.g., holes=0 small shapes transform variably; holes=1 Orange is fixed but not linked to small shapes).
- Colors do not have consistent effects (e.g., Green/Blue in inputs map to Yellow/Red variably; no position → color rule holds).
- The input outer border (holes=2-3, large bbox, pixels≈200+) encloses everything but has no consistent transformation or effect on outputs (disappears entirely; unknown why).

[2025-10-01 16:19:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a bordered grid (framed by 5s) that contains a "key" or legend in the upper section defining color mappings (e.g., one color replacing another based on adjacent runs), with the lower section being the main image to transform by applying those mappings, detecting background colors, and preserving or adjusting internal patterns without over-filling solid blocks. The output should retain sparse, patterned structures (like alternating colors or gaps) in the transformed image, rather than solidifying runs into uniform blocks.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is always framed by 5s on all sides, with top/bottom borders as full rows of 5s; identify these to crop the working area, but ensure the output includes the full frame.
 * The "key" is in the top rows (above the main image), consisting of adjacent runs of colors (at least length 2) that imply mappings (e.g., color A next to color B maps A to B); only use the first valid pair per row, and stop at 5s, but avoid mapping across the entire row if patterns are interrupted.
 * Background detection should look inside the frame (excluding borders) for uniform rows or areas of a single non-5 color to set as bg, but only in the main image section (not key); default to 0 if none, but in examples, bg seems to be a filler like 8 or 1 that gets preserved or replaced selectively.
 * Transformations apply mappings to non-bg, non-5 cells, but crucially, do not fill entire runs solidly—preserve original sparse patterns (e.g., alternating colors like 2-8-2 or gaps with 1s); over-filling into blocks is a common error, as seen in outputs.
 * Subtle: Mappings are directional (e.g., left run maps to right run) and only for distinct colors; ignore short runs (<2) or same-color adjacencies; key may span multiple rows, but mappings should be consolidated without duplicates.
 * Main image may have repeated block-like structures (e.g., horizontal bars of colors), but expected outputs introduce gaps, singles, or alternations (e.g., inserting 1s or 8s to break solids), suggesting a rule for "decoding" or outlining shapes rather than direct replacement.
 * Edge cases: If no candidates for top/bottom, default to full grid; inner areas may not be uniform for bg; test inputs have asymmetric sections (e.g., 9s only on right), so mappings must handle partial coverage without assuming symmetry.
 * 5s are always preserved as borders or dividers; non-5 colors (1-9) represent objects or fills, but transformations can "reveal" hidden patterns by replacing or removing based on key.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes pattern preservation over simplification—expected outputs look like stylized letters or icons with gaps, while generated ones look like filled pixel art.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (full 5 rows) and left/right (5 frames), as outputs preserve the 5 borders accurately in both trainings.
 * Mappings extraction partially works (e.g., seems to map some colors like 2->something, but incorrectly applies them by filling runs solidly instead of preserving gaps/alternations).
 * Background detection fails or is misapplied: In training 1, bg=8 is used but over-fills 8 areas; in training 2, bg=1 is preserved but doesn't insert gaps correctly.
 * Build_output over-simplifies transformations: In training 1, generates solid [2,2,2] and [4,4,4] blocks where expected has [2,8,2] alternations and [4,8,4]; difference is unknown but likely due to not decoding patterns via key (e.g., key implies alternating with bg).
 * In training 2, generates full [4,4,4,4] where expected has broken [4,1,4] or [7,1,1,1]; this mismatches blob shapes for unknown reason (possibly key defines gap-insertion rules missed by extract_mappings).
 * find_left_right is buggy/not fully helpful: Relies only on top row's longest 5-run, which works for symmetric frames but may fail asymmetric test inputs.
 * extract_mappings is partially helpful but broken for multi-pair keys: Only grabs first pair per row and breaks early, leading to incomplete dicts (e.g., misses 4->7, 8->something in training 2).
 * Overall attempt shows basic frame detection but fails core transformation, resulting in INCORRECT for both trainings; no object extraction function present, which might be needed for pattern preservation (e.g., connected components to detect shapes before mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It generates large solid blocks (e.g., full rows of 4s, 9s on right, 2s/6s in middle, 8s/2s at bottom) within the 5 frame, but expected likely has sparse patterns with gaps or alternations (similar to trainings, e.g., breaking 9s with 4s or inserting bg like 4 between 2s/6s), as solid fills ignore key-based decoding.
 * Specifically, upper section has unbroken [9,9,9,9,9] where expected might alternate 9 with bg=4; middle has solid [2,2,2,2,2] and [6,6,6,6,6] likely needing gaps like [2,4,2]; bottom [8,8,8,8,8] to [2,2,2,2,2] should pattern like [8,2,8] or similar.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it repeats the over-filling error from trainings—test input's asymmetry (9s only right, 2s/6s/8s in sections) suggests mappings like 9->something sparse, but output treats as solid objects without transformation subtlety.
 * To handle test, account for vertical/horizontal partial keys and pattern-breaking rules (e.g., replace based on adjacency, not whole runs).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-9, with 5 as a special frame/border color) that represents a framed artwork or pattern; the goal is to extract and transform the internal content into a stylized output with a consistent 5-border frame on all sides, while remapping and restructuring internal colors/patterns based on a "legend" or pairing rules derived from the area above the frame, preserving blocky or run-based structures rather than thinning them.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a frame defined by runs of 5s: top and bottom rows are mostly or fully 5s, left and right edges within the frame are 5s, creating a bounded inner area.
 * Background color (bg) is the most common non-5 color inside the frame (excluding borders); it's used to fill spaces but not treated as a mappable color.
 * A "legend" area above the top frame row contains pairs of colored runs (sequences of >=2 identical non-5, non-bg cells) that imply color mappings (e.g., from one color to another), but mappings must be derived carefully—simple sorting or reversing doesn't always work, and the number of pairs (e.g., 2) may trigger special handling like reversal, but this seems inconsistent.
 * Internal transformation: Runs of mapped colors inside the frame should be preserved as solid blocks or partially filled, not thinned to outlines; for example, a run of 3+ same color becomes a block of that mapped color, but subtleties include handling varying run lengths, interruptions by bg or 5, and ensuring symmetry or pattern mirroring across rows/sections.
 * Output structure: Always starts/ends with full-5 rows; inner output rows (top+1 to bottom-1) are prefixed/suffixed with 5s, and the inner content is sliced from left+1 to right-1 of input, then transformed (no direct copying).
 * Subtle elements: Pairs in legend must be adjacent runs of different colors, both >=2 length, skipping bg/5; mappings apply only to non-bg/5 colors with runs >=2 in inner area—single cells may stay unmapped or be treated as bg. Patterns often have vertical alignment or repetition across row groups (e.g., 3-row blocks), and expected outputs show filled runs (e.g., 2,2,2) where input might have scattered or partial fills. Frame detection must handle partial 5-runs (e.g., > half row is 5). No modification to frame itself. Handle empty/edge cases (empty grid returns empty).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) correctly detects frame bounds (top/bottom via majority 5s, left/right via max 5-run overlap) and bg color in both trainings and test.
 * Extract_pairs identifies legend pairs, but get_mappings derives incorrect substitutions (e.g., in train1, likely maps 2->4 and 4->2 wrongly, leading to swapped positions; in train2, mappings like 4->7?, but generated shows no filling).
 * Transform_row thins all inner runs >=2 to outlines (e.g., for a run of 3: color,bg,color), but expected preserves solid blocks (e.g., train1 row2 expected [8,2,8,2,...] but generated [8,4,8,4,...] with singles; train1 row3 expected [8,2,2,2,8,4,4,4,...] but generated repeats single [8,4,8,4,...] across rows without filling).
 * Train1: Generated mismatches in inner patterns—e.g., row3 has scattered singles like 4,8,2 but expected has grouped blocks like 2,2,2 and 4,4,4; lower sections (rows7-9) fill some 8s but still single 2/4; bottom legend application wrong (e.g., row11 generated [8,4,8,4,...] but expected [8,2,8,2,...]). Unknown why some rows copy patterns without transformation.
 * Train2: Similar thinning issue—generated row3 [1,4,1,1,4,1,...] with singles/interruptions, but expected [1,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7,...] with full 4-run blocks; mappings seem ignored or partial (no 7s appear in generated); repeats pattern across row groups without vertical consolidation.
 * Overall: Frame and bg work well, but legend mapping and inner transformation fail to produce blocky/filled structures; no handling for multi-row pattern alignment or run merging vertically.
 * Function get_mappings is broken (arbitrary sorting/reversal doesn't capture pair intent, e.g., first color maps to second?); transform_row is incorrect/not relevant (outlining doesn't match block preservation—don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it applies the same flawed thinning to all inner rows, resulting in sparse singles like [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,...] and [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,2,4,...] with presumed bg=4 filling gaps, but expected likely has filled blocks similar to trainings (e.g., groups of 6,6,6 or 9,9,9,9 based on input runs, with correct mappings from legend pairs like (6,2)? (9,1)? (7,2)? applied to create solid sections in upper/lower parts).
 * Differences: Upper inner rows (e.g., generated row3 [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,4,4,4,9,4,5]) show interrupted singles (6 then 4s then 9), but expected would consolidate input's vertical 6/9 columns into blocks (e.g., 6,6,6 or similar); middle rows have no filling (e.g., row9 [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,2,4,4,4,2,4,1,...] scatters 2/1 without grouping); lower rows (e.g., row15 [4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,7,4,2,...]) thin 7/2 to singles, but expected probably fills like 7,7,7 or 2,2,2,2. No vertical pattern recognition, leading to repetitive but non-blocky output; mappings likely wrong (e.g., if legend pairs 6->something, it doesn't apply visibly). To handle test, need block-preserving transform and accurate pair-to-mapping logic (e.g., direct from-to without sorting).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid transformation, where an input grid with colored cells (numbers representing colors) and a border color (5) needs to be processed to produce an output grid that applies symmetry, pattern completion, or color substitutions to inner shapes, likely forming recognizable figures or symmetric designs within the bordered area. The goal is to identify structural elements like borders and background, then transform inner rows based on inferred rules from the top, but the current approach over-simplifies mappings and fails to replicate detailed patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The border is consistently marked by 5's, forming top/bottom rows and left/right edges; top/bottom detection should prioritize rows with majority 5's, but fallback to full span if none qualify.
 * Inner content involves shapes or blobs of colors (e.g., 1-9) separated by 5's or background; transformations seem to require pattern replication or substitution based on adjacency in top rows, but only for runs longer than 1 to avoid noise.
 * Background color is the most frequent non-5 in the core inner area (excluding borders), used to ignore filler in mappings and transformations.
 * Mappings are extracted only from rows above the main content (up to top border), looking for adjacent color runs (>=2 length) where one color "maps" to the next non-border/background color, suggesting a substitution rule like color A becomes B in certain contexts.
 * Transformations apply mappings to inner rows (sliced to content width), but preserve borders (5's) and background; however, this must handle varying pattern complexities, like alternating singles vs. solid blocks, without over-filling.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show non-uniform patterns (e.g., interspersed singles like 2-8-2 or partial fills), indicating the rule isn't simple substitution but possibly symmetry mirroring, hole filling, or conditional replacement based on position/context—easy to miss if assuming uniform block replacement.
 * Grids have consistent width but variable height; output always frames inner content with full 5 borders top/bottom/left/right.
 * Colors are 1-9 plus 5 (border); no 0 or >9 observed, but background can be any non-5.
 * Puzzle likely tests understanding of "objects" as color blobs; extraction should consider run lengths and adjacency, not just counts.
 * Edge cases: Empty inner areas default to background; mappings may not cover all colors (unmapped stay original); transformations ignore borders/background in input slices.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `extract_mappings`: Attempts to build dict of color -> next_color from top rows, but overly restrictive (requires >=2 run lengths, skips if next is border/bg, only checks forward adjacency); results in empty or incomplete mappings, leading to no transformations—just copying input patterns. Broken for cases needing bidirectional or contextual mapping; do not reuse without major fixes.
 * `transform_row`: Applies mappings but falls back to original if no map, preserving input exactly; ignores position-specific rules (e.g., symmetry). Not helpful as-is, since it doesn't generate expected interspersed patterns; avoid until mapping logic is corrected.

 * This single attempt correctly identifies borders (top/bottom via majority 5's, left/right via longest 5 runs in borders) and background (most common inner non-5), as seen in consistent 5 framing and apparent bg=8/1/4 in outputs.
 * Worked: Border addition/framing in all outputs matches expected (full 5 top/bottom, 5 left/right on inners); slicing inner rows to content width preserves dimensions.
 * Did not work: No effective color transformations applied, resulting in near-direct copies of input patterns (e.g., solid blocks of 2's/4's instead of expected alternations like 2-8-2 or partial fills); mappings likely empty due to flawed extraction (e.g., in train1, top rows may lack qualifying adjacent runs).
 * Train1: Generated solid horizontal blocks (e.g., row2: all 8's; row3: 8-2,2,2-8-4,4,4-... ) vs. expected dotted/alternating (e.g., row3: 8-2-8-2-8-4-8-4-8-... ) and asymmetric fills (e.g., row5 expected has 8-2,2,2-8-8,4-8-... but generated uniform); differences suggest missing rule for inserting 8's (bg?) between singles or mirroring.
 * Train2: Generated uniform repeats (e.g., row3-6: identical 1-4,4,4,4-1-7,7,7,7-... ) vs. expected progressive "erosion" or patterning (e.g., row4: 1-4,4,4,4-1-7,7-1,1,1-1-8,8,8-1,1-5? wait, expected row4: 1-4,4,4,4-1-7,7-1,1,1,1-8,8,8,8-1-5, but sliced); mismatches in later rows (e.g., row10 expected: 1-8-1,1-8-1-4-1-4,4-1-7,7-1,1,1-5 but generated solid); unknown why, possibly no mappings triggered.
 * Overall: Approach assumes simple forward substitution from top, but puzzle likely involves symmetry (e.g., mirroring left/right or top/bottom patterns), conditional fills based on adjacency, or "growing/shrinking" blobs—easy to miss without visualizing as shapes (e.g., letters with holes).
 * extract_mappings is essential in concept for rules but currently broken (empty dicts lead to identity transform); do not use without expanding to check all adjacencies or bidirectional.
 * No object extraction function present, but implied need: helpful for identifying blobs (runs/groups of same color) to apply per-blob rules like filling holes or symmetrizing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces large solid blocks (e.g., rows 3-7: solid 9's then solid 2's separated by 4's; rows 10-14: solid 9's-1's-6's; rows 16-20: solid 7's-1's) with uniform fills, framed by 5's and side 4's (likely bg=4), but lacks the interspersed or asymmetric patterns seen in training expecteds (e.g., no singles like 9-4-9 or partial blocks).
 * Differences: Expected likely mirrors training with dotted lines (e.g., alternating 9-4-9 for "edges") or evolving shapes (e.g., row15 might have 4-7-4-1-4 patterns), but generated copies input solids without transformation; bottom section (rows 16-20) over-fills 7's/1's uniformly vs. probable expected fragmentation (e.g., inserting 4's between).
 * Does not make sense as correct: Uniform blocks ignore subtle rules like adjacency-based insertion of bg (4) to create outlines/shapes; test has more colors (1,2,6,7,9 vs. train's fewer), suggesting need for per-color handling, but output treats them as solid—mismatch indicates failed mappings, similar to trains.
 * To handle test: Account for multi-section inners (e.g., upper 9/2, middle 1/6, lower 7/1) with separate transformations per "layer" or global mappings from all top-adjacent; ensure runs of 1 don't get skipped.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the input grid contains borders and patterns marked by the number 5 (likely representing empty or framing space), with inner regions consisting of colored blocks (integers like 2,4,8 representing colors or objects). The goal is to extract and transform the inner content into a framed output grid, where borders are solidified with 5's, background is identified and filled appropriately, and patterned or scattered inner colors are consolidated into solid blocks of mapped or equivalent colors, preserving the overall shape and structure of the design while simplifying noisy or alternating patterns into clean, grouped regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses 5 as a special border/empty marker; top and bottom borders are rows with a majority of 5's, and left/right borders are defined by overlapping runs of 5's in those border rows—subtlety: if no majority-5 rows exist, default to first and last rows, but this may not always apply if borders are partial.
 * Inner content (between borders, excluding side 5's) needs to be processed row-by-row: copy solid runs of 5 or background directly, but transform runs of other colors into solid blocks rather than alternating patterns; easy to miss that "mappings" should replace entire runs with a single target color (not alternate with background), based on adjacent color pairs in pre-border areas.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the strict inner area (rows top+1 to bottom-1, columns left+1 to right-1); subtlety: if no inner area exists, default to 0, but ensure it doesn't override borders or mapped blocks.
 * Mappings are derived from the top section (rows 0 to top inclusive): look for consecutive runs of >=2 identical non-5 colors before hitting a 5, and map the first color to the second if they differ; key subtlety: mappings are directional (color A adjacent to B maps A->B), skip single-cell runs, and stop at 5's— this may create incomplete dicts if patterns don't align perfectly, and unmapped colors should default to themselves.
 * Output framing: always create a subgrid sized to (bottom-top+1) x (right-left+1), with full 5 rows at top/bottom, full 5 columns on sides for inner rows, and fill inners by processing input rows top+1 to bottom-1, slicing columns left+1 to right, then applying background or mappings to runs without alternation.
 * Subtle elements: patterns in input may have noise like single interspersed cells or partial blocks that need consolidation (e.g., scattered 2's become solid 2-block); preserve row-specific variations without assuming uniform height for objects; handle cases where inner rows have varying run lengths or interruptions by background.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): ensure left/right overlap correctly from top/bottom 5-runs to avoid over-narrowing the frame; don't fill with alternating mapped/background as this creates striped noise instead of solid shapes; consider that expected outputs show vertical alignment of blocks across rows, suggesting object extraction or shape preservation beyond simple row-wise run processing.
 * General considerations: grids may have asymmetric patterns (e.g., train 2 has irregular block sizes), so avoid assuming symmetry; 5's inside inners should be treated as empty/background separators, not borders; test for edge cases like no mappings (fallback to original colors) or dominant background overwhelming counts.

(Note: The build_output function from the attempt is unhelpful/broken as-is, since it alternates mapped colors with background instead of filling solid blocks—do not reuse without fixing the inner fill loop to set entire run to mappings.get(val, val) without %2 alternation. No types like classes were used, but Tuple/Dict from typing are helpful for return types.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0 and 14 in train1/test, matching expected full-5 rows) and left/right via 5-run overlaps, producing framed outputs with correct dimensions and side 5-columns.
 * What worked: Border framing is solid (full 5's on top/bottom/sides), background detection seems accurate (e.g., 8 as bg in train1, 1 in train2, 4 in test), and mappings extraction partially works (identifies some color pairs like potentially 2->4 or similar, but application fails).
 * What didn't work: Inner filling alternates mapped color with background (e.g., 8,2,8,2... instead of solid 2,2,2), creating striped noise rather than consolidated blocks— this mismatches expected solid runs (e.g., train1 row3 generated has single 2's/4's separated by 8's, but expected has [2,2,2] and [4,4,4]; unknown why alternation was chosen, but it's clearly wrong).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated rows 2-4/6-8/10-12 show alternating patterns (e.g., row2: 8,2,8,2,8,4... ) vs expected grouped blocks (e.g., row3: 8,2,2,2,8,4,4,4...); rows 4/8/12 in generated are identical to row2 but expected varies (e.g., row4 has 2,2,2 and 8,8,4,8,8); lower section (rows10-12) alternates 8,2,8,2... vs expected solid 2,2,2 and 4,4,4.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated keeps single interspersed colors (e.g., row2: 1,4,1,4,1... with 1 as bg?) vs expected solid blocks (e.g., row2: 1,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7...); all inner rows in generated repeat the scattered pattern without grouping, missing vertical block alignment.
 * Test output generated with similar issues: Borders correct (full 5's top/bottom, sides), but inners alternate 4 (bg?) with singles like 2/6/7 (e.g., row2: 4,4,... but then 4,2,4,2... vs likely expected solid 2's; row8: 4,2,4,2... vs expected blocks; row14: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's)—this does not look correct, as it preserves input noise (scattered 2's/6's/7's) instead of consolidating into shapes, making the output look fragmented rather than a clean puzzle design.
 * extract_mappings is helpful but underutilizes (only pairs adjacent runs, may miss multi-step mappings); _find_run is useful for borders but only grabs longest—could extend to all 5-runs for better overlap.
 * build_output is broken (alternation logic creates wrong patterns) and not helpful—avoid reusing; no object extraction function present, but one might be needed to group vertical shapes across rows for block consolidation.
 * Overall, attempt shows border/background understanding but fails core transformation (solid vs alternating), leading to all incorrect outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it frames properly with 5's but fills inners with alternating 4 (likely bg) and singletons (2,6,7), e.g., row2/3/4/5/6: repeating 4,2,4,2... which scatters the pattern instead of grouping into solid vertical/horizontal blocks of 2's (as hinted by input's repeating 2 positions).
 * Missing consolidation: e.g., rows8-12 show 4,2,4,2... and 4,6,4,6... but expected likely has solid runs like three 2's or 6's together, similar to train1/2 where scattered inputs become blocks; row14-18: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's.
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: output looks noisy and untransformed, preserving input's interspersed singles rather than simplifying to clean shapes—probably needs vertical-aware block filling or better mapping application to entire runs without alternation.
 * To handle test: Update inner fill to set full run length to mapped color (solid), and consider scanning multiple rows for object shapes if patterns span heights.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a framed grid where the top section acts as a color mapping legend, the middle contains stacked patterns of objects on a background, and the goal is to transform the inner content by applying mappings to object colors while rendering multi-row objects with outlines (perimeter only, filled with background inside) rather than solid fills, ultimately outputting a new grid with the frame preserved.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame is always color 5, spanning top and bottom rows fully, with left/right edges in the inner content; detect top/bottom as rows with majority 5's, falling back to first/last if none.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the inner area (excluding frame edges); it's used to fill non-object spaces and insides of outlined objects.
 * Mappings are derived from the top legend rows (above the main content): they pair consecutive runs of distinct non-5/non-bg colors (run length >=2) where one color "points to" or precedes another, creating a dict like {source_color: target_color}.
 * Inner content consists of stacked horizontal runs of identical rows forming "objects" or full-bg rows; full-bg stacks should output as solid bg rows, and separate pattern stacks with a bg separator if followed by another pattern.
 * For each pattern stack of height h: if h==1, render full solid runs using mapped colors (bg runs stay bg); if h>1, render only the perimeter outline of the object using mapped colors (top/bottom/full rows outlined, sides implied by stacking), with interior filled as bg—subtle: outlines apply to the entire stack's shape, not just the first row, and single-cell runs in outlines should be preserved as mapped color without expansion.
 * Objects don't overlap or interact; process stacks independently, but ensure left/right frame (5's) are added to each output row.
 * Subtle: mappings are directional (from left run to right run in legend) and only for adjacent distinct colors with run len>=2; ignore bg/5 in mapping extraction.
 * Easy to miss: for multi-row objects, the "outline" means hollowing the interior (bg fill) across all rows except edges, but generated code only hollows the top row partially (using a minimal mask of just ends), leading to solid fills below.
 * Stacks must detect exact row equality for grouping; insert bg separators only between pattern stacks, not after full-bg or at ends.
 * Width of inner content is frame-constrained (left+1 to right-1); output width matches input frame width.
 * Colors are integers 1-9 typically; no rotation or symmetry assumed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects top/bottom frames, left/right edges, and background color in both training examples (bg=8 for ex1, bg=1 for ex2), preserving the 5-frame in output.
 * Stack detection for row groups works partially: it groups identical rows correctly and inserts bg separators between patterns, but treats full-bg stacks as single rows instead of height h.
 * Mapping extraction is incomplete/inaccurate: in ex1, it likely maps some colors (e.g., 2->something, 4->something) but applies them wrongly, leading to solid fills; in ex2, mappings like 4->7? are not applied correctly, resulting in unchanged or mismatched patterns.
 * Outlining logic fails core subtlety: for h>1 stacks, it only applies a minimal end-mask to the first row (k==0), then fills subsequent rows solidly with mapped color, ignoring interior bg fill—e.g., in ex1 row4, generates solid 4,4,4 and 2,2,2 instead of expected 8,4,8 (bg, mapped, bg) and similar hollow patterns.
 * In ex1, mismatches in rows 4,8,12 (0-indexed inner): generated has solid blocks like 2,2,2 / 4,4,4 where expected has interspersed bg (8) for hollowing, e.g., expected row4 has 8,4,8 instead of 4,4,4; row8 has 8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,8 vs generated solid; unknown why but likely due to no full-stack outlining.
 * In ex2, mismatches in rows 2-5,8-11 (inner): generated fills solidly like 4,4,4,4 / 7,7,7,7 / 8,8,8,8 where expected has irregular hollows/juts like 4,4,4,4 but then 7,7,1,1,1 / 7,7,7,7 / 8,1,1,8,1—suggests failed mapping application and no proper hollowing; e.g., row3 expected has 1's interrupting 7's, but generated ignores.
 * Function find_left_right is helpful but simplistic: finds overlapping 5-runs in top/bottom rows for frame width, works for these cases but may fail if no 5's in top/bottom inner.
 * Function to build stacks (grouping identical inner rows) is useful and mostly correct, but output_inner generation buggy: doesn't hollow full stack, applies mapping only to non-bg, and is_outline only for top row.
 * extract_mappings is partially helpful (catches some pairs) but broken for complex legends (e.g., skips valid pairs if followed by bg, doesn't overwrite mappings if multiple).
 * get_outline_mask is unhelpful/broken: too minimal (only edges, no interior True for sides in multi-row), doesn't differentiate top/side/bottom; don't use as-is, needs full perimeter logic per row type (top: full outline, middle: side only, bottom: full).
 * Overall, program understands frame/bg/stack structure (what worked) but fails object transformation (mappings + hollow outlining = what didn't), leading to solid blobs instead of hollow shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates solid filled objects (e.g., rows 3-6: full 9,9,9,9,9 and 2,2,2,2,2 blocks; rows 9-12: full 9's and 1,1,1,1,1 / 6,6,6,6,6; rows 15-18: full 7's and 1's) with no hollowing or interior bg (likely 4), and patterns don't match expected irregularity—e.g., upper object should probably have hollow 9's like 4,9,4 or similar based on training, but it's solid; lower parts similar. Mismatches suggest same issues as training: no full-stack outlining, possible wrong mappings (e.g., 9->? , 2->1? , etc.), and no juts/interruptions with bg. To handle test, need to apply mappings correctly (test legend likely maps 9->2? or similar, but output uses unmapped), and implement true hollowing for h>1 (e.g., middle rows: mapped on sides, bg inside).

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections between elements are obvious and consistent across **every** example (i.e., present and behaving identically in both Train 1 and Train 2). Only elements with clear, direct interactions (e.g., nesting, position-based transformations, or property adjustments that affect each other) are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., the input outer border with low holes=2 or 3, which disappears without transformation; isolated small top-row components with pixels=5-7, which do not consistently map to outputs) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., small polyomino-like components, whose colors, pixel counts, and positions vary in transformation rules—sometimes preserved, sometimes adjusted by -1 or -3 pixels, sometimes reordered without clear pattern) are noted as unknown where interactions cannot be explained. No high-level puzzle solution or forced connections are inferred; unknown aspects are explicitly called out.

1. **Orange component (holes=1) and multi-hole inner component (holes>=6, color=Maroon or Blue) - Nesting and relative positioning interaction**:
   - In inputs: The Orange component (holes=1, pixels≈58-64, border-like rectangular bbox) directly encloses the multi-hole inner component, with the inner positioned exactly inset by 1 unit (inner minx = Orange minx +1, inner miny = Orange miny +1, inner maxx = Orange maxx -1, inner maxy = Orange maxy -1). This nesting is preserved in structure but adjusted in the output.
   - In outputs: The Orange bbox is transformed by shifting to start at [0,0] while preserving width (maxx = original Orange width -1) and height (maxy = original Orange height -1); pixels and holes=1 remain unchanged; color preserved. The multi-hole inner bbox is then nested inside the new Orange position with the same inset-by-1 rule (inner minx=1, miny=1, maxx = new Orange maxx -1, maxy = new Orange maxy -1), preserving its own width, height, holes, and color.
   - Effect: The Orange's position transformation directly determines the multi-hole inner's new position (always inset by 1 relative to Orange). This interaction is consistent and explains the frames' relative movement without external factors.

2. **Multi-hole inner component (holes>=6, color=Maroon or Blue) - Pixel count adjustment**:
   - In inputs: Pixels vary (≈80-131), with no change.
   - In outputs: Pixels consistently increase by exactly +20 (e.g., 131 → 151; 80 → 100), independent of other properties like bbox size or color. This adjustment occurs after the position shift (interaction #1) and does not affect the Orange or other elements.
   - Effect: This is a self-transformation triggered by the overall frame repositioning, but its exact trigger (e.g., why +20 specifically) is unknown—no consistent link to other properties like holes or input position explains the fixed increment.

3. **Small polyomino-like components (various colors, small bbox 3-4 units, pixels=6-16) - Placement relative to Orange frame**:
   - In inputs: These are scattered (e.g., grid-like arrangements of Green/Blue/Red/etc. with pixels=5-16), sometimes adjacent or overlapping with the Orange/multi-hole frames but without consistent color-to-position effects.
   - In outputs: These are repositioned inside the new Orange frame (e.g., shifted leftward to fill from x≈2, y≈2 in rows), forming partial grids or clusters (e.g., alternating pixel counts like 6/8 or 12/14).
   - Effect/Interaction: Their new positions are constrained by the Orange's transformed bbox (placed within its bounds, often starting near [2,2] relative to Orange [0,0]), indicating the Orange frame affects their containment and layout. However, specific transformations (e.g., color changes like Green→Yellow or Blue→Red; pixel adjustments like 9→8 or preservation of 14; reordering rules) are unknown and inconsistent—no single property (e.g., input color → output color, position → pixel change, holes=0 → shape) explains behavior across both trains.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable. For example:
- Hole counts do not consistently affect color or movement (e.g., holes=0 small shapes transform variably; holes=1 Orange is fixed but not linked to small shapes).
- Colors do not have consistent effects (e.g., Green/Blue in inputs map to Yellow/Red variably; no position → color rule holds).
- The input outer border (holes=2-3, large bbox, pixels≈200+) encloses everything but has no consistent transformation or effect on outputs (disappears entirely; unknown why).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 16:31:21] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns where borders are marked by 5's, and inner regions consist of colored blocks (numbers 1-9 representing colors) arranged in stacked, repeating rows that form shapes or objects. The goal is to transform the input grid by detecting a background color, deriving color mappings from the top section, grouping inner rows into vertical stacks of identical patterns, applying mappings to colors, and then "thinning" the top and bottom rows of each stack by reducing long runs of mapped colors to single instances separated by background, while leaving middle rows unchanged and preserving all-5 or all-background stacks.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders are always full rows/columns of 5's at top and bottom; left/right borders are inferred from the longest horizontal runs of 5's in those rows, but must overlap vertically for the inner region.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the strict inner area (excluding borders); if no inner area or uniform 5's, default to 0, but this seems unused effectively.
 * Color mappings are extracted only from the top section (rows 0 to top inclusive? but code uses top+1), looking for adjacent runs of non-5/non-bg colors with length >=2; only the first such pair per row is used, and mappings are one-way (color -> next_color), applied by substitution.
 * Inner region is sliced excluding left/right borders; rows are grouped into "stacks" of consecutive identical rows, tracking height and if all-bg.
 * For transformation: Map all inner colors using the dict (bg stays bg); for non-all-bg stacks, top/bottom rows of the stack get "thinned" (long runs >2 become v-bg*(l-2)-v, short <=2 stay as-is, bg runs unchanged); middle rows stay fully mapped; all-bg stacks output plain bg rows.
 * Subtlety: Thinning only applies to the first and last row of each stack, not per individual row, to simulate "eroding" stack edges while preserving internal structure; this misses cases where stacks have varying patterns or mappings don't apply uniformly.
 * Stacks must be exact row matches for grouping; partial overlaps or non-repeating rows break this.
 * Output rebuilds full grid with 5 borders, inserting transformed inner rows starting from output row 1 to height-2.
 * Easy to miss: Mappings are sparse (only first pair per top row, and code breaks after first pair overall?), so not all colors map; unmapped colors stay original. Also, thinning doesn't handle vertical alignment or interactions between stacks.
 * Inner width is right-left-1, but slicing uses left+1:right, which excludes borders correctly but assumes uniform width.
 * No handling for multiple mappings per row or chaining; code skips 5/bg runs but may over-skip.
 * Puzzle assumes rectangular inner, no diagonals or irregular shapes; all patterns are axis-aligned blocks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders via majority-5 rows and left/right via overlapping max 5-runs, which works for uniform-bordered examples.
 * Background detection via most-common non-5 in inner works in principle but isn't applied effectively since mappings often don't cover all colors.
 * Stack grouping by consecutive identical inner rows is a good insight for handling repeated patterns vertically, and distinguishing all-bg stacks avoids unnecessary processing.
 * Mapping extraction from top rows captures some substitutions (e.g., seems to map in example 1, but output suggests incomplete application like 2->8? wait, no clear mapping shown).
 * Thinning via build_thinned on stack top/bottom rows correctly erodes long runs to edges+bg fill, preserving short ones, which aligns with "outline" effect in expected.
 * What didn't work: In training 1, upper stack (rows 2-4) thinned row 4 incorrectly—generated full [2,2,2] and [4,4,4] blocks instead of expected thinned [2,2,2] but with middle row having 8's interrupting (expected row4: 2,2,2 then 8,4,8 etc., but gen has no interruption); lower similar mismatches, e.g., row8 expected thinned with 8's but gen has full 2,2,2 without. Suggests thinning applied wrong row or mapping missing (e.g., 4 not mapped?).
 * In training 1, bottom stack (rows 10-12) gen row12 as full 2,2,2 and 4,4,4 without thinning interruptions like expected 2,2,2 then 8,4,8; indicates build_thinned not triggering or wrong mapped input.
 * Training 2 completely mismatches: gen replicates input patterns without proper thinning or mapping—e.g., row2 gen full 4,4,4 blocks but expected has interruptions like 7,7,1,1,1; row3 gen full but expected partial; suggests mappings not derived (top has no clear pairs?) or not applied to stacks.
 * extract_mappings is broken: overly skips and breaks early (only one pair total?), missing multi-color tops; in ex2 top row2 has 4-1? but code may skip to bg=1? (bg likely 1 from inners).
 * build_thinned is helpful but unhelpful when applied to wrong rows (e.g., all rows in stack instead of just edges) or if mapped_row has bg interruptions already (code treats per-run, but may over-thin).
 * Overall, program understands stacking and thinning concept but fails on mapping completeness, stack row selection (applies thinning to every row in some cases?), and inner slicing (ex1 row4 gen has 8's but wrong positions vs expected interruptions).
 * No object extraction function present, but stack grouping acts as basic "object" segmentation vertically; could extend to horizontal for full shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it largely replicates the input patterns with minimal transformation—e.g., upper stack (rows 2-6) has full 9,9,9 blocks in rows 3-5 without thinning or interruptions, but based on training patterns, expected thinning on top/bottom of stack (rows 2 and 6) to 9-bg-9 or similar, and mapping from top (possibly 9->something from row2 patterns).
 * Middle stack (rows 8-12) gen full 9's and 2/6 blocks without edge thinning; expected likely thins row8 and12 to outlines, e.g., single 9's separated by bg=4.
 * Lower stack (rows 14-18) similar issue: full 8/2 blocks in rows 15-17, but row14/18 should thin to edges; also, no visible mapping applied (e.g., if top maps 9->2 or similar, but output unchanged).
 * All-bg rows (e.g., row7,13,19) correctly output as 4's (bg), but overall lacks the "eroded stack edges" seen in expected training (e.g., training1 has interruptions like 8's in thinned rows).
 * Test has wider grid (21 cols) with more complex multi-stack (upper 9's, middle 9+2+6, lower 8+2), so misses vertical interactions; output makes sense as a naive copy+partial-map but not as puzzle solution, since training shows need for per-stack edge modification to create outlined/shrunk shapes.
 * Without expected test, infer from training: output should have more bg interruptions in stack edges, possibly remapped colors (e.g., 9->4? but bg=4, unlikely); current gen ignores stack heights >3, applying uniform no-thinning.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 16:31:28] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and properties extracted from the provided examples (train inputs/outputs and test input). Only those with obvious, direct interactions or effects that are **consistent across EVERY example** (both train inputs/outputs and the test input) are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., individual small tile colors or positions that do not repeat consistently) are excluded. No high-level puzzle interpretation or full solution is attempted. Where a transformation or effect cannot be clearly explained as consistent and direct (e.g., exact pixel changes), it is noted as unknown rather than speculated.

#### Components Identified
- **Frame**: Orange-colored component with `holes=1`. Present in all inputs and both train outputs. Acts as a rectangular border/outline (pixels suggest sparse/thin structure relative to bbox size, e.g., 64 pixels for ~18x14 area in train 1).
- **Inner Background**: Large component (variable color: Maroon in train 1, Blue in train 2, Yellow in test) with high `holes` count (10 in train 1, 6 in train 2, 7 in test). Positioned within the frame's bbox. Fills space inside the frame (high pixels relative to bbox, e.g., 131-186 pixels for ~16x12 to 18x18 areas).
- **Outer Background**: Large component (variable color: Maroon in train 1, Blue in train 2, Yellow in test) with low `holes` count (2-3 in trains, 7 in test but still lower than inner relative to size). Encompasses the entire scene (largest bbox starting at or near [0,0]).
- **Small Tiles**: Scattered small components (various colors, all with `holes=0` and low pixels: 2-25). These are solid blocks/polyomino-like (no holes, irregular bboxes suggesting L/U shapes based on pixel counts and bbox ratios). Present in all inputs and rearranged in train outputs. Only general properties noted below, as specific color/position interactions vary and are not consistent across all.

Components like small Maroons or Blues with holes>0 in the test input are excluded, as they lack consistency (no holes>0 in small tiles across trains).

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are direct, observable links (e.g., one property affecting another's value or transformation) that hold in **every** input and (where applicable) train output. No forced or inconsistent links (e.g., small tile color -> position) are included.

1. **Frame Position -> Inner Background Position**:
   - The inner background's bbox is consistently positioned as an inset within the frame's bbox: inner_minx = frame_minx + 1, inner_miny = frame_miny + 1, inner_maxx = frame_maxx - 1, inner_maxy = frame_maxy - 1.
   - Consistent in: All inputs (train 1: frame [3,8,21,22] -> inner [4,9,20,21]; train 2: [5,8,22,20] -> [6,9,21,19]; test: [0,9,20,29] -> [1,10,19,28]).
   - In train outputs: This relationship is preserved after frame repositioning (frame moves to [0,0,frame_w,frame_h], inner adjusts to [1,1,frame_w-1,frame_h-1]; e.g., train 1 output: frame [0,0,18,14] -> inner [1,1,17,13]).
   - Effect: Frame bbox boundaries directly constrain and define the inner background's spatial extent (1-unit margin on all sides).

2. **Frame Dimensions -> Inner Background Dimensions**:
   - Inner background dimensions are consistently derived from frame: inner_width = frame_width - 2, inner_height = frame_height - 2.
   - Consistent in: All inputs (train 1: frame 18x14 -> inner 16x12; train 2: 17x12 -> 15x10; test: 20x20 -> 18x18).
   - In train outputs: Dimensions preserved (repositioned but unchanged; e.g., train 1 output inner remains 16x12).
   - Effect: Frame size directly determines inner size (subtract 2 units, matching the 1-unit inset on each side).

3. **Outer Background Position -> Frame and Inner Background Position**:
   - The frame and inner background are always fully contained within the outer background's bbox (outer_minx <= frame_minx, outer_miny <= frame_miny, etc.).
   - Consistent in: All inputs (e.g., train 1 outer [0,0,23,22] contains frame [3,8,21,22] and inner [4,9,20,21]; similar for train 2 and test).
   - In train outputs: Outer background is absent; frame and inner are repositioned independently (no longer contained in an outer).
   - Effect: In inputs, outer bbox acts as a container/encompasser for frame and inner positions. Transformation in outputs removes this containment (unknown reason for removal).

4. **Small Tiles Properties -> No Direct Consistent Interaction with Frame/Backgrounds**:
   - All small tiles consistently have `holes=0` (no variation or effect from other components).
   - Small tiles are positioned outside the inner background but inside the outer background in all inputs (no overlap with frame/inner bboxes).
   - In train outputs: Small tiles are repositioned inside the inner background's new bbox (e.g., output 1 tiles at [2,2,4,4], [6,2,8,4], etc., within inner [1,1,17,13]).
   - Effect: General spatial shift (outside inner -> inside inner), but specific positions, colors, or pixel changes vary (e.g., input pixels 5-9 -> output 6-8; colors like Green/Blue -> Red/Yellow in train 1, but Red/Pink -> Maroon/Yellow in train 2). No consistent property-based transformation identifiable (e.g., position -> color or pixels -> new position unknown).

5. **Inner Background Pixels -> Unknown Transformation in Outputs**:
   - In train outputs only: Inner pixels increase by exactly 20 (train 1: 131 -> 151; train 2: 80 -> 100). No test output to verify.
   - Consistent in: Both train input/output pairs.
   - Effect: Fixed additive change (+20 pixels), independent of input pixels, holes, or size. Reason unknown (no clear link to other properties like frame pixels=64/58 or small tile counts).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., hole count -> color, small tile adjacency -> transformation) are observable across all examples. Small tile colors and exact shapes (e.g., L/U based on pixels/bbox) do not show repeatable effects on other components.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 16:33:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a bordered grid (framed by 5s) that contains a "key" or legend in the upper section defining color mappings (e.g., one color replacing another based on adjacent runs), with the lower section being the main image to transform by applying those mappings, detecting background colors, and preserving or adjusting internal patterns without over-filling solid blocks. The output should retain sparse, patterned structures (like alternating colors or gaps) in the transformed image, rather than solidifying runs into uniform blocks.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is always framed by 5s on all sides, with top/bottom borders as full rows of 5s; identify these to crop the working area, but ensure the output includes the full frame.
 * The "key" is in the top rows (above the main image), consisting of adjacent runs of colors (at least length 2) that imply mappings (e.g., color A next to color B maps A to B); only use the first valid pair per row, and stop at 5s, but avoid mapping across the entire row if patterns are interrupted.
 * Background detection should look inside the frame (excluding borders) for uniform rows or areas of a single non-5 color to set as bg, but only in the main image section (not key); default to 0 if none, but in examples, bg seems to be a filler like 8 or 1 that gets preserved or replaced selectively.
 * Transformations apply mappings to non-bg, non-5 cells, but crucially, do not fill entire runs solidly—preserve original sparse patterns (e.g., alternating colors like 2-8-2 or gaps with 1s); over-filling into blocks is a common error, as seen in outputs.
 * Subtle: Mappings are directional (e.g., left run maps to right run) and only for distinct colors; ignore short runs (<2) or same-color adjacencies; key may span multiple rows, but mappings should be consolidated without duplicates.
 * Main image may have repeated block-like structures (e.g., horizontal bars of colors), but expected outputs introduce gaps, singles, or alternations (e.g., inserting 1s or 8s to break solids), suggesting a rule for "decoding" or outlining shapes rather than direct replacement.
 * Edge cases: If no candidates for top/bottom, default to full grid; inner areas may not be uniform for bg; test inputs have asymmetric sections (e.g., 9s only on right), so mappings must handle partial coverage without assuming symmetry.
 * 5s are always preserved as borders or dividers; non-5 colors (1-9) represent objects or fills, but transformations can "reveal" hidden patterns by replacing or removing based on key.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes pattern preservation over simplification—expected outputs look like stylized letters or icons with gaps, while generated ones look like filled pixel art.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

# Useful for identifying frame borders; works well if >half row is 5s, with fallback to full grid.
def find_top_bottom(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    row_len = len(g[0])
    candidates = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        count_5 = sum(1 for x in g[i] if x == 5)
        if count_5 > row_len // 2:
            candidates.append(i)
    if not candidates:
        return 0, len(g) - 1
    return min(candidates), max(candidates)
```

```python
# Partially helpful for finding horizontal 5-run borders in top row, but buggy (uses top row only, assumes longest 5-run defines left/right without checking full frame).
def find_left_right(g: List[List[int]], top: int, bottom: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    row = g[top]  # Issue: Only uses top row; should scan frame edges.
    n = len(row)
    max_len = 0
    curr_len = 0
    start = 0
    end = 0
    curr_start = 0
    for j in range(n + 1):
        if j < n and row[j] == 5:
            if curr_len == 0:
                curr_start = j
            curr_len += 1
            if curr_len > max_len:
                max_len = curr_len
                start = curr_start
                end = j
        else:
            curr_len = 0
    return start, end
```

```python
# Helpful for extracting mappings from key rows, but broken: Assumes only first pair per row, skips short runs, stops at 5s correctly, but over-simplifies by breaking after first mapping and not consolidating across rows; misses multi-pair keys.

    mappings: Dict[int, int] = {}

            color = row[j]
            run_start = j
            while j < n and row[j] == color:
                j += 1
            run_len = j - run_start
            if run_len < 2:
                continue
            if j >= n:
                break
            next_color = row[j]
            if next_color == 5:
                break
            next_start = j
            while j < n and row[j] == next_color:
                j += 1
            next_len = j - next_start
            if next_len < 2:
                continue
            if color != next_color:
                mappings[color] = next_color
                break  # Issue: Only first pair; should collect all valid pairs.
    return mappings
```

```python
# Somewhat helpful for bg detection in main image (uniform inner rows), but limited: Only checks rows top+1 to bottom-1, assumes full inner span uniform; misses partial or non-horizontal uniformity.
def find_background(g: List[List[int]], top: int, bottom: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
    inner_left = left + 1
    inner_right = right - 1

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (full 5 rows) and left/right (5 frames), as outputs preserve the 5 borders accurately in both trainings.
 * Mappings extraction partially works (e.g., seems to map some colors like 2->something, but incorrectly applies them by filling runs solidly instead of preserving gaps/alternations).
 * Background detection fails or is misapplied: In training 1, bg=8 is used but over-fills 8 areas; in training 2, bg=1 is preserved but doesn't insert gaps correctly.
 * Build_output over-simplifies transformations: In training 1, generates solid [2,2,2] and [4,4,4] blocks where expected has [2,8,2] alternations and [4,8,4]; difference is unknown but likely due to not decoding patterns via key (e.g., key implies alternating with bg).
 * In training 2, generates full [4,4,4,4] where expected has broken [4,1,4] or [7,1,1,1]; this mismatches blob shapes for unknown reason (possibly key defines gap-insertion rules missed by extract_mappings).
 * find_left_right is buggy/not fully helpful: Relies only on top row's longest 5-run, which works for symmetric frames but may fail asymmetric test inputs.
 * extract_mappings is partially helpful but broken for multi-pair keys: Only grabs first pair per row and breaks early, leading to incomplete dicts (e.g., misses 4->7, 8->something in training 2).
 * Overall attempt shows basic frame detection but fails core transformation, resulting in INCORRECT for both trainings; no object extraction function present, which might be needed for pattern preservation (e.g., connected components to detect shapes before mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It generates large solid blocks (e.g., full rows of 4s, 9s on right, 2s/6s in middle, 8s/2s at bottom) within the 5 frame, but expected likely has sparse patterns with gaps or alternations (similar to trainings, e.g., breaking 9s with 4s or inserting bg like 4 between 2s/6s), as solid fills ignore key-based decoding.
 * Specifically, upper section has unbroken [9,9,9,9,9] where expected might alternate 9 with bg=4; middle has solid [2,2,2,2,2] and [6,6,6,6,6] likely needing gaps like [2,4,2]; bottom [8,8,8,8,8] to [2,2,2,2,2] should pattern like [8,2,8] or similar.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it repeats the over-filling error from trainings—test input's asymmetry (9s only right, 2s/6s/8s in sections) suggests mappings like 9->something sparse, but output treats as solid objects without transformation subtlety.
 * To handle test, account for vertical/horizontal partial keys and pattern-breaking rules (e.g., replace based on adjacency, not whole runs).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-9, with 5 as a special frame/border color) that represents a framed artwork or pattern; the goal is to extract and transform the internal content into a stylized output with a consistent 5-border frame on all sides, while remapping and restructuring internal colors/patterns based on a "legend" or pairing rules derived from the area above the frame, preserving blocky or run-based structures rather than thinning them.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a frame defined by runs of 5s: top and bottom rows are mostly or fully 5s, left and right edges within the frame are 5s, creating a bounded inner area.
 * Background color (bg) is the most common non-5 color inside the frame (excluding borders); it's used to fill spaces but not treated as a mappable color.
 * A "legend" area above the top frame row contains pairs of colored runs (sequences of >=2 identical non-5, non-bg cells) that imply color mappings (e.g., from one color to another), but mappings must be derived carefully—simple sorting or reversing doesn't always work, and the number of pairs (e.g., 2) may trigger special handling like reversal, but this seems inconsistent.
 * Internal transformation: Runs of mapped colors inside the frame should be preserved as solid blocks or partially filled, not thinned to outlines; for example, a run of 3+ same color becomes a block of that mapped color, but subtleties include handling varying run lengths, interruptions by bg or 5, and ensuring symmetry or pattern mirroring across rows/sections.
 * Output structure: Always starts/ends with full-5 rows; inner output rows (top+1 to bottom-1) are prefixed/suffixed with 5s, and the inner content is sliced from left+1 to right-1 of input, then transformed (no direct copying).
 * Subtle elements: Pairs in legend must be adjacent runs of different colors, both >=2 length, skipping bg/5; mappings apply only to non-bg/5 colors with runs >=2 in inner area—single cells may stay unmapped or be treated as bg. Patterns often have vertical alignment or repetition across row groups (e.g., 3-row blocks), and expected outputs show filled runs (e.g., 2,2,2) where input might have scattered or partial fills. Frame detection must handle partial 5-runs (e.g., > half row is 5). No modification to frame itself. Handle empty/edge cases (empty grid returns empty).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) correctly detects frame bounds (top/bottom via majority 5s, left/right via max 5-run overlap) and bg color in both trainings and test.
 * Extract_pairs identifies legend pairs, but get_mappings derives incorrect substitutions (e.g., in train1, likely maps 2->4 and 4->2 wrongly, leading to swapped positions; in train2, mappings like 4->7?, but generated shows no filling).
 * Transform_row thins all inner runs >=2 to outlines (e.g., for a run of 3: color,bg,color), but expected preserves solid blocks (e.g., train1 row2 expected [8,2,8,2,...] but generated [8,4,8,4,...] with singles; train1 row3 expected [8,2,2,2,8,4,4,4,...] but generated repeats single [8,4,8,4,...] across rows without filling).
 * Train1: Generated mismatches in inner patterns—e.g., row3 has scattered singles like 4,8,2 but expected has grouped blocks like 2,2,2 and 4,4,4; lower sections (rows7-9) fill some 8s but still single 2/4; bottom legend application wrong (e.g., row11 generated [8,4,8,4,...] but expected [8,2,8,2,...]). Unknown why some rows copy patterns without transformation.
 * Train2: Similar thinning issue—generated row3 [1,4,1,1,4,1,...] with singles/interruptions, but expected [1,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7,...] with full 4-run blocks; mappings seem ignored or partial (no 7s appear in generated); repeats pattern across row groups without vertical consolidation.
 * Overall: Frame and bg work well, but legend mapping and inner transformation fail to produce blocky/filled structures; no handling for multi-row pattern alignment or run merging vertically.
 * Function get_mappings is broken (arbitrary sorting/reversal doesn't capture pair intent, e.g., first color maps to second?); transform_row is incorrect/not relevant (outlining doesn't match block preservation—don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it applies the same flawed thinning to all inner rows, resulting in sparse singles like [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,...] and [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,2,4,...] with presumed bg=4 filling gaps, but expected likely has filled blocks similar to trainings (e.g., groups of 6,6,6 or 9,9,9,9 based on input runs, with correct mappings from legend pairs like (6,2)? (9,1)? (7,2)? applied to create solid sections in upper/lower parts).
 * Differences: Upper inner rows (e.g., generated row3 [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,4,4,4,9,4,5]) show interrupted singles (6 then 4s then 9), but expected would consolidate input's vertical 6/9 columns into blocks (e.g., 6,6,6 or similar); middle rows have no filling (e.g., row9 [4,6,4,4,4,6,4,2,4,4,4,2,4,1,...] scatters 2/1 without grouping); lower rows (e.g., row15 [4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,7,4,2,...]) thin 7/2 to singles, but expected probably fills like 7,7,7 or 2,2,2,2. No vertical pattern recognition, leading to repetitive but non-blocky output; mappings likely wrong (e.g., if legend pairs 6->something, it doesn't apply visibly). To handle test, need block-preserving transform and accurate pair-to-mapping logic (e.g., direct from-to without sorting).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid transformation, where an input grid with colored cells (numbers representing colors) and a border color (5) needs to be processed to produce an output grid that applies symmetry, pattern completion, or color substitutions to inner shapes, likely forming recognizable figures or symmetric designs within the bordered area. The goal is to identify structural elements like borders and background, then transform inner rows based on inferred rules from the top, but the current approach over-simplifies mappings and fails to replicate detailed patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The border is consistently marked by 5's, forming top/bottom rows and left/right edges; top/bottom detection should prioritize rows with majority 5's, but fallback to full span if none qualify.
 * Inner content involves shapes or blobs of colors (e.g., 1-9) separated by 5's or background; transformations seem to require pattern replication or substitution based on adjacency in top rows, but only for runs longer than 1 to avoid noise.
 * Background color is the most frequent non-5 in the core inner area (excluding borders), used to ignore filler in mappings and transformations.
 * Mappings are extracted only from rows above the main content (up to top border), looking for adjacent color runs (>=2 length) where one color "maps" to the next non-border/background color, suggesting a substitution rule like color A becomes B in certain contexts.
 * Transformations apply mappings to inner rows (sliced to content width), but preserve borders (5's) and background; however, this must handle varying pattern complexities, like alternating singles vs. solid blocks, without over-filling.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show non-uniform patterns (e.g., interspersed singles like 2-8-2 or partial fills), indicating the rule isn't simple substitution but possibly symmetry mirroring, hole filling, or conditional replacement based on position/context—easy to miss if assuming uniform block replacement.
 * Grids have consistent width but variable height; output always frames inner content with full 5 borders top/bottom/left/right.
 * Colors are 1-9 plus 5 (border); no 0 or >9 observed, but background can be any non-5.
 * Puzzle likely tests understanding of "objects" as color blobs; extraction should consider run lengths and adjacency, not just counts.
 * Edge cases: Empty inner areas default to background; mappings may not cover all colors (unmapped stay original); transformations ignore borders/background in input slices.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * `extract_mappings`: Attempts to build dict of color -> next_color from top rows, but overly restrictive (requires >=2 run lengths, skips if next is border/bg, only checks forward adjacency); results in empty or incomplete mappings, leading to no transformations—just copying input patterns. Broken for cases needing bidirectional or contextual mapping; do not reuse without major fixes.
 * `transform_row`: Applies mappings but falls back to original if no map, preserving input exactly; ignores position-specific rules (e.g., symmetry). Not helpful as-is, since it doesn't generate expected interspersed patterns; avoid until mapping logic is corrected.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies borders (top/bottom via majority 5's, left/right via longest 5 runs in borders) and background (most common inner non-5), as seen in consistent 5 framing and apparent bg=8/1/4 in outputs.
 * Worked: Border addition/framing in all outputs matches expected (full 5 top/bottom, 5 left/right on inners); slicing inner rows to content width preserves dimensions.
 * Did not work: No effective color transformations applied, resulting in near-direct copies of input patterns (e.g., solid blocks of 2's/4's instead of expected alternations like 2-8-2 or partial fills); mappings likely empty due to flawed extraction (e.g., in train1, top rows may lack qualifying adjacent runs).
 * Train1: Generated solid horizontal blocks (e.g., row2: all 8's; row3: 8-2,2,2-8-4,4,4-... ) vs. expected dotted/alternating (e.g., row3: 8-2-8-2-8-4-8-4-8-... ) and asymmetric fills (e.g., row5 expected has 8-2,2,2-8-8,4-8-... but generated uniform); differences suggest missing rule for inserting 8's (bg?) between singles or mirroring.
 * Train2: Generated uniform repeats (e.g., row3-6: identical 1-4,4,4,4-1-7,7,7,7-... ) vs. expected progressive "erosion" or patterning (e.g., row4: 1-4,4,4,4-1-7,7-1,1,1-1-8,8,8-1,1-5? wait, expected row4: 1-4,4,4,4-1-7,7-1,1,1,1-8,8,8,8-1-5, but sliced); mismatches in later rows (e.g., row10 expected: 1-8-1,1-8-1-4-1-4,4-1-7,7-1,1,1-5 but generated solid); unknown why, possibly no mappings triggered.
 * Overall: Approach assumes simple forward substitution from top, but puzzle likely involves symmetry (e.g., mirroring left/right or top/bottom patterns), conditional fills based on adjacency, or "growing/shrinking" blobs—easy to miss without visualizing as shapes (e.g., letters with holes).
 * extract_mappings is essential in concept for rules but currently broken (empty dicts lead to identity transform); do not use without expanding to check all adjacencies or bidirectional.
 * No object extraction function present, but implied need: helpful for identifying blobs (runs/groups of same color) to apply per-blob rules like filling holes or symmetrizing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces large solid blocks (e.g., rows 3-7: solid 9's then solid 2's separated by 4's; rows 10-14: solid 9's-1's-6's; rows 16-20: solid 7's-1's) with uniform fills, framed by 5's and side 4's (likely bg=4), but lacks the interspersed or asymmetric patterns seen in training expecteds (e.g., no singles like 9-4-9 or partial blocks).
 * Differences: Expected likely mirrors training with dotted lines (e.g., alternating 9-4-9 for "edges") or evolving shapes (e.g., row15 might have 4-7-4-1-4 patterns), but generated copies input solids without transformation; bottom section (rows 16-20) over-fills 7's/1's uniformly vs. probable expected fragmentation (e.g., inserting 4's between).
 * Does not make sense as correct: Uniform blocks ignore subtle rules like adjacency-based insertion of bg (4) to create outlines/shapes; test has more colors (1,2,6,7,9 vs. train's fewer), suggesting need for per-color handling, but output treats them as solid—mismatch indicates failed mappings, similar to trains.
 * To handle test: Account for multi-section inners (e.g., upper 9/2, middle 1/6, lower 7/1) with separate transformations per "layer" or global mappings from all top-adjacent; ensure runs of 1 don't get skipped.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the input grid contains borders and patterns marked by the number 5 (likely representing empty or framing space), with inner regions consisting of colored blocks (integers like 2,4,8 representing colors or objects). The goal is to extract and transform the inner content into a framed output grid, where borders are solidified with 5's, background is identified and filled appropriately, and patterned or scattered inner colors are consolidated into solid blocks of mapped or equivalent colors, preserving the overall shape and structure of the design while simplifying noisy or alternating patterns into clean, grouped regions.

 * The grid uses 5 as a special border/empty marker; top and bottom borders are rows with a majority of 5's, and left/right borders are defined by overlapping runs of 5's in those border rows—subtlety: if no majority-5 rows exist, default to first and last rows, but this may not always apply if borders are partial.
 * Inner content (between borders, excluding side 5's) needs to be processed row-by-row: copy solid runs of 5 or background directly, but transform runs of other colors into solid blocks rather than alternating patterns; easy to miss that "mappings" should replace entire runs with a single target color (not alternate with background), based on adjacent color pairs in pre-border areas.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the strict inner area (rows top+1 to bottom-1, columns left+1 to right-1); subtlety: if no inner area exists, default to 0, but ensure it doesn't override borders or mapped blocks.
 * Mappings are derived from the top section (rows 0 to top inclusive): look for consecutive runs of >=2 identical non-5 colors before hitting a 5, and map the first color to the second if they differ; key subtlety: mappings are directional (color A adjacent to B maps A->B), skip single-cell runs, and stop at 5's— this may create incomplete dicts if patterns don't align perfectly, and unmapped colors should default to themselves.
 * Output framing: always create a subgrid sized to (bottom-top+1) x (right-left+1), with full 5 rows at top/bottom, full 5 columns on sides for inner rows, and fill inners by processing input rows top+1 to bottom-1, slicing columns left+1 to right, then applying background or mappings to runs without alternation.
 * Subtle elements: patterns in input may have noise like single interspersed cells or partial blocks that need consolidation (e.g., scattered 2's become solid 2-block); preserve row-specific variations without assuming uniform height for objects; handle cases where inner rows have varying run lengths or interruptions by background.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): ensure left/right overlap correctly from top/bottom 5-runs to avoid over-narrowing the frame; don't fill with alternating mapped/background as this creates striped noise instead of solid shapes; consider that expected outputs show vertical alignment of blocks across rows, suggesting object extraction or shape preservation beyond simple row-wise run processing.
 * General considerations: grids may have asymmetric patterns (e.g., train 2 has irregular block sizes), so avoid assuming symmetry; 5's inside inners should be treated as empty/background separators, not borders; test for edge cases like no mappings (fallback to original colors) or dominant background overwhelming counts.

(Note: The build_output function from the attempt is unhelpful/broken as-is, since it alternates mapped colors with background instead of filling solid blocks—do not reuse without fixing the inner fill loop to set entire run to mappings.get(val, val) without %2 alternation. No types like classes were used, but Tuple/Dict from typing are helpful for return types.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0 and 14 in train1/test, matching expected full-5 rows) and left/right via 5-run overlaps, producing framed outputs with correct dimensions and side 5-columns.
 * What worked: Border framing is solid (full 5's on top/bottom/sides), background detection seems accurate (e.g., 8 as bg in train1, 1 in train2, 4 in test), and mappings extraction partially works (identifies some color pairs like potentially 2->4 or similar, but application fails).
 * What didn't work: Inner filling alternates mapped color with background (e.g., 8,2,8,2... instead of solid 2,2,2), creating striped noise rather than consolidated blocks— this mismatches expected solid runs (e.g., train1 row3 generated has single 2's/4's separated by 8's, but expected has [2,2,2] and [4,4,4]; unknown why alternation was chosen, but it's clearly wrong).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated rows 2-4/6-8/10-12 show alternating patterns (e.g., row2: 8,2,8,2,8,4... ) vs expected grouped blocks (e.g., row3: 8,2,2,2,8,4,4,4...); rows 4/8/12 in generated are identical to row2 but expected varies (e.g., row4 has 2,2,2 and 8,8,4,8,8); lower section (rows10-12) alternates 8,2,8,2... vs expected solid 2,2,2 and 4,4,4.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated keeps single interspersed colors (e.g., row2: 1,4,1,4,1... with 1 as bg?) vs expected solid blocks (e.g., row2: 1,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7...); all inner rows in generated repeat the scattered pattern without grouping, missing vertical block alignment.
 * Test output generated with similar issues: Borders correct (full 5's top/bottom, sides), but inners alternate 4 (bg?) with singles like 2/6/7 (e.g., row2: 4,4,... but then 4,2,4,2... vs likely expected solid 2's; row8: 4,2,4,2... vs expected blocks; row14: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's)—this does not look correct, as it preserves input noise (scattered 2's/6's/7's) instead of consolidating into shapes, making the output look fragmented rather than a clean puzzle design.
 * extract_mappings is helpful but underutilizes (only pairs adjacent runs, may miss multi-step mappings); _find_run is useful for borders but only grabs longest—could extend to all 5-runs for better overlap.
 * build_output is broken (alternation logic creates wrong patterns) and not helpful—avoid reusing; no object extraction function present, but one might be needed to group vertical shapes across rows for block consolidation.
 * Overall, attempt shows border/background understanding but fails core transformation (solid vs alternating), leading to all incorrect outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it frames properly with 5's but fills inners with alternating 4 (likely bg) and singletons (2,6,7), e.g., row2/3/4/5/6: repeating 4,2,4,2... which scatters the pattern instead of grouping into solid vertical/horizontal blocks of 2's (as hinted by input's repeating 2 positions).
 * Missing consolidation: e.g., rows8-12 show 4,2,4,2... and 4,6,4,6... but expected likely has solid runs like three 2's or 6's together, similar to train1/2 where scattered inputs become blocks; row14-18: 4,7,4,7... vs expected solid 7's and 2's.
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: output looks noisy and untransformed, preserving input's interspersed singles rather than simplifying to clean shapes—probably needs vertical-aware block filling or better mapping application to entire runs without alternation.
 * To handle test: Update inner fill to set full run length to mapped color (solid), and consider scanning multiple rows for object shapes if patterns span heights.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a framed grid where the top section acts as a color mapping legend, the middle contains stacked patterns of objects on a background, and the goal is to transform the inner content by applying mappings to object colors while rendering multi-row objects with outlines (perimeter only, filled with background inside) rather than solid fills, ultimately outputting a new grid with the frame preserved.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame is always color 5, spanning top and bottom rows fully, with left/right edges in the inner content; detect top/bottom as rows with majority 5's, falling back to first/last if none.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the inner area (excluding frame edges); it's used to fill non-object spaces and insides of outlined objects.
 * Mappings are derived from the top legend rows (above the main content): they pair consecutive runs of distinct non-5/non-bg colors (run length >=2) where one color "points to" or precedes another, creating a dict like {source_color: target_color}.
 * Inner content consists of stacked horizontal runs of identical rows forming "objects" or full-bg rows; full-bg stacks should output as solid bg rows, and separate pattern stacks with a bg separator if followed by another pattern.
 * For each pattern stack of height h: if h==1, render full solid runs using mapped colors (bg runs stay bg); if h>1, render only the perimeter outline of the object using mapped colors (top/bottom/full rows outlined, sides implied by stacking), with interior filled as bg—subtle: outlines apply to the entire stack's shape, not just the first row, and single-cell runs in outlines should be preserved as mapped color without expansion.
 * Objects don't overlap or interact; process stacks independently, but ensure left/right frame (5's) are added to each output row.
 * Subtle: mappings are directional (from left run to right run in legend) and only for adjacent distinct colors with run len>=2; ignore bg/5 in mapping extraction.
 * Easy to miss: for multi-row objects, the "outline" means hollowing the interior (bg fill) across all rows except edges, but generated code only hollows the top row partially (using a minimal mask of just ends), leading to solid fills below.
 * Stacks must detect exact row equality for grouping; insert bg separators only between pattern stacks, not after full-bg or at ends.
 * Width of inner content is frame-constrained (left+1 to right-1); output width matches input frame width.
 * Colors are integers 1-9 typically; no rotation or symmetry assumed.

        return [True] * l
    mask = [False] * l

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects top/bottom frames, left/right edges, and background color in both training examples (bg=8 for ex1, bg=1 for ex2), preserving the 5-frame in output.
 * Stack detection for row groups works partially: it groups identical rows correctly and inserts bg separators between patterns, but treats full-bg stacks as single rows instead of height h.
 * Mapping extraction is incomplete/inaccurate: in ex1, it likely maps some colors (e.g., 2->something, 4->something) but applies them wrongly, leading to solid fills; in ex2, mappings like 4->7? are not applied correctly, resulting in unchanged or mismatched patterns.
 * Outlining logic fails core subtlety: for h>1 stacks, it only applies a minimal end-mask to the first row (k==0), then fills subsequent rows solidly with mapped color, ignoring interior bg fill—e.g., in ex1 row4, generates solid 4,4,4 and 2,2,2 instead of expected 8,4,8 (bg, mapped, bg) and similar hollow patterns.
 * In ex1, mismatches in rows 4,8,12 (0-indexed inner): generated has solid blocks like 2,2,2 / 4,4,4 where expected has interspersed bg (8) for hollowing, e.g., expected row4 has 8,4,8 instead of 4,4,4; row8 has 8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,8 vs generated solid; unknown why but likely due to no full-stack outlining.
 * In ex2, mismatches in rows 2-5,8-11 (inner): generated fills solidly like 4,4,4,4 / 7,7,7,7 / 8,8,8,8 where expected has irregular hollows/juts like 4,4,4,4 but then 7,7,1,1,1 / 7,7,7,7 / 8,1,1,8,1—suggests failed mapping application and no proper hollowing; e.g., row3 expected has 1's interrupting 7's, but generated ignores.
 * Function find_left_right is helpful but simplistic: finds overlapping 5-runs in top/bottom rows for frame width, works for these cases but may fail if no 5's in top/bottom inner.
 * Function to build stacks (grouping identical inner rows) is useful and mostly correct, but output_inner generation buggy: doesn't hollow full stack, applies mapping only to non-bg, and is_outline only for top row.
 * extract_mappings is partially helpful (catches some pairs) but broken for complex legends (e.g., skips valid pairs if followed by bg, doesn't overwrite mappings if multiple).
 * get_outline_mask is unhelpful/broken: too minimal (only edges, no interior True for sides in multi-row), doesn't differentiate top/side/bottom; don't use as-is, needs full perimeter logic per row type (top: full outline, middle: side only, bottom: full).
 * Overall, program understands frame/bg/stack structure (what worked) but fails object transformation (mappings + hollow outlining = what didn't), leading to solid blobs instead of hollow shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates solid filled objects (e.g., rows 3-6: full 9,9,9,9,9 and 2,2,2,2,2 blocks; rows 9-12: full 9's and 1,1,1,1,1 / 6,6,6,6,6; rows 15-18: full 7's and 1's) with no hollowing or interior bg (likely 4), and patterns don't match expected irregularity—e.g., upper object should probably have hollow 9's like 4,9,4 or similar based on training, but it's solid; lower parts similar. Mismatches suggest same issues as training: no full-stack outlining, possible wrong mappings (e.g., 9->? , 2->1? , etc.), and no juts/interruptions with bg. To handle test, need to apply mappings correctly (test legend likely maps 9->2? or similar, but output uses unmapped), and implement true hollowing for h>1 (e.g., middle rows: mapped on sides, bg inside).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns where borders are marked by 5's, and inner regions consist of colored blocks (numbers 1-9 representing colors) arranged in stacked, repeating rows that form shapes or objects. The goal is to transform the input grid by detecting a background color, deriving color mappings from the top section, grouping inner rows into vertical stacks of identical patterns, applying mappings to colors, and then "thinning" the top and bottom rows of each stack by reducing long runs of mapped colors to single instances separated by background, while leaving middle rows unchanged and preserving all-5 or all-background stacks.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Borders are always full rows/columns of 5's at top and bottom; left/right borders are inferred from the longest horizontal runs of 5's in those rows, but must overlap vertically for the inner region.
 * Background color is the most common non-5 color in the strict inner area (excluding borders); if no inner area or uniform 5's, default to 0, but this seems unused effectively.
 * Color mappings are extracted only from the top section (rows 0 to top inclusive? but code uses top+1), looking for adjacent runs of non-5/non-bg colors with length >=2; only the first such pair per row is used, and mappings are one-way (color -> next_color), applied by substitution.
 * Inner region is sliced excluding left/right borders; rows are grouped into "stacks" of consecutive identical rows, tracking height and if all-bg.
 * For transformation: Map all inner colors using the dict (bg stays bg); for non-all-bg stacks, top/bottom rows of the stack get "thinned" (long runs >2 become v-bg*(l-2)-v, short <=2 stay as-is, bg runs unchanged); middle rows stay fully mapped; all-bg stacks output plain bg rows.
 * Subtlety: Thinning only applies to the first and last row of each stack, not per individual row, to simulate "eroding" stack edges while preserving internal structure; this misses cases where stacks have varying patterns or mappings don't apply uniformly.
 * Stacks must be exact row matches for grouping; partial overlaps or non-repeating rows break this.
 * Output rebuilds full grid with 5 borders, inserting transformed inner rows starting from output row 1 to height-2.
 * Easy to miss: Mappings are sparse (only first pair per top row, and code breaks after first pair overall?), so not all colors map; unmapped colors stay original. Also, thinning doesn't handle vertical alignment or interactions between stacks.
 * Inner width is right-left-1, but slicing uses left+1:right, which excludes borders correctly but assumes uniform width.
 * No handling for multiple mappings per row or chaining; code skips 5/bg runs but may over-skip.
 * Puzzle assumes rectangular inner, no diagonals or irregular shapes; all patterns are axis-aligned blocks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies top/bottom borders via majority-5 rows and left/right via overlapping max 5-runs, which works for uniform-bordered examples.
 * Background detection via most-common non-5 in inner works in principle but isn't applied effectively since mappings often don't cover all colors.
 * Stack grouping by consecutive identical inner rows is a good insight for handling repeated patterns vertically, and distinguishing all-bg stacks avoids unnecessary processing.
 * Mapping extraction from top rows captures some substitutions (e.g., seems to map in example 1, but output suggests incomplete application like 2->8? wait, no clear mapping shown).
 * Thinning via build_thinned on stack top/bottom rows correctly erodes long runs to edges+bg fill, preserving short ones, which aligns with "outline" effect in expected.
 * What didn't work: In training 1, upper stack (rows 2-4) thinned row 4 incorrectly—generated full [2,2,2] and [4,4,4] blocks instead of expected thinned [2,2,2] but with middle row having 8's interrupting (expected row4: 2,2,2 then 8,4,8 etc., but gen has no interruption); lower similar mismatches, e.g., row8 expected thinned with 8's but gen has full 2,2,2 without. Suggests thinning applied wrong row or mapping missing (e.g., 4 not mapped?).
 * In training 1, bottom stack (rows 10-12) gen row12 as full 2,2,2 and 4,4,4 without thinning interruptions like expected 2,2,2 then 8,4,8; indicates build_thinned not triggering or wrong mapped input.
 * Training 2 completely mismatches: gen replicates input patterns without proper thinning or mapping—e.g., row2 gen full 4,4,4 blocks but expected has interruptions like 7,7,1,1,1; row3 gen full but expected partial; suggests mappings not derived (top has no clear pairs?) or not applied to stacks.
 * extract_mappings is broken: overly skips and breaks early (only one pair total?), missing multi-color tops; in ex2 top row2 has 4-1? but code may skip to bg=1? (bg likely 1 from inners).
 * build_thinned is helpful but unhelpful when applied to wrong rows (e.g., all rows in stack instead of just edges) or if mapped_row has bg interruptions already (code treats per-run, but may over-thin).
 * Overall, program understands stacking and thinning concept but fails on mapping completeness, stack row selection (applies thinning to every row in some cases?), and inner slicing (ex1 row4 gen has 8's but wrong positions vs expected interruptions).
 * No object extraction function present, but stack grouping acts as basic "object" segmentation vertically; could extend to horizontal for full shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it largely replicates the input patterns with minimal transformation—e.g., upper stack (rows 2-6) has full 9,9,9 blocks in rows 3-5 without thinning or interruptions, but based on training patterns, expected thinning on top/bottom of stack (rows 2 and 6) to 9-bg-9 or similar, and mapping from top (possibly 9->something from row2 patterns).
 * Middle stack (rows 8-12) gen full 9's and 2/6 blocks without edge thinning; expected likely thins row8 and12 to outlines, e.g., single 9's separated by bg=4.
 * Lower stack (rows 14-18) similar issue: full 8/2 blocks in rows 15-17, but row14/18 should thin to edges; also, no visible mapping applied (e.g., if top maps 9->2 or similar, but output unchanged).
 * All-bg rows (e.g., row7,13,19) correctly output as 4's (bg), but overall lacks the "eroded stack edges" seen in expected training (e.g., training1 has interruptions like 8's in thinned rows).
 * Test has wider grid (21 cols) with more complex multi-stack (upper 9's, middle 9+2+6, lower 8+2), so misses vertical interactions; output makes sense as a naive copy+partial-map but not as puzzle solution, since training shows need for per-stack edge modification to create outlined/shrunk shapes.
 * Without expected test, infer from training: output should have more bg interruptions in stack edges, possibly remapped colors (e.g., 9->4? but bg=4, unlikely); current gen ignores stack heights >3, applying uniform no-thinning.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and properties extracted from the provided examples (train inputs/outputs and test input). Only those with obvious, direct interactions or effects that are **consistent across EVERY example** (both train inputs/outputs and the test input) are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., individual small tile colors or positions that do not repeat consistently) are excluded. No high-level puzzle interpretation or full solution is attempted. Where a transformation or effect cannot be clearly explained as consistent and direct (e.g., exact pixel changes), it is noted as unknown rather than speculated.

#### Components Identified
- **Frame**: Orange-colored component with `holes=1`. Present in all inputs and both train outputs. Acts as a rectangular border/outline (pixels suggest sparse/thin structure relative to bbox size, e.g., 64 pixels for ~18x14 area in train 1).
- **Inner Background**: Large component (variable color: Maroon in train 1, Blue in train 2, Yellow in test) with high `holes` count (10 in train 1, 6 in train 2, 7 in test). Positioned within the frame's bbox. Fills space inside the frame (high pixels relative to bbox, e.g., 131-186 pixels for ~16x12 to 18x18 areas).
- **Outer Background**: Large component (variable color: Maroon in train 1, Blue in train 2, Yellow in test) with low `holes` count (2-3 in trains, 7 in test but still lower than inner relative to size). Encompasses the entire scene (largest bbox starting at or near [0,0]).
- **Small Tiles**: Scattered small components (various colors, all with `holes=0` and low pixels: 2-25). These are solid blocks/polyomino-like (no holes, irregular bboxes suggesting L/U shapes based on pixel counts and bbox ratios). Present in all inputs and rearranged in train outputs. Only general properties noted below, as specific color/position interactions vary and are not consistent across all.

Components like small Maroons or Blues with holes>0 in the test input are excluded, as they lack consistency (no holes>0 in small tiles across trains).

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are direct, observable links (e.g., one property affecting another's value or transformation) that hold in **every** input and (where applicable) train output. No forced or inconsistent links (e.g., small tile color -> position) are included.

1. **Frame Position -> Inner Background Position**:
   - The inner background's bbox is consistently positioned as an inset within the frame's bbox: inner_minx = frame_minx + 1, inner_miny = frame_miny + 1, inner_maxx = frame_maxx - 1, inner_maxy = frame_maxy - 1.
   - Consistent in: All inputs (train 1: frame [3,8,21,22] -> inner [4,9,20,21]; train 2: [5,8,22,20] -> [6,9,21,19]; test: [0,9,20,29] -> [1,10,19,28]).
   - In train outputs: This relationship is preserved after frame repositioning (frame moves to [0,0,frame_w,frame_h], inner adjusts to [1,1,frame_w-1,frame_h-1]; e.g., train 1 output: frame [0,0,18,14] -> inner [1,1,17,13]).
   - Effect: Frame bbox boundaries directly constrain and define the inner background's spatial extent (1-unit margin on all sides).

2. **Frame Dimensions -> Inner Background Dimensions**:
   - Inner background dimensions are consistently derived from frame: inner_width = frame_width - 2, inner_height = frame_height - 2.
   - Consistent in: All inputs (train 1: frame 18x14 -> inner 16x12; train 2: 17x12 -> 15x10; test: 20x20 -> 18x18).
   - In train outputs: Dimensions preserved (repositioned but unchanged; e.g., train 1 output inner remains 16x12).
   - Effect: Frame size directly determines inner size (subtract 2 units, matching the 1-unit inset on each side).

3. **Outer Background Position -> Frame and Inner Background Position**:
   - The frame and inner background are always fully contained within the outer background's bbox (outer_minx <= frame_minx, outer_miny <= frame_miny, etc.).
   - Consistent in: All inputs (e.g., train 1 outer [0,0,23,22] contains frame [3,8,21,22] and inner [4,9,20,21]; similar for train 2 and test).
   - In train outputs: Outer background is absent; frame and inner are repositioned independently (no longer contained in an outer).
   - Effect: In inputs, outer bbox acts as a container/encompasser for frame and inner positions. Transformation in outputs removes this containment (unknown reason for removal).

4. **Small Tiles Properties -> No Direct Consistent Interaction with Frame/Backgrounds**:
   - All small tiles consistently have `holes=0` (no variation or effect from other components).
   - Small tiles are positioned outside the inner background but inside the outer background in all inputs (no overlap with frame/inner bboxes).
   - In train outputs: Small tiles are repositioned inside the inner background's new bbox (e.g., output 1 tiles at [2,2,4,4], [6,2,8,4], etc., within inner [1,1,17,13]).
   - Effect: General spatial shift (outside inner -> inside inner), but specific positions, colors, or pixel changes vary (e.g., input pixels 5-9 -> output 6-8; colors like Green/Blue -> Red/Yellow in train 1, but Red/Pink -> Maroon/Yellow in train 2). No consistent property-based transformation identifiable (e.g., position -> color or pixels -> new position unknown).

5. **Inner Background Pixels -> Unknown Transformation in Outputs**:
   - In train outputs only: Inner pixels increase by exactly 20 (train 1: 131 -> 151; train 2: 80 -> 100). No test output to verify.
   - Consistent in: Both train input/output pairs.
   - Effect: Fixed additive change (+20 pixels), independent of input pixels, holes, or size. Reason unknown (no clear link to other properties like frame pixels=64/58 or small tile counts).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., hole count -> color, small tile adjacency -> transformation) are observable across all examples. Small tile colors and exact shapes (e.g., L/U based on pixels/bbox) do not show repeatable effects on other components.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
