=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 01:36:41] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 01:45:32] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 possibly empty but backgrounds are non-zero), and the goal is to identify distinct connected shapes (blobs of the same color, excluding the background), normalize their positions and orientations to a standard form, and rearrange them into a new larger grid framed by the background color, with shapes placed in a specific spatial layout (e.g., horizontally adjacent or in rows/columns based on original positions) rather than simply stacked.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other colors represent potential shapes, but only connected components (4-connected, via flood fill) of size >=4 cells are considered "main shapes"—smaller blobs are ignored.
 * Shapes must be extracted per color, taking the largest component per color if multiple exist (as in the code's components_by_color logic).
 * Normalization involves translating the shape to (0,0) top-left, then optionally rotating 90 degrees clockwise if height >= width (to prefer wider orientations?), checking for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top half) and flipping vertically if so, then trimming empty space from top/left to re-minimize bounding box— this seems partially correct but may over-rotate or flip in ways that distort shapes relative to expected outputs.
 * Arrangement is key: the code stacks shapes vertically into a square inner canvas (summing heights, max width, padding to square), then adds a 1-cell border, but expected outputs place shapes horizontally adjacent (e.g., in example 1, 8's left, 1's middle-right, 3's bottom-right; in example 2, shapes like 4's and 6's are split across rows/columns), suggesting sorting by original min row position and placing side-by-side or in a grid layout to fit within a bordered frame matching input dimensions or expanded minimally.
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by min row of positions, which is good for vertical order, but expected seems to preserve horizontal relationships or place in original relative positions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs expand the grid (e.g., example 1 input likely 10x10 becomes 12x12 framed), with empty space filled by background; shapes don't overlap and are not rotated/flipped in ways that change their relative "up" direction—code's bottom-heavy flip may be unnecessary or wrongly applied.
 * Handle empty/whitespace: Grids may have irregular shapes; ensure no overwriting during placement.
 * Colors: Preserve original colors; background frames everything.
 * Edge cases: Multiple components per color (take largest); no shapes (return minimal bg grid); varying input sizes.
 * Puzzle rules imply preserving shape integrity—no scaling, just translation/rotation/flip for canonical form, then precise placement to match a "composed" image where shapes are juxtaposed as if "cut out" and reassembled in a new composition.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the most common non-zero as bg, useful for framing and exclusion.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components per color.)

```python
def extract_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components_by_color = {}
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                size = len(component)
                if size >= 4:
                    if color not in components_by_color or size > len(components_by_color[color][1]):
                        components_by_color[color] = (color, component)
    shapes = list(components_by_color.values())
    shapes.sort(key=lambda x: min(pr for pr, pc in x[1]))
    return shapes
```
(This is helpful for identifying and sorting largest shapes by min row, but may need adjustment to handle multiple per color or different sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2) and extracts main shapes via flood fill, ignoring small components and bg— this worked for finding the right colors and rough positions.
 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs.

 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...

[2025-10-01 01:56:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors in an input grid, normalize their positions, orientations, and shapes to a standard form (e.g., top-left aligned, possibly rotated or flipped for consistency), and then rearrange them horizontally side-by-side in a new output grid filled with the background color, ensuring the overall output is a square grid with optional bordering padding while preserving the relative internal structure of each shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the dominant color in the grid (most frequent non-zero value), but it may surround shapes or fill large areas; do not treat zero as background unless specified, and ensure shapes are only extracted if they are connected components of the same color with at least a minimum size (e.g., >=4 cells in the code, but this threshold may be arbitrary or unnecessary).
 * Shapes must be extracted via flood fill on connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right), ignoring background and other colors; small or isolated cells (<4) are skipped, which worked but may over-filter if shapes are small.
 * Normalization is crucial: translate shapes to (0,0) origin (min row/col = 0), determine bounding box height/width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise if height > width to make them landscape-oriented, flip horizontally if the bottom half has more mass on the right than left (to standardize "facing" or asymmetry), and re-normalize origin after transformations; this attempts to canonicalize shapes but fails in examples due to incorrect rotation/flipping logic (e.g., over-rotates or flips asymmetrically, leading to distorted placements).
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by minimum row position in original grid (top-to-bottom order of first appearance), which may be correct for reading order but doesn't match expected horizontal left-to-right arrangement in outputs.
 * Placement: Shapes are placed side-by-side horizontally in rows, aligned to the top of the output grid, with their normalized widths added cumulatively; add 1-cell borders top/bottom/left/right around the entire arrangement, then pad to make the output square by adding background rows/columns centered (e.g., if wider than tall, add rows in the middle); total output size should match the minimal square enclosing the bordered arrangement, but code over-pads massively (e.g., +2 borders then squaring leads to oversized grids).
 * Subtleties: Preserve exact relative positions within each shape (no stretching/compression); do not merge shapes or alter colors; output must exactly match expected dimensions and cell values, including background fills; in examples, shapes are abutted directly without gaps between them, but bordered overall; rotations/flips must ensure shapes "face" consistently (e.g., bottom-heavy or asymmetric shapes flipped to standardize); minimum shape size (>=4) skips noise but may miss valid small shapes; background identification counts only non-zero, but if all zero, defaults to 0—ensure it doesn't misidentify shapes as background.
 * Edge cases: Grids with no shapes return single background cell; varying shape sizes require dynamic max height for vertical alignment; if arrangement is taller than wide post-border, pad columns centered; test input has multiple shapes (colors 8,3,5,9,6?) that need sequential horizontal placement without distortion.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid re-processing; use deque for BFS efficiency; counter for background via frequency; handle empty grids; sorting by y-position assumes vertical scanning order, but examples suggest left-to-right or appearance order; final squaring pads symmetrically but code's half = extra//2 may off-center if odd; generated outputs show shapes concatenated horizontally but with wrong normalization (e.g., 8's block is too wide/tall, 1's misplaced), leading to non-matching dimensions (14x14 vs expected 12x12 for train1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This works well for finding the most frequent non-background color as bg, but may need adjustment if bg is zero or sparse.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of the same color, avoiding background and other shapes; use it in future attempts.)

```python
def get_h_w(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in positions)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```
(This correctly computes bounding box height/width from positions; helpful for normalization and placement sizing.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (The full function from the code is partially helpful for origin translation and basic rotation/flip, but broken in rotation logic—if h > w, it rotates but then swaps h/w incorrectly, and flip condition based on bottom-half mass is heuristic but misapplies, leading to distorted shapes; salvage the translation parts but rewrite rotation/flip.)
```
(Partially helpful for translation to (0,0) and bounding box calc, but the rotation (if h>w, rotate to landscape then flip vertically?) and flip (bottom-right > bottom-left mass) are flawed and cause mismatches; do not reuse as-is, but adapt the min_r/min_c normalization.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 for train1, 3 for train2) and extracts components via flood fill, skipping small ones (>=4 cells), which worked for finding main shapes but may be too strict.
 * Normalization attempts to standardize orientation (rotate if tall, flip if asymmetric) but fails: for train1, the 8-shape is rotated/flipped into a 4x4 block instead of expected 4-high x 4-wide with cutout; 1-shape becomes 2x2 but misplaced; 3-shape distorted to 2-high x 6-wide but wrong alignment.
 * Placement sorts shapes by min row (vertical order), then concatenates horizontally with no gaps, adds borders, and pads to square—but over-pads (e.g., train1 becomes 14x14 instead of 12x12, with shapes centered wrongly in rows 6-9 instead of rows 3-10 top-aligned); for train2, shapes are crammed into rows 12-16 with huge background overhead (28x28 vs expected ~20x20), and order wrong (1's,5's,4's,6's misplaced relative to expected vertical-ish but horizontal arrangement).
 * Train1 generated: Shapes horizontally concatenated but normalized wrongly (8's too blocky/wide, 1's shifted right, 3's bottom-heavy flip failed), dimensions oversized with borders, shapes in middle rows 6-9 with top/bottom all-bg rows; expected: 12x12, shapes top-aligned in rows 3-10, 8's left (4w), then 1's (2w), then 3's (6w max), with precise cutouts (e.g., 8's have 2-wide bottom).
 * Train2 generated: All-bg top 11 rows, shapes in 12-16 (1's left, then 5's/4's/6's distorted/wrong widths), bottom all-bg; expected: More compact ~20x20, shapes in scattered rows (e.g., 4's mid-right rows 3-8, 6's lower rows 11-16, 1's bottom rows 19-26, 5's integrated), horizontal but with vertical spacing preserved? Wait, expected seems to rearrange in appearance order horizontally per "section" but code linearizes wrongly.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken (rotation swaps h/w but positions list incorrectly, flip miscalculates mass leading to upside-down or mirrored shapes); do not use as-is.
 * Overall, component extraction essential and works, but sorting/placement/padding logic misses top-alignment, exact widths, and minimal sizing; unknown why train2 expected has shapes not strictly horizontal (e.g., 1's at bottom, 5's overlapping sections)—may need order by first appearance x-then-y, not just y.
 * Test output generated: A massive ~32x48 grid (way oversized from over-padding/squaring), mostly all 4's (bg), with shapes only in rows 18-20 (8's left long block, then 3's/5's/9's/6's concatenated but distorted: 8's 3-high x10-wide instead of structured, 9's 3-high x9-wide blocky, 6's trailing); this does not look correct—expected should be compact square (maybe 20x20+), shapes normalized and top-aligned horizontally in order of appearance (likely 8,3,5,9,6 from positions), preserving cutouts (e.g., 8's probably L or irregular, not solid; 9's stepped, 6's bar-like), with 1-cell borders and centered padding if needed, not this huge empty expanse; differences: wrong dims/shape integrity/placement, shapes merged/distorted without gaps but wrong orientations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it is an oversized rectangular-then-squared grid (~32 rows x 48 cols, padded to square?) with excessive background, shapes only in a narrow band (rows 18-20), and visible distortions (e.g., 8's as solid 10-wide bar instead of expected irregular form with holes/cutouts, 9's blocky without steps, overall not top-aligned or compact).
 * The test output is missing proper normalization (no rotation/flip to standard, leading to raw concatenated widths totaling ~40+), exact shape preservation (flood fill captures but transforms break structure), and minimal sizing (should be ~22x22 bordered square based on max h~8-10, total w~30-40, pad to square).
 * Make sure to account for multiple asymmetric shapes (e.g., 3's small, 5's/6's medium, 9's large stepped, 8's complex) by improving flip/rotate heuristics and sorting by scan order (row-major left-to-right-top-to-bottom) to handle test case; unknown why generated is so vertically centered with huge top/bottom bg, but likely from code's +2 borders then aggressive squaring without trimming.

[2025-10-01 01:56:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 possibly empty but backgrounds are non-zero), and the goal is to identify distinct connected shapes (blobs of the same color, excluding the background), normalize their positions and orientations to a standard form, and rearrange them into a new larger grid framed by the background color, with shapes placed in a specific spatial layout (e.g., horizontally adjacent or in rows/columns based on original positions) rather than simply stacked.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other colors represent potential shapes, but only connected components (4-connected, via flood fill) of size >=4 cells are considered "main shapes"—smaller blobs are ignored.
 * Shapes must be extracted per color, taking the largest component per color if multiple exist (as in the code's components_by_color logic).
 * Normalization involves translating the shape to (0,0) top-left, then optionally rotating 90 degrees clockwise if height >= width (to prefer wider orientations?), checking for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top half) and flipping vertically if so, then trimming empty space from top/left to re-minimize bounding box— this seems partially correct but may over-rotate or flip in ways that distort shapes relative to expected outputs.
 * Arrangement is key: the code stacks shapes vertically into a square inner canvas (summing heights, max width, padding to square), then adds a 1-cell border, but expected outputs place shapes horizontally adjacent (e.g., in example 1, 8's left, 1's middle-right, 3's bottom-right; in example 2, shapes like 4's and 6's are split across rows/columns), suggesting sorting by original min row position and placing side-by-side or in a grid layout to fit within a bordered frame matching input dimensions or expanded minimally.
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by min row of positions, which is good for vertical order, but expected seems to preserve horizontal relationships or place in original relative positions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs expand the grid (e.g., example 1 input likely 10x10 becomes 12x12 framed), with empty space filled by background; shapes don't overlap and are not rotated/flipped in ways that change their relative "up" direction—code's bottom-heavy flip may be unnecessary or wrongly applied.
 * Handle empty/whitespace: Grids may have irregular shapes; ensure no overwriting during placement.
 * Colors: Preserve original colors; background frames everything.
 * Edge cases: Multiple components per color (take largest); no shapes (return minimal bg grid); varying input sizes.
 * Puzzle rules imply preserving shape integrity—no scaling, just translation/rotation/flip for canonical form, then precise placement to match a "composed" image where shapes are juxtaposed as if "cut out" and reassembled in a new composition.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the most common non-zero as bg, useful for framing and exclusion.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components per color.)

```python
def extract_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components_by_color = {}
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                size = len(component)
                if size >= 4:
                    if color not in components_by_color or size > len(components_by_color[color][1]):
                        components_by_color[color] = (color, component)
    shapes = list(components_by_color.values())
    shapes.sort(key=lambda x: min(pr for pr, pc in x[1]))
    return shapes
```
(This is helpful for identifying and sorting largest shapes by min row, but may need adjustment to handle multiple per color or different sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2) and extracts main shapes via flood fill, ignoring small components and bg— this worked for finding the right colors and rough positions.
 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

 * Train1 generated: Shapes horizontally concatenated but normalized wrongly (8's too blocky/wide, 1's shifted right, 3's bottom-heavy flip failed), dimensions oversized with borders, shapes in middle rows 6-9 with top/bottom all-bg rows; expected: 12x12, shapes top-aligned in rows 3-10, 8's left (4w), then 1's (2w), then 3's (6w max), with precise cutouts (e.g., 8's have 2-wide bottom).
 * Train2 generated: All-bg top 11 rows, shapes in 12-16 (1's left, then 5's/4's/6's distorted/wrong widths), bottom all-bg; expected: More compact ~20x20, shapes in scattered rows (e.g., 4's mid-right rows 3-8, 6's lower rows 11-16, 1's bottom rows 19-26, 5's integrated), horizontal but with vertical spacing preserved? Wait, expected seems to rearrange in appearance order horizontally per "section" but code linearizes wrongly.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken (rotation swaps h/w but positions list incorrectly, flip miscalculates mass leading to upside-down or mirrored shapes); do not use as-is.
 * Overall, component extraction essential and works, but sorting/placement/padding logic misses top-alignment, exact widths, and minimal sizing; unknown why train2 expected has shapes not strictly horizontal (e.g., 1's at bottom, 5's overlapping sections)—may need order by first appearance x-then-y, not just y.
 * Test output generated: A massive ~32x48 grid (way oversized from over-padding/squaring), mostly all 4's (bg), with shapes only in rows 18-20 (8's left long block, then 3's/5's/9's/6's concatenated but distorted: 8's 3-high x10-wide instead of structured, 9's 3-high x9-wide blocky, 6's trailing); this does not look correct—expected should be compact square (maybe 20x20+), shapes normalized and top-aligned horizontally in order of appearance (likely 8,3,5,9,6 from positions), preserving cutouts (e.g., 8's probably L or irregular, not solid; 9's stepped, 6's bar-like), with 1-cell borders and centered padding if needed, not this huge empty expanse; differences: wrong dims/shape integrity/placement, shapes merged/distorted without gaps but wrong orientations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it is an oversized rectangular-then-squared grid (~32 rows x 48 cols, padded to square?) with excessive background, shapes only in a narrow band (rows 18-20), and visible distortions (e.g., 8's as solid 10-wide bar instead of expected irregular form with holes/cutouts, 9's blocky without steps, overall not top-aligned or compact).
 * The test output is missing proper normalization (no rotation/flip to standard, leading to raw concatenated widths totaling ~40+), exact shape preservation (flood fill captures but transforms break structure), and minimal sizing (should be ~22x22 bordered square based on max h~8-10, total w~30-40, pad to square).
 * Make sure to account for multiple asymmetric shapes (e.g., 3's small, 5's/6's medium, 9's large stepped, 8's complex) by improving flip/rotate heuristics and sorting by scan order (row-major left-to-right-top-to-bottom) to handle test case; unknown why generated is so vertically centered with huge top/bottom bg, but likely from code's +2 borders then aggressive squaring without trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....

[2025-10-01 02:05:05] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting connected components (blobs) of the same non-background color from an input grid, filtering out small ones (less than 4 cells), normalizing their positions to a local origin, optionally rotating them to prefer landscape orientation, sorting them by their original top-left positions, and then reassembling them into a new compact grid with a background border and padding to a square shape. The goal is to create a "catalog" or standardized rendering of the extracted shapes while preserving their identities and relative ordering, but the current approach fails in arrangement, leading to mismatched layouts compared to expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color (or 0 if none); all other colors are treated as foreground for components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and same-color; only extract those with >=4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalize each component by translating positions relative to its min_r and min_c, compute its bounding box height (h) and width (w).
 * Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if h > w (tall shapes) to make them wider, updating positions as (c, h-1-r); this prefers horizontal/landscape shapes but may alter visual orientation subtly.
 * Sort extracted shapes by original (min_r, min_c) to process in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, mimicking reading order.
 * Arrangement is critical: current horizontal side-by-side placement creates a thin strip, but expected outputs suggest a more grid-like or vertically stacked layout that preserves relative vertical positioning (e.g., top shapes above bottom ones, with horizontal alignment within rows).
 * Add a 1-cell border of background around the inner arrangement, then pad the entire grid to the nearest square (max dimension) with background, centering the content.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs have consistent sizing (e.g., 12x12 for training 1, 20x20 for training 2), implying the inner arrangement's max_h and total_w determine the final side length after border (+2) and padding.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may overlap or align in the new grid based on original relative positions, but current code ignores vertical offsets and packs everything into one row; also, rotation may misalign shapes if the puzzle expects no rotation or different rotation logic.
 * Handle empty grids or no valid components by returning a single background cell.
 * Outputs use lists of lists, with rows as lists of ints; ensure deep copies to avoid mutation.
 * Potential edge: Shapes with irregular bounding boxes (e.g., L-shapes) must fill their relative positions correctly without gaps in the new grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common non-zero color; useful for distinguishing foreground.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This performs standard 4-connected flood fill for same-color components; essential for extracting blobs accurately.)

```python
def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts and filters components >=4 cells, with min_r/min_c for sorting; core to identifying valid shapes, but note it skips background cells correctly.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    relative = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]
    h = max(r for r, _ in relative) + 1
    w = max(c for _, c in relative) + 1
    return relative, h, w
```
(This normalizes shape positions to (0,0) origin and computes tight bounding box; helpful for isolating shapes.)

```python
def rotate_if_tall(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if h <= w:
        return positions, h, w
    new_positions = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]
    new_h = w
    new_w = h
    return new_positions, new_h, new_w
```
(This rotates tall shapes to landscape; useful but may be a subtlety—puzzle might not require rotation, or it could be causing mismatches in shape orientation.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    new_h = gh + 2
    new_w = gw + 2
    new_grid = [[bg] * new_w for _ in range(new_h)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This adds a 1-cell background border; correct and necessary for framing.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    side = max(gh, gw)
    if gh == 0 or gw == 0:
        return [[bg]]
    if side == gh == gw:
        return [row[:] for row in grid]  # copy
    new_grid = [[bg] * side for _ in range(side)]
    offset_r = (side - gh) // 2
    offset_c = (side - gw) // 2
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[offset_r + i][offset_c + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This centers and pads to square with background; works well but amplifies issues if inner grid is imbalanced.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters components (>=4 cells), normalizes positions, and applies optional rotation, but fails in sorting and arrangement: shapes are sorted by (min_r, min_c) but placed horizontally side-by-side in a single row, creating a thin inner grid (e.g., height ~2-4, wide total_w), leading to many empty rows after bordering and square-padding.
 * For training example 1: Generated a 14x14 grid with all shapes crammed into rows 5-8 (8's left, 1's middle, 3's right, but misaligned and no vertical separation), surrounded by 2's border and top/bottom padding; expected is 12x12 with 8's top-left (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1's top-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9), 3's bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 8-13, horizontal), preserving vertical ordering and compactness—generated mismatches by flattening to one row and oversized padding.
 * For training example 2: Generated a 28x28 grid (way oversized) with 10+ empty rows top/bottom, shapes crammed into rows 11-16 (1's left, 5's scattered, 4's/6's middle-right, but jumbled and no grid structure); expected is 20x20 with shapes in a multi-row layout (4's/5's top-middle rows 2-7, 6's middle rows 10-15, 1's bottom rows 18-25, with vertical stacking and horizontal alignment within "rows" of shapes)—generated differs by horizontal packing, wrong size, and poor alignment (e.g., 1's and 5's fragmented).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order but doesn't account for vertical grouping; build_inner_grid is broken for multi-row arrangements—needs to place shapes in rows based on original min_r buckets or similar.
 * Rotation may be unhelpful or incorrect: e.g., in training 1, 3's is horizontal in expected but might be rotated if tall; don't use if it distorts expected shapes.
 * Flood_fill and extract_raw_components are essential and correct for component detection; translate_to_origin is helpful for normalization.
 * add_border and pad_to_square are correct but highlight arrangement flaws (e.g., thin inner -> empty square).
 * Overall, extraction works (shapes identified correctly), but rearrangement doesn't mimic the expected "poster" or "inventory" layout with vertical stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it's a massive ~48x48? grid (inferred from 48 elements per row) mostly filled with background 4's (empty rows 0-16 and 20-47), with shapes crammed into only rows 17-19 (8's left spanning multiple rows but flattened, 3's/5's/9's/6's jumbled horizontally without vertical separation or alignment, e.g., 8's block rows 17-19 cols 1-9, then scattered smaller blobs like 3's at cols 10-12, 5's at 13-21, etc., ending with 6's right).
 * It differs from what we'd expect (based on training): should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with extracted shapes (8,3,5,9,6 colors visible) arranged in a multi-row grid layout (e.g., larger 8's block top, smaller ones below/right, bordered by 4's, centered), preserving relative original positions vertically; instead, horizontal cramming creates imbalance, no stacking (all in 3 rows), and excessive empty space, suggesting the same arrangement bug as training examples.
 * Shapes seem extracted correctly (e.g., large 8's, 9's block, 6's), but placement ignores vertical offsets—e.g., if test has vertically separated shapes, they should stack, not inline; rotation might have flipped some (unknown if needed).
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too sparse/empty, mismatched size, no visual "catalog" structure; likely fails if test expects similar to training 2's stacked layout.

[2025-10-01 02:05:12] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements/properties across **both** train examples (train input 1 ↔ output 1, and train input 2 ↔ output 2). These are limited to patterns that appear identically in every case, without speculation, high-level interpretation, or attempts to explain mechanisms. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., text labels, standalone small squares without clear ties, or one-off positions) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact rules for repositioning) are explicitly noted as such. No connections are forced if not evident in the data.

#### 1. **Single-Pixel Red Elements (Dark Red, Maroon, or Red with pixels=1, holes=0) → Removal**
   - **Description**: These are scattered single-pixel markers (bbox typically 1x1, e.g., [x,y,x,y]) in red variants.
   - **Interaction**: Consistently present in all inputs (8 in train 1, 8 in train 2). Completely absent in all outputs. No preservation of position, color, or count.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every puzzle; they do not interact with or transfer to any other specific component (e.g., no clear absorption into shapes). Possible role as temporary connectors or modifiers, but transformation details unknown.
   - **Affected Properties**: Position (irrelevant post-removal), color (red variants), pixels (always 1), holes (always 0).

#### 2. **Holed Shape (Any Color with holes >0) → Pixel Count Multiplication and Bbox Expansion**
   - **Description**: Exactly one shape per input has holes >0 (Red with holes=3, pixels=28 in train 1; Green with holes=5, pixels=121 in train 2). These are larger polyominoes (pixels >20, bbox spanning multiple grid units).
   - **Interaction**: Pixel count is consistently multiplied by 4 (28 → 112 in train 1; 121 → 484 in train 2). Holes count preserved exactly (3 → 3; 5 → 5). Bbox expands significantly in both dimensions (e.g., [0,0,5,5] → [0,0,11,11] in train 1; [20,0,29,13] → [0,0,19,27] in train 2), often shifting position (e.g., to top-left origin). Color preserved (Red → Red; Green → Green).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every puzzle for the single holed shape; no other shapes exhibit this. No interaction with single red pixels evident (e.g., pixel increase not tied to red count: 84 added in train 1 vs. 363 in train 2, despite similar red counts).
   - **Affected Properties**: Holes count → triggers transformation; pixels → scaled by fixed factor (4); bbox (position and size) → expanded/relocated; color → unchanged.
   - **Unknown**: Exact expansion logic (e.g., how bbox dimensions are calculated beyond scaling).

#### 3. **Non-Holed Polyomino Shapes (Colors like Blue, Green, Maroon, Orange, Pink, Yellow with holes=0, pixels ≥4) → Pixel Preservation and Bbox Repositioning**
   - **Description**: Multiple polyomino shapes per input (e.g., Blue pixels=4, Maroon=12, Green=16 in train 1; Blue=24, Green=121 [but holed, so excluded here], Yellow=24, Pink=20, Orange=4 in train 2).
   - **Interaction**: Pixel count preserved exactly (e.g., 4→4, 12→12, 16→16 in train 1; 24→24, 20→20, 4→4 in train 2). Holes remain 0. Color preserved. Bbox changes position and sometimes size/aspect (e.g., Blue [2,10,3,11] → [8,2,9,3] in train 1; Yellow [11,8,18,13] → [10,2,17,7] in train 2), but no pixel scaling.
   - **Consistency**: Applies to all non-holed shapes in every puzzle; holed shapes follow rule #2 instead. No merging or splitting observed.
   - **Affected Properties**: Pixels → unchanged; color → unchanged; holes → unchanged (0); bbox (position/size) → transformed.
   - **Unknown**: Repositioning logic (e.g., no consistent position-to-position mapping, such as relative to reds or other shapes; appears irregular).

#### 4. **Background Color → Change to Red**
   - **Description**: Implicit neutral black background in inputs; explicit solid red framing/composition in outputs.
   - **Interaction**: Consistently shifts from black (input) to red (output). No pixel or bbox data for background itself, but it frames all output shapes.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every puzzle; may interact with expanded holed shape (e.g., output bbox often starts at [0,0] aligning with red background), but no direct tie to other elements.
   - **Affected Properties**: Color → black → red.
   - **Unknown**: Whether background absorbs/interacts with removed red pixels or expanded shape (no data confirms).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no reliable color-to-color transfers, hole count influencing non-holed shapes, or position-based effects like "proximity to red → movement" that hold across both examples). Elements like potential text/semantic labels or standalone small squares (e.g., pixels=4 blocks) do not show clear, consistent ties in the blob data and are excluded.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 02:05:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 possibly empty but backgrounds are non-zero), and the goal is to identify distinct connected shapes (blobs of the same color, excluding the background), normalize their positions and orientations to a standard form, and rearrange them into a new larger grid framed by the background color, with shapes placed in a specific spatial layout (e.g., horizontally adjacent or in rows/columns based on original positions) rather than simply stacked.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other colors represent potential shapes, but only connected components (4-connected, via flood fill) of size >=4 cells are considered "main shapes"—smaller blobs are ignored.
 * Shapes must be extracted per color, taking the largest component per color if multiple exist (as in the code's components_by_color logic).
 * Normalization involves translating the shape to (0,0) top-left, then optionally rotating 90 degrees clockwise if height >= width (to prefer wider orientations?), checking for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top half) and flipping vertically if so, then trimming empty space from top/left to re-minimize bounding box— this seems partially correct but may over-rotate or flip in ways that distort shapes relative to expected outputs.
 * Arrangement is key: the code stacks shapes vertically into a square inner canvas (summing heights, max width, padding to square), then adds a 1-cell border, but expected outputs place shapes horizontally adjacent (e.g., in example 1, 8's left, 1's middle-right, 3's bottom-right; in example 2, shapes like 4's and 6's are split across rows/columns), suggesting sorting by original min row position and placing side-by-side or in a grid layout to fit within a bordered frame matching input dimensions or expanded minimally.
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by min row of positions, which is good for vertical order, but expected seems to preserve horizontal relationships or place in original relative positions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs expand the grid (e.g., example 1 input likely 10x10 becomes 12x12 framed), with empty space filled by background; shapes don't overlap and are not rotated/flipped in ways that change their relative "up" direction—code's bottom-heavy flip may be unnecessary or wrongly applied.
 * Handle empty/whitespace: Grids may have irregular shapes; ensure no overwriting during placement.
 * Colors: Preserve original colors; background frames everything.
 * Edge cases: Multiple components per color (take largest); no shapes (return minimal bg grid); varying input sizes.
 * Puzzle rules imply preserving shape integrity—no scaling, just translation/rotation/flip for canonical form, then precise placement to match a "composed" image where shapes are juxtaposed as if "cut out" and reassembled in a new composition.

        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the most common non-zero as bg, useful for framing and exclusion.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components per color.)

```python
def extract_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components_by_color = {}
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                size = len(component)
                if size >= 4:
                    if color not in components_by_color or size > len(components_by_color[color][1]):
                        components_by_color[color] = (color, component)
    shapes = list(components_by_color.values())
    shapes.sort(key=lambda x: min(pr for pr, pc in x[1]))
    return shapes
```
(This is helpful for identifying and sorting largest shapes by min row, but may need adjustment to handle multiple per color or different sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2) and extracts main shapes via flood fill, ignoring small components and bg— this worked for finding the right colors and rough positions.
 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors in an input grid, normalize their positions, orientations, and shapes to a standard form (e.g., top-left aligned, possibly rotated or flipped for consistency), and then rearrange them horizontally side-by-side in a new output grid filled with the background color, ensuring the overall output is a square grid with optional bordering padding while preserving the relative internal structure of each shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the dominant color in the grid (most frequent non-zero value), but it may surround shapes or fill large areas; do not treat zero as background unless specified, and ensure shapes are only extracted if they are connected components of the same color with at least a minimum size (e.g., >=4 cells in the code, but this threshold may be arbitrary or unnecessary).
 * Shapes must be extracted via flood fill on connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right), ignoring background and other colors; small or isolated cells (<4) are skipped, which worked but may over-filter if shapes are small.
 * Normalization is crucial: translate shapes to (0,0) origin (min row/col = 0), determine bounding box height/width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise if height > width to make them landscape-oriented, flip horizontally if the bottom half has more mass on the right than left (to standardize "facing" or asymmetry), and re-normalize origin after transformations; this attempts to canonicalize shapes but fails in examples due to incorrect rotation/flipping logic (e.g., over-rotates or flips asymmetrically, leading to distorted placements).
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by minimum row position in original grid (top-to-bottom order of first appearance), which may be correct for reading order but doesn't match expected horizontal left-to-right arrangement in outputs.
 * Placement: Shapes are placed side-by-side horizontally in rows, aligned to the top of the output grid, with their normalized widths added cumulatively; add 1-cell borders top/bottom/left/right around the entire arrangement, then pad to make the output square by adding background rows/columns centered (e.g., if wider than tall, add rows in the middle); total output size should match the minimal square enclosing the bordered arrangement, but code over-pads massively (e.g., +2 borders then squaring leads to oversized grids).
 * Subtleties: Preserve exact relative positions within each shape (no stretching/compression); do not merge shapes or alter colors; output must exactly match expected dimensions and cell values, including background fills; in examples, shapes are abutted directly without gaps between them, but bordered overall; rotations/flips must ensure shapes "face" consistently (e.g., bottom-heavy or asymmetric shapes flipped to standardize); minimum shape size (>=4) skips noise but may miss valid small shapes; background identification counts only non-zero, but if all zero, defaults to 0—ensure it doesn't misidentify shapes as background.
 * Edge cases: Grids with no shapes return single background cell; varying shape sizes require dynamic max height for vertical alignment; if arrangement is taller than wide post-border, pad columns centered; test input has multiple shapes (colors 8,3,5,9,6?) that need sequential horizontal placement without distortion.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid re-processing; use deque for BFS efficiency; counter for background via frequency; handle empty grids; sorting by y-position assumes vertical scanning order, but examples suggest left-to-right or appearance order; final squaring pads symmetrically but code's half = extra//2 may off-center if odd; generated outputs show shapes concatenated horizontally but with wrong normalization (e.g., 8's block is too wide/tall, 1's misplaced), leading to non-matching dimensions (14x14 vs expected 12x12 for train1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This works well for finding the most frequent non-background color as bg, but may need adjustment if bg is zero or sparse.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of the same color, avoiding background and other shapes; use it in future attempts.)

```python
def get_h_w(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in positions)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```
(This correctly computes bounding box height/width from positions; helpful for normalization and placement sizing.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (The full function from the code is partially helpful for origin translation and basic rotation/flip, but broken in rotation logic—if h > w, it rotates but then swaps h/w incorrectly, and flip condition based on bottom-half mass is heuristic but misapplies, leading to distorted shapes; salvage the translation parts but rewrite rotation/flip.)
```
(Partially helpful for translation to (0,0) and bounding box calc, but the rotation (if h>w, rotate to landscape then flip vertically?) and flip (bottom-right > bottom-left mass) are flawed and cause mismatches; do not reuse as-is, but adapt the min_r/min_c normalization.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 for train1, 3 for train2) and extracts components via flood fill, skipping small ones (>=4 cells), which worked for finding main shapes but may be too strict.
 * Normalization attempts to standardize orientation (rotate if tall, flip if asymmetric) but fails: for train1, the 8-shape is rotated/flipped into a 4x4 block instead of expected 4-high x 4-wide with cutout; 1-shape becomes 2x2 but misplaced; 3-shape distorted to 2-high x 6-wide but wrong alignment.
 * Placement sorts shapes by min row (vertical order), then concatenates horizontally with no gaps, adds borders, and pads to square—but over-pads (e.g., train1 becomes 14x14 instead of 12x12, with shapes centered wrongly in rows 6-9 instead of rows 3-10 top-aligned); for train2, shapes are crammed into rows 12-16 with huge background overhead (28x28 vs expected ~20x20), and order wrong (1's,5's,4's,6's misplaced relative to expected vertical-ish but horizontal arrangement).
 * Train1 generated: Shapes horizontally concatenated but normalized wrongly (8's too blocky/wide, 1's shifted right, 3's bottom-heavy flip failed), dimensions oversized with borders, shapes in middle rows 6-9 with top/bottom all-bg rows; expected: 12x12, shapes top-aligned in rows 3-10, 8's left (4w), then 1's (2w), then 3's (6w max), with precise cutouts (e.g., 8's have 2-wide bottom).
 * Train2 generated: All-bg top 11 rows, shapes in 12-16 (1's left, then 5's/4's/6's distorted/wrong widths), bottom all-bg; expected: More compact ~20x20, shapes in scattered rows (e.g., 4's mid-right rows 3-8, 6's lower rows 11-16, 1's bottom rows 19-26, 5's integrated), horizontal but with vertical spacing preserved? Wait, expected seems to rearrange in appearance order horizontally per "section" but code linearizes wrongly.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken (rotation swaps h/w but positions list incorrectly, flip miscalculates mass leading to upside-down or mirrored shapes); do not use as-is.
 * Overall, component extraction essential and works, but sorting/placement/padding logic misses top-alignment, exact widths, and minimal sizing; unknown why train2 expected has shapes not strictly horizontal (e.g., 1's at bottom, 5's overlapping sections)—may need order by first appearance x-then-y, not just y.
 * Test output generated: A massive ~32x48 grid (way oversized from over-padding/squaring), mostly all 4's (bg), with shapes only in rows 18-20 (8's left long block, then 3's/5's/9's/6's concatenated but distorted: 8's 3-high x10-wide instead of structured, 9's 3-high x9-wide blocky, 6's trailing); this does not look correct—expected should be compact square (maybe 20x20+), shapes normalized and top-aligned horizontally in order of appearance (likely 8,3,5,9,6 from positions), preserving cutouts (e.g., 8's probably L or irregular, not solid; 9's stepped, 6's bar-like), with 1-cell borders and centered padding if needed, not this huge empty expanse; differences: wrong dims/shape integrity/placement, shapes merged/distorted without gaps but wrong orientations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it is an oversized rectangular-then-squared grid (~32 rows x 48 cols, padded to square?) with excessive background, shapes only in a narrow band (rows 18-20), and visible distortions (e.g., 8's as solid 10-wide bar instead of expected irregular form with holes/cutouts, 9's blocky without steps, overall not top-aligned or compact).
 * The test output is missing proper normalization (no rotation/flip to standard, leading to raw concatenated widths totaling ~40+), exact shape preservation (flood fill captures but transforms break structure), and minimal sizing (should be ~22x22 bordered square based on max h~8-10, total w~30-40, pad to square).
 * Make sure to account for multiple asymmetric shapes (e.g., 3's small, 5's/6's medium, 9's large stepped, 8's complex) by improving flip/rotate heuristics and sorting by scan order (row-major left-to-right-top-to-bottom) to handle test case; unknown why generated is so vertically centered with huge top/bottom bg, but likely from code's +2 borders then aggressive squaring without trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting connected components (blobs) of the same non-background color from an input grid, filtering out small ones (less than 4 cells), normalizing their positions to a local origin, optionally rotating them to prefer landscape orientation, sorting them by their original top-left positions, and then reassembling them into a new compact grid with a background border and padding to a square shape. The goal is to create a "catalog" or standardized rendering of the extracted shapes while preserving their identities and relative ordering, but the current approach fails in arrangement, leading to mismatched layouts compared to expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color (or 0 if none); all other colors are treated as foreground for components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and same-color; only extract those with >=4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalize each component by translating positions relative to its min_r and min_c, compute its bounding box height (h) and width (w).
 * Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if h > w (tall shapes) to make them wider, updating positions as (c, h-1-r); this prefers horizontal/landscape shapes but may alter visual orientation subtly.
 * Sort extracted shapes by original (min_r, min_c) to process in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, mimicking reading order.
 * Arrangement is critical: current horizontal side-by-side placement creates a thin strip, but expected outputs suggest a more grid-like or vertically stacked layout that preserves relative vertical positioning (e.g., top shapes above bottom ones, with horizontal alignment within rows).
 * Add a 1-cell border of background around the inner arrangement, then pad the entire grid to the nearest square (max dimension) with background, centering the content.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs have consistent sizing (e.g., 12x12 for training 1, 20x20 for training 2), implying the inner arrangement's max_h and total_w determine the final side length after border (+2) and padding.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may overlap or align in the new grid based on original relative positions, but current code ignores vertical offsets and packs everything into one row; also, rotation may misalign shapes if the puzzle expects no rotation or different rotation logic.
 * Handle empty grids or no valid components by returning a single background cell.
 * Outputs use lists of lists, with rows as lists of ints; ensure deep copies to avoid mutation.
 * Potential edge: Shapes with irregular bounding boxes (e.g., L-shapes) must fill their relative positions correctly without gaps in the new grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common non-zero color; useful for distinguishing foreground.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This performs standard 4-connected flood fill for same-color components; essential for extracting blobs accurately.)

```python
def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts and filters components >=4 cells, with min_r/min_c for sorting; core to identifying valid shapes, but note it skips background cells correctly.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    relative = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]
    h = max(r for r, _ in relative) + 1
    w = max(c for _, c in relative) + 1
    return relative, h, w
```
(This normalizes shape positions to (0,0) origin and computes tight bounding box; helpful for isolating shapes.)

```python
def rotate_if_tall(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if h <= w:
        return positions, h, w
    new_positions = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]
    new_h = w
    new_w = h
    return new_positions, new_h, new_w
```
(This rotates tall shapes to landscape; useful but may be a subtlety—puzzle might not require rotation, or it could be causing mismatches in shape orientation.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    new_h = gh + 2
    new_w = gw + 2
    new_grid = [[bg] * new_w for _ in range(new_h)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This adds a 1-cell background border; correct and necessary for framing.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    side = max(gh, gw)
    if gh == 0 or gw == 0:
        return [[bg]]
    if side == gh == gw:
        return [row[:] for row in grid]  # copy
    new_grid = [[bg] * side for _ in range(side)]
    offset_r = (side - gh) // 2
    offset_c = (side - gw) // 2
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[offset_r + i][offset_c + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This centers and pads to square with background; works well but amplifies issues if inner grid is imbalanced.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters components (>=4 cells), normalizes positions, and applies optional rotation, but fails in sorting and arrangement: shapes are sorted by (min_r, min_c) but placed horizontally side-by-side in a single row, creating a thin inner grid (e.g., height ~2-4, wide total_w), leading to many empty rows after bordering and square-padding.
 * For training example 1: Generated a 14x14 grid with all shapes crammed into rows 5-8 (8's left, 1's middle, 3's right, but misaligned and no vertical separation), surrounded by 2's border and top/bottom padding; expected is 12x12 with 8's top-left (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1's top-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9), 3's bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 8-13, horizontal), preserving vertical ordering and compactness—generated mismatches by flattening to one row and oversized padding.
 * For training example 2: Generated a 28x28 grid (way oversized) with 10+ empty rows top/bottom, shapes crammed into rows 11-16 (1's left, 5's scattered, 4's/6's middle-right, but jumbled and no grid structure); expected is 20x20 with shapes in a multi-row layout (4's/5's top-middle rows 2-7, 6's middle rows 10-15, 1's bottom rows 18-25, with vertical stacking and horizontal alignment within "rows" of shapes)—generated differs by horizontal packing, wrong size, and poor alignment (e.g., 1's and 5's fragmented).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order but doesn't account for vertical grouping; build_inner_grid is broken for multi-row arrangements—needs to place shapes in rows based on original min_r buckets or similar.
 * Rotation may be unhelpful or incorrect: e.g., in training 1, 3's is horizontal in expected but might be rotated if tall; don't use if it distorts expected shapes.
 * Flood_fill and extract_raw_components are essential and correct for component detection; translate_to_origin is helpful for normalization.
 * add_border and pad_to_square are correct but highlight arrangement flaws (e.g., thin inner -> empty square).
 * Overall, extraction works (shapes identified correctly), but rearrangement doesn't mimic the expected "poster" or "inventory" layout with vertical stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it's a massive ~48x48? grid (inferred from 48 elements per row) mostly filled with background 4's (empty rows 0-16 and 20-47), with shapes crammed into only rows 17-19 (8's left spanning multiple rows but flattened, 3's/5's/9's/6's jumbled horizontally without vertical separation or alignment, e.g., 8's block rows 17-19 cols 1-9, then scattered smaller blobs like 3's at cols 10-12, 5's at 13-21, etc., ending with 6's right).
 * It differs from what we'd expect (based on training): should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with extracted shapes (8,3,5,9,6 colors visible) arranged in a multi-row grid layout (e.g., larger 8's block top, smaller ones below/right, bordered by 4's, centered), preserving relative original positions vertically; instead, horizontal cramming creates imbalance, no stacking (all in 3 rows), and excessive empty space, suggesting the same arrangement bug as training examples.
 * Shapes seem extracted correctly (e.g., large 8's, 9's block, 6's), but placement ignores vertical offsets—e.g., if test has vertically separated shapes, they should stack, not inline; rotation might have flipped some (unknown if needed).
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too sparse/empty, mismatched size, no visual "catalog" structure; likely fails if test expects similar to training 2's stacked layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements/properties across **both** train examples (train input 1 ↔ output 1, and train input 2 ↔ output 2). These are limited to patterns that appear identically in every case, without speculation, high-level interpretation, or attempts to explain mechanisms. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., text labels, standalone small squares without clear ties, or one-off positions) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact rules for repositioning) are explicitly noted as such. No connections are forced if not evident in the data.

#### 1. **Single-Pixel Red Elements (Dark Red, Maroon, or Red with pixels=1, holes=0) → Removal**
   - **Description**: These are scattered single-pixel markers (bbox typically 1x1, e.g., [x,y,x,y]) in red variants.
   - **Interaction**: Consistently present in all inputs (8 in train 1, 8 in train 2). Completely absent in all outputs. No preservation of position, color, or count.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every puzzle; they do not interact with or transfer to any other specific component (e.g., no clear absorption into shapes). Possible role as temporary connectors or modifiers, but transformation details unknown.
   - **Affected Properties**: Position (irrelevant post-removal), color (red variants), pixels (always 1), holes (always 0).

#### 2. **Holed Shape (Any Color with holes >0) → Pixel Count Multiplication and Bbox Expansion**
   - **Description**: Exactly one shape per input has holes >0 (Red with holes=3, pixels=28 in train 1; Green with holes=5, pixels=121 in train 2). These are larger polyominoes (pixels >20, bbox spanning multiple grid units).
   - **Interaction**: Pixel count is consistently multiplied by 4 (28 → 112 in train 1; 121 → 484 in train 2). Holes count preserved exactly (3 → 3; 5 → 5). Bbox expands significantly in both dimensions (e.g., [0,0,5,5] → [0,0,11,11] in train 1; [20,0,29,13] → [0,0,19,27] in train 2), often shifting position (e.g., to top-left origin). Color preserved (Red → Red; Green → Green).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every puzzle for the single holed shape; no other shapes exhibit this. No interaction with single red pixels evident (e.g., pixel increase not tied to red count: 84 added in train 1 vs. 363 in train 2, despite similar red counts).
   - **Affected Properties**: Holes count → triggers transformation; pixels → scaled by fixed factor (4); bbox (position and size) → expanded/relocated; color → unchanged.
   - **Unknown**: Exact expansion logic (e.g., how bbox dimensions are calculated beyond scaling).

#### 3. **Non-Holed Polyomino Shapes (Colors like Blue, Green, Maroon, Orange, Pink, Yellow with holes=0, pixels ≥4) → Pixel Preservation and Bbox Repositioning**
   - **Description**: Multiple polyomino shapes per input (e.g., Blue pixels=4, Maroon=12, Green=16 in train 1; Blue=24, Green=121 [but holed, so excluded here], Yellow=24, Pink=20, Orange=4 in train 2).
   - **Interaction**: Pixel count preserved exactly (e.g., 4→4, 12→12, 16→16 in train 1; 24→24, 20→20, 4→4 in train 2). Holes remain 0. Color preserved. Bbox changes position and sometimes size/aspect (e.g., Blue [2,10,3,11] → [8,2,9,3] in train 1; Yellow [11,8,18,13] → [10,2,17,7] in train 2), but no pixel scaling.
   - **Consistency**: Applies to all non-holed shapes in every puzzle; holed shapes follow rule #2 instead. No merging or splitting observed.
   - **Affected Properties**: Pixels → unchanged; color → unchanged; holes → unchanged (0); bbox (position/size) → transformed.
   - **Unknown**: Repositioning logic (e.g., no consistent position-to-position mapping, such as relative to reds or other shapes; appears irregular).

#### 4. **Background Color → Change to Red**
   - **Description**: Implicit neutral black background in inputs; explicit solid red framing/composition in outputs.
   - **Interaction**: Consistently shifts from black (input) to red (output). No pixel or bbox data for background itself, but it frames all output shapes.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every puzzle; may interact with expanded holed shape (e.g., output bbox often starts at [0,0] aligning with red background), but no direct tie to other elements.
   - **Affected Properties**: Color → black → red.
   - **Unknown**: Whether background absorbs/interacts with removed red pixels or expanded shape (no data confirms).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no reliable color-to-color transfers, hole count influencing non-holed shapes, or position-based effects like "proximity to red → movement" that hold across both examples). Elements like potential text/semantic labels or standalone small squares (e.g., pixels=4 blocks) do not show clear, consistent ties in the blob data and are excluded.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 02:15:29] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify the background color, extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors that meet a minimum size threshold, normalize each shape's orientation and position through translations, rotations, and flips to standardize their appearance (e.g., making them "bottom-left justified" based on weight distribution), and then rearrange these normalized shapes into a new compact grid arranged horizontally in the order they appear in the original grid (sorted by top-left position), with added borders and padding to form a square output grid while preserving the original colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most frequent non-zero color as background; ignore zeros and treat them as empty/transparent, but ensure extraction skips background entirely.
 * Shape extraction: Only consider 4-connected (up/down/left/right) components of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise should be omitted. Sort extracted shapes by their minimum row (topmost position), then by minimum column (leftmost within same row) to preserve reading order (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom in original grid).
 * Normalization subtleties: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. If height > width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise to prefer landscape orientation, then re-translate. For vertical flip: Divide bounding box height in half; if bottom half has equal or more cells than top half, flip vertically (upside-down) and re-translate—this prefers "upright" or balanced shapes but can invert if bottom-heavy. For horizontal flip: In the bottom half, if more cells are on the right than left, flip horizontally (mirror left-right) and re-translate—this prefers left-heavy bottoms. Recalculate bounding box after each transformation. These flips/rotations can subtly change how shapes "face" or align, and equal-weight cases flip vertical (which might not always be desired if the puzzle expects "as-is" for balanced shapes).
 * Arrangement: Place normalized shapes side-by-side horizontally in a row, with 1-cell gaps between them (but no leading gap for the first). Use the max height across all shapes for the row height; widths add up with gaps. This creates a rectangular inner grid.
 * Border and padding: Add a thin border (size 1 in this attempt, but expected seems to use size 2 or variable) of background color around the inner grid. Then pad the entire bordered grid to a square by centering it in a larger grid of side length equal to max(outer_height, outer_width), filling extras with background—this ensures square output but can lead to oversized grids if inner arrangement is too wide/tall.
 * Grid sizing issues: Outputs must match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected 12x12, but generated 16x16; train2 expected ~20x28? but generated 32x32). Avoid over-padding or assuming fixed sizes; calculate minimally. Preserve exact cell counts and positions from normalized shapes without overlap or clipping.
 * Color preservation: Keep original colors for shapes; do not change them during normalization or placement.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have uneven shapes, multiple components per color, or shapes touching borders. Zeros are not background but empty—do not treat as shapes. If no shapes, output minimal background grid. Sorting ensures order like reading a book, which might place vertically stacked shapes in input as sequential in output.
 * Potential misses: The >=4 cell threshold works but might filter too aggressively if small shapes are intended. Horizontal arrangement assumes all fit in one row; if too wide, might need multi-row or vertical stacking (not handled here). Border size is inconsistent (attempt uses 1, but expected visuals suggest 2). Flips might over-transform (e.g., equal bottom/top flips vertical, but expected might keep original orientation). Padding centers but can create uneven borders if dimensions differ oddly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it correctly identifies background via frequency and extracts components using flood fill with size filter and sorting by position, which isolates main shapes in order.
 * Normalization functions (translate, bounding box, heaviness checks, flips, rotate) are conceptually helpful for standardizing shapes but produce incorrect orientations/flips in outputs (e.g., shapes appear inverted or mirrored compared to expected, possibly due to flipping on equal weights or unnecessary rotations).
 * Horizontal arrangement with gaps works in theory but fails in practice: shapes are placed but with wrong spacing (no gaps in some expected), leading to oversized inner grids; train1 places only partial/wrong shapes (e.g., only 3's visible, missing 8/1), train2 crams multiple shapes into one area without proper separation.
 * Border addition (size 1) and padding to square are implemented but wrong: uses border=1 (expected visuals suggest 2), and padding over-expands (e.g., train1 to 16x16 vs expected 12x12; train2 to 32x32 vs ~20x28; test to ~50x50 vs likely smaller compact square), centering but creating too much empty space.
 * arrange_shapes_horizontal adds +1 gaps between shapes (including after last?), inflating width unnecessarily—expected has tighter packing without consistent gaps.
 * place_shape is basic and correct for overlaying but clips if out-of-bounds (not an issue here).
 * Overall, extraction and normalization are partially working (shapes are detected), but transformation rules are too aggressive/subtle mismatches (e.g., unknown why train1 only shows 3's, perhaps extraction missed colors or sorting failed); arrangement/bordering/padding bloat the grid size and misplace elements.
 * Function add_border is helpful but needs adjustable size (try 2); pad_to_max_dimension is relevant but over-pads—consider minimal square without centering if not needed.
 * Functions like count_cells_in_half, is_bottom_heavy, flip_vertical, count_bottom_left_right, is_bottom_right_heavy, flip_horizontal are tied to normalization and provide weight-based decisions, but may be overkill or incorrect for puzzle (e.g., expected shapes seem unrotated/unflipped in train1/2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an enormously oversized ~50x50 grid (way larger than needed) filled almost entirely with background 4's, with shapes (6,9,8,5) crammed into the bottom rows (rows 20-29) in a dense, non-arranged cluster without horizontal spacing, borders, or proper padding/centering—expected should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with shapes arranged horizontally in sorted order, thin borders, and minimal padding, preserving distinct separated positions like in training examples.
 * Shapes appear partially normalized (e.g., 9's in a block, 6's extended, 8/5 adjacent) but not translated/rotated/flipped correctly, and placement ignores order/sorting, leading to overlap or wrong adjacency; no visible borders, and excessive empty space above suggests failed inner grid calculation or padding explosion.
 * This highlights the same issues as training: over-sized output from bad arrangement + padding, incomplete shape extraction/placement (possibly missed some components or colors), and normalization not matching expected orientations (e.g., if test has tall shapes, rotation might have failed silently).

[2025-10-01 02:15:38] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on consistent patterns across both train inputs and outputs, the following interconnections are evident. These are limited to properties or components that show clear, repeated interactions (e.g., preservation, transformation triggers, or mutual effects) in every example. Only elements with consistent behavior are included; irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated single-pixel reds without effect, text overlays) are excluded. Unexplained aspects of transformations are noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Holed Shapes (holes > 0) and Background Formation**
   - **Components involved**: The single shape with holes > 0 (Red in Train 1 input; Green in Train 2 input).
   - **Interconnections**:
     - Color of holed shape → Output background color (Red background in Train 1 output; Green background in Train 2 output).
     - Hole count of holed shape → Hole count of output background (holes=3 preserved in Train 1; holes=5 preserved in Train 2).
     - Bounding box (bbox) of holed shape → Expanded bbox in output background (input bbox small/partial → output bbox covers full output area [0,0 to max dimensions]; expansion mechanism unknown).
     - Pixel count of holed shape → Increased pixel count in output background (Train 1: 28 → 112; Train 2: 121 → 484; increase consistent but scaling factor unknown, possibly affected by total output size or other shapes' placement).
   - **Effect on other components**: This background interacts with all preserved non-holed shapes by serving as the field they are placed upon (all outputs show non-background shapes positioned within or overlapping the background bbox).

#### 2. **Non-Holed Large Shapes (holes=0, pixels > 10) Preservation and Placement**
   - **Components involved**: Multi-pixel shapes excluding the holed one and single pixels (e.g., Maroon, Blue, Green in Train 1; Orange, Blue, Yellow, Pink, Green [non-holed instances] in Train 2).
   - **Interconnections**:
     - Color → Preserved exactly in output (e.g., Maroon remains Maroon; Blue remains Blue across both trains).
     - Pixel count → Preserved exactly in output (e.g., Train 1: Maroon=12, Blue=4, Green=16 all unchanged; Train 2: Orange=4, Blue=24, Yellow=24, Pink=20 all unchanged).
     - Hole count → Remains 0 in output (consistent preservation).
     - Bounding box (bbox) → Repositioned/possibly resized in output (e.g., Train 1 Blue [2,10,3,11] → [8,2,9,3]; Train 2 Yellow [11,8,18,13] → [10,2,17,7]; new positions consistent but transformation rule unknown, possibly influenced by background bbox or relative input positions).
   - **Effect from other components**: Placement appears affected by the background (all preserved shapes' output bboxes are subsets of or adjacent to the background bbox), but exact interaction (e.g., avoidance of holes) unknown.

#### 3. **Single-Pixel Components (holes=0, pixels=1, red variants: Dark Red, Maroon, Red)**
   - **Components involved**: Scattered single-pixel red-like elements (multiple in both Train 1 and Train 2 inputs).
   - **Interconnections**:
     - Presence → Absence in output (all removed consistently; no preservation of color, pixels, or bbox).
     - Possible effect on background: Their total pixels may contribute to background pixel increase (Train 1: ~10 single pixels → background +84 pixels; Train 2: ~6 single pixels → background +363 pixels), but contribution mechanism unknown and not definitively consistent without exact counting.
   - **Effect on other components**: No direct interaction with preserved shapes (no color/position changes tied to them); treated as non-interacting noise.

#### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **Inconsistent or irrelevant elements**: Text overlays (e.g., "H.4", "T.R." in yellow blocks) appear only in inputs and are absent in outputs consistently, but show no interaction (e.g., no effect on color, pixels, or position of yellow shapes). Small non-single-pixel reds (e.g., pixels=2-3 in Test Input 1) are not present in trains, so no consistent interaction identifiable. New colors (e.g., Light Blue, Pink in Test) assumed to follow non-holed preservation if large, but unverified.
- **Unknown transformations**: Specific rules for bbox repositioning/scaling (e.g., how input positions map to output) and background pixel increase (e.g., fill algorithm) are consistent in occurrence but unexplained from data. No forced connections (e.g., no assumed shape semantics like tetromino types affecting holes, as not consistent across examples). No high-level puzzle logic inferred.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 02:16:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify the background color, extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors that meet a minimum size threshold, normalize each shape's orientation and position through translations, rotations, and flips to standardize their appearance (e.g., making them "bottom-left justified" based on weight distribution), and then rearrange these normalized shapes into a new compact grid arranged horizontally in the order they appear in the original grid (sorted by top-left position), with added borders and padding to form a square output grid while preserving the original colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most frequent non-zero color as background; ignore zeros and treat them as empty/transparent, but ensure extraction skips background entirely.
 * Shape extraction: Only consider 4-connected (up/down/left/right) components of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise should be omitted. Sort extracted shapes by their minimum row (topmost position), then by minimum column (leftmost within same row) to preserve reading order (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom in original grid).
 * Normalization subtleties: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. If height > width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise to prefer landscape orientation, then re-translate. For vertical flip: Divide bounding box height in half; if bottom half has equal or more cells than top half, flip vertically (upside-down) and re-translate—this prefers "upright" or balanced shapes but can invert if bottom-heavy. For horizontal flip: In the bottom half, if more cells are on the right than left, flip horizontally (mirror left-right) and re-translate—this prefers left-heavy bottoms. Recalculate bounding box after each transformation. These flips/rotations can subtly change how shapes "face" or align, and equal-weight cases flip vertical (which might not always be desired if the puzzle expects "as-is" for balanced shapes).
 * Arrangement: Place normalized shapes side-by-side horizontally in a row, with 1-cell gaps between them (but no leading gap for the first). Use the max height across all shapes for the row height; widths add up with gaps. This creates a rectangular inner grid.
 * Border and padding: Add a thin border (size 1 in this attempt, but expected seems to use size 2 or variable) of background color around the inner grid. Then pad the entire bordered grid to a square by centering it in a larger grid of side length equal to max(outer_height, outer_width), filling extras with background—this ensures square output but can lead to oversized grids if inner arrangement is too wide/tall.
 * Grid sizing issues: Outputs must match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected 12x12, but generated 16x16; train2 expected ~20x28? but generated 32x32). Avoid over-padding or assuming fixed sizes; calculate minimally. Preserve exact cell counts and positions from normalized shapes without overlap or clipping.
 * Color preservation: Keep original colors for shapes; do not change them during normalization or placement.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have uneven shapes, multiple components per color, or shapes touching borders. Zeros are not background but empty—do not treat as shapes. If no shapes, output minimal background grid. Sorting ensures order like reading a book, which might place vertically stacked shapes in input as sequential in output.
 * Potential misses: The >=4 cell threshold works but might filter too aggressively if small shapes are intended. Horizontal arrangement assumes all fit in one row; if too wide, might need multi-row or vertical stacking (not handled here). Border size is inconsistent (attempt uses 1, but expected visuals suggest 2). Flips might over-transform (e.g., equal bottom/top flips vertical, but expected might keep original orientation). Padding centers but can create uneven borders if dimensions differ oddly.

    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1

    # Full normalization pipeline: translate, rotate if tall, vertical flip if bottom-heavy (incl. equal), horizontal flip if bottom-right heavy—attempts to standardize but may over-flip based on puzzle needs.
    positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    if h > w:
        positions = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]  # 90 deg rotate
        h, w = w, h
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it correctly identifies background via frequency and extracts components using flood fill with size filter and sorting by position, which isolates main shapes in order.
 * Normalization functions (translate, bounding box, heaviness checks, flips, rotate) are conceptually helpful for standardizing shapes but produce incorrect orientations/flips in outputs (e.g., shapes appear inverted or mirrored compared to expected, possibly due to flipping on equal weights or unnecessary rotations).
 * Horizontal arrangement with gaps works in theory but fails in practice: shapes are placed but with wrong spacing (no gaps in some expected), leading to oversized inner grids; train1 places only partial/wrong shapes (e.g., only 3's visible, missing 8/1), train2 crams multiple shapes into one area without proper separation.
 * Border addition (size 1) and padding to square are implemented but wrong: uses border=1 (expected visuals suggest 2), and padding over-expands (e.g., train1 to 16x16 vs expected 12x12; train2 to 32x32 vs ~20x28; test to ~50x50 vs likely smaller compact square), centering but creating too much empty space.
 * arrange_shapes_horizontal adds +1 gaps between shapes (including after last?), inflating width unnecessarily—expected has tighter packing without consistent gaps.
 * place_shape is basic and correct for overlaying but clips if out-of-bounds (not an issue here).
 * Overall, extraction and normalization are partially working (shapes are detected), but transformation rules are too aggressive/subtle mismatches (e.g., unknown why train1 only shows 3's, perhaps extraction missed colors or sorting failed); arrangement/bordering/padding bloat the grid size and misplace elements.
 * Function add_border is helpful but needs adjustable size (try 2); pad_to_max_dimension is relevant but over-pads—consider minimal square without centering if not needed.
 * Functions like count_cells_in_half, is_bottom_heavy, flip_vertical, count_bottom_left_right, is_bottom_right_heavy, flip_horizontal are tied to normalization and provide weight-based decisions, but may be overkill or incorrect for puzzle (e.g., expected shapes seem unrotated/unflipped in train1/2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an enormously oversized ~50x50 grid (way larger than needed) filled almost entirely with background 4's, with shapes (6,9,8,5) crammed into the bottom rows (rows 20-29) in a dense, non-arranged cluster without horizontal spacing, borders, or proper padding/centering—expected should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with shapes arranged horizontally in sorted order, thin borders, and minimal padding, preserving distinct separated positions like in training examples.
 * Shapes appear partially normalized (e.g., 9's in a block, 6's extended, 8/5 adjacent) but not translated/rotated/flipped correctly, and placement ignores order/sorting, leading to overlap or wrong adjacency; no visible borders, and excessive empty space above suggests failed inner grid calculation or padding explosion.
 * This highlights the same issues as training: over-sized output from bad arrangement + padding, incomplete shape extraction/placement (possibly missed some components or colors), and normalization not matching expected orientations (e.g., if test has tall shapes, rotation might have failed silently).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 possibly empty but backgrounds are non-zero), and the goal is to identify distinct connected shapes (blobs of the same color, excluding the background), normalize their positions and orientations to a standard form, and rearrange them into a new larger grid framed by the background color, with shapes placed in a specific spatial layout (e.g., horizontally adjacent or in rows/columns based on original positions) rather than simply stacked.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other colors represent potential shapes, but only connected components (4-connected, via flood fill) of size >=4 cells are considered "main shapes"—smaller blobs are ignored.
 * Shapes must be extracted per color, taking the largest component per color if multiple exist (as in the code's components_by_color logic).
 * Normalization involves translating the shape to (0,0) top-left, then optionally rotating 90 degrees clockwise if height >= width (to prefer wider orientations?), checking for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top half) and flipping vertically if so, then trimming empty space from top/left to re-minimize bounding box— this seems partially correct but may over-rotate or flip in ways that distort shapes relative to expected outputs.
 * Arrangement is key: the code stacks shapes vertically into a square inner canvas (summing heights, max width, padding to square), then adds a 1-cell border, but expected outputs place shapes horizontally adjacent (e.g., in example 1, 8's left, 1's middle-right, 3's bottom-right; in example 2, shapes like 4's and 6's are split across rows/columns), suggesting sorting by original min row position and placing side-by-side or in a grid layout to fit within a bordered frame matching input dimensions or expanded minimally.
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by min row of positions, which is good for vertical order, but expected seems to preserve horizontal relationships or place in original relative positions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs expand the grid (e.g., example 1 input likely 10x10 becomes 12x12 framed), with empty space filled by background; shapes don't overlap and are not rotated/flipped in ways that change their relative "up" direction—code's bottom-heavy flip may be unnecessary or wrongly applied.
 * Handle empty/whitespace: Grids may have irregular shapes; ensure no overwriting during placement.
 * Colors: Preserve original colors; background frames everything.
 * Edge cases: Multiple components per color (take largest); no shapes (return minimal bg grid); varying input sizes.
 * Puzzle rules imply preserving shape integrity—no scaling, just translation/rotation/flip for canonical form, then precise placement to match a "composed" image where shapes are juxtaposed as if "cut out" and reassembled in a new composition.

                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the most common non-zero as bg, useful for framing and exclusion.)

                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components per color.)

```python
def extract_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components_by_color = {}
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                size = len(component)
                if size >= 4:
                    if color not in components_by_color or size > len(components_by_color[color][1]):
                        components_by_color[color] = (color, component)
    shapes = list(components_by_color.values())
    shapes.sort(key=lambda x: min(pr for pr, pc in x[1]))
    return shapes
```
(This is helpful for identifying and sorting largest shapes by min row, but may need adjustment to handle multiple per color or different sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2) and extracts main shapes via flood fill, ignoring small components and bg— this worked for finding the right colors and rough positions.
 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors in an input grid, normalize their positions, orientations, and shapes to a standard form (e.g., top-left aligned, possibly rotated or flipped for consistency), and then rearrange them horizontally side-by-side in a new output grid filled with the background color, ensuring the overall output is a square grid with optional bordering padding while preserving the relative internal structure of each shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the dominant color in the grid (most frequent non-zero value), but it may surround shapes or fill large areas; do not treat zero as background unless specified, and ensure shapes are only extracted if they are connected components of the same color with at least a minimum size (e.g., >=4 cells in the code, but this threshold may be arbitrary or unnecessary).
 * Shapes must be extracted via flood fill on connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right), ignoring background and other colors; small or isolated cells (<4) are skipped, which worked but may over-filter if shapes are small.
 * Normalization is crucial: translate shapes to (0,0) origin (min row/col = 0), determine bounding box height/width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise if height > width to make them landscape-oriented, flip horizontally if the bottom half has more mass on the right than left (to standardize "facing" or asymmetry), and re-normalize origin after transformations; this attempts to canonicalize shapes but fails in examples due to incorrect rotation/flipping logic (e.g., over-rotates or flips asymmetrically, leading to distorted placements).
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by minimum row position in original grid (top-to-bottom order of first appearance), which may be correct for reading order but doesn't match expected horizontal left-to-right arrangement in outputs.
 * Placement: Shapes are placed side-by-side horizontally in rows, aligned to the top of the output grid, with their normalized widths added cumulatively; add 1-cell borders top/bottom/left/right around the entire arrangement, then pad to make the output square by adding background rows/columns centered (e.g., if wider than tall, add rows in the middle); total output size should match the minimal square enclosing the bordered arrangement, but code over-pads massively (e.g., +2 borders then squaring leads to oversized grids).
 * Subtleties: Preserve exact relative positions within each shape (no stretching/compression); do not merge shapes or alter colors; output must exactly match expected dimensions and cell values, including background fills; in examples, shapes are abutted directly without gaps between them, but bordered overall; rotations/flips must ensure shapes "face" consistently (e.g., bottom-heavy or asymmetric shapes flipped to standardize); minimum shape size (>=4) skips noise but may miss valid small shapes; background identification counts only non-zero, but if all zero, defaults to 0—ensure it doesn't misidentify shapes as background.
 * Edge cases: Grids with no shapes return single background cell; varying shape sizes require dynamic max height for vertical alignment; if arrangement is taller than wide post-border, pad columns centered; test input has multiple shapes (colors 8,3,5,9,6?) that need sequential horizontal placement without distortion.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid re-processing; use deque for BFS efficiency; counter for background via frequency; handle empty grids; sorting by y-position assumes vertical scanning order, but examples suggest left-to-right or appearance order; final squaring pads symmetrically but code's half = extra//2 may off-center if odd; generated outputs show shapes concatenated horizontally but with wrong normalization (e.g., 8's block is too wide/tall, 1's misplaced), leading to non-matching dimensions (14x14 vs expected 12x12 for train1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This works well for finding the most frequent non-background color as bg, but may need adjustment if bg is zero or sparse.)

                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component

(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of the same color, avoiding background and other shapes; use it in future attempts.)

def get_h_w(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in positions)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```
(This correctly computes bounding box height/width from positions; helpful for normalization and placement sizing.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (The full function from the code is partially helpful for origin translation and basic rotation/flip, but broken in rotation logic—if h > w, it rotates but then swaps h/w incorrectly, and flip condition based on bottom-half mass is heuristic but misapplies, leading to distorted shapes; salvage the translation parts but rewrite rotation/flip.)
```
(Partially helpful for translation to (0,0) and bounding box calc, but the rotation (if h>w, rotate to landscape then flip vertically?) and flip (bottom-right > bottom-left mass) are flawed and cause mismatches; do not reuse as-is, but adapt the min_r/min_c normalization.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 for train1, 3 for train2) and extracts components via flood fill, skipping small ones (>=4 cells), which worked for finding main shapes but may be too strict.
 * Normalization attempts to standardize orientation (rotate if tall, flip if asymmetric) but fails: for train1, the 8-shape is rotated/flipped into a 4x4 block instead of expected 4-high x 4-wide with cutout; 1-shape becomes 2x2 but misplaced; 3-shape distorted to 2-high x 6-wide but wrong alignment.
 * Placement sorts shapes by min row (vertical order), then concatenates horizontally with no gaps, adds borders, and pads to square—but over-pads (e.g., train1 becomes 14x14 instead of 12x12, with shapes centered wrongly in rows 6-9 instead of rows 3-10 top-aligned); for train2, shapes are crammed into rows 12-16 with huge background overhead (28x28 vs expected ~20x20), and order wrong (1's,5's,4's,6's misplaced relative to expected vertical-ish but horizontal arrangement).
 * Train1 generated: Shapes horizontally concatenated but normalized wrongly (8's too blocky/wide, 1's shifted right, 3's bottom-heavy flip failed), dimensions oversized with borders, shapes in middle rows 6-9 with top/bottom all-bg rows; expected: 12x12, shapes top-aligned in rows 3-10, 8's left (4w), then 1's (2w), then 3's (6w max), with precise cutouts (e.g., 8's have 2-wide bottom).
 * Train2 generated: All-bg top 11 rows, shapes in 12-16 (1's left, then 5's/4's/6's distorted/wrong widths), bottom all-bg; expected: More compact ~20x20, shapes in scattered rows (e.g., 4's mid-right rows 3-8, 6's lower rows 11-16, 1's bottom rows 19-26, 5's integrated), horizontal but with vertical spacing preserved? Wait, expected seems to rearrange in appearance order horizontally per "section" but code linearizes wrongly.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken (rotation swaps h/w but positions list incorrectly, flip miscalculates mass leading to upside-down or mirrored shapes); do not use as-is.
 * Overall, component extraction essential and works, but sorting/placement/padding logic misses top-alignment, exact widths, and minimal sizing; unknown why train2 expected has shapes not strictly horizontal (e.g., 1's at bottom, 5's overlapping sections)—may need order by first appearance x-then-y, not just y.
 * Test output generated: A massive ~32x48 grid (way oversized from over-padding/squaring), mostly all 4's (bg), with shapes only in rows 18-20 (8's left long block, then 3's/5's/9's/6's concatenated but distorted: 8's 3-high x10-wide instead of structured, 9's 3-high x9-wide blocky, 6's trailing); this does not look correct—expected should be compact square (maybe 20x20+), shapes normalized and top-aligned horizontally in order of appearance (likely 8,3,5,9,6 from positions), preserving cutouts (e.g., 8's probably L or irregular, not solid; 9's stepped, 6's bar-like), with 1-cell borders and centered padding if needed, not this huge empty expanse; differences: wrong dims/shape integrity/placement, shapes merged/distorted without gaps but wrong orientations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it is an oversized rectangular-then-squared grid (~32 rows x 48 cols, padded to square?) with excessive background, shapes only in a narrow band (rows 18-20), and visible distortions (e.g., 8's as solid 10-wide bar instead of expected irregular form with holes/cutouts, 9's blocky without steps, overall not top-aligned or compact).
 * The test output is missing proper normalization (no rotation/flip to standard, leading to raw concatenated widths totaling ~40+), exact shape preservation (flood fill captures but transforms break structure), and minimal sizing (should be ~22x22 bordered square based on max h~8-10, total w~30-40, pad to square).
 * Make sure to account for multiple asymmetric shapes (e.g., 3's small, 5's/6's medium, 9's large stepped, 8's complex) by improving flip/rotate heuristics and sorting by scan order (row-major left-to-right-top-to-bottom) to handle test case; unknown why generated is so vertically centered with huge top/bottom bg, but likely from code's +2 borders then aggressive squaring without trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting connected components (blobs) of the same non-background color from an input grid, filtering out small ones (less than 4 cells), normalizing their positions to a local origin, optionally rotating them to prefer landscape orientation, sorting them by their original top-left positions, and then reassembling them into a new compact grid with a background border and padding to a square shape. The goal is to create a "catalog" or standardized rendering of the extracted shapes while preserving their identities and relative ordering, but the current approach fails in arrangement, leading to mismatched layouts compared to expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color (or 0 if none); all other colors are treated as foreground for components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and same-color; only extract those with >=4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalize each component by translating positions relative to its min_r and min_c, compute its bounding box height (h) and width (w).
 * Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if h > w (tall shapes) to make them wider, updating positions as (c, h-1-r); this prefers horizontal/landscape shapes but may alter visual orientation subtly.
 * Sort extracted shapes by original (min_r, min_c) to process in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, mimicking reading order.
 * Arrangement is critical: current horizontal side-by-side placement creates a thin strip, but expected outputs suggest a more grid-like or vertically stacked layout that preserves relative vertical positioning (e.g., top shapes above bottom ones, with horizontal alignment within rows).
 * Add a 1-cell border of background around the inner arrangement, then pad the entire grid to the nearest square (max dimension) with background, centering the content.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs have consistent sizing (e.g., 12x12 for training 1, 20x20 for training 2), implying the inner arrangement's max_h and total_w determine the final side length after border (+2) and padding.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may overlap or align in the new grid based on original relative positions, but current code ignores vertical offsets and packs everything into one row; also, rotation may misalign shapes if the puzzle expects no rotation or different rotation logic.
 * Handle empty grids or no valid components by returning a single background cell.
 * Outputs use lists of lists, with rows as lists of ints; ensure deep copies to avoid mutation.
 * Potential edge: Shapes with irregular bounding boxes (e.g., L-shapes) must fill their relative positions correctly without gaps in the new grid.

def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts and filters components >=4 cells, with min_r/min_c for sorting; core to identifying valid shapes, but note it skips background cells correctly.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    relative = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]
    h = max(r for r, _ in relative) + 1
    w = max(c for _, c in relative) + 1
    return relative, h, w
```
(This normalizes shape positions to (0,0) origin and computes tight bounding box; helpful for isolating shapes.)

```python
def rotate_if_tall(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if h <= w:
        return positions, h, w
    new_positions = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]
    new_h = w
    new_w = h
    return new_positions, new_h, new_w
```
(This rotates tall shapes to landscape; useful but may be a subtlety—puzzle might not require rotation, or it could be causing mismatches in shape orientation.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    new_h = gh + 2
    new_w = gw + 2
    new_grid = [[bg] * new_w for _ in range(new_h)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This adds a 1-cell background border; correct and necessary for framing.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    side = max(gh, gw)
    if gh == 0 or gw == 0:
        return [[bg]]
    if side == gh == gw:
        return [row[:] for row in grid]  # copy
    new_grid = [[bg] * side for _ in range(side)]
    offset_r = (side - gh) // 2
    offset_c = (side - gw) // 2
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[offset_r + i][offset_c + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This centers and pads to square with background; works well but amplifies issues if inner grid is imbalanced.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters components (>=4 cells), normalizes positions, and applies optional rotation, but fails in sorting and arrangement: shapes are sorted by (min_r, min_c) but placed horizontally side-by-side in a single row, creating a thin inner grid (e.g., height ~2-4, wide total_w), leading to many empty rows after bordering and square-padding.
 * For training example 1: Generated a 14x14 grid with all shapes crammed into rows 5-8 (8's left, 1's middle, 3's right, but misaligned and no vertical separation), surrounded by 2's border and top/bottom padding; expected is 12x12 with 8's top-left (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1's top-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9), 3's bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 8-13, horizontal), preserving vertical ordering and compactness—generated mismatches by flattening to one row and oversized padding.
 * For training example 2: Generated a 28x28 grid (way oversized) with 10+ empty rows top/bottom, shapes crammed into rows 11-16 (1's left, 5's scattered, 4's/6's middle-right, but jumbled and no grid structure); expected is 20x20 with shapes in a multi-row layout (4's/5's top-middle rows 2-7, 6's middle rows 10-15, 1's bottom rows 18-25, with vertical stacking and horizontal alignment within "rows" of shapes)—generated differs by horizontal packing, wrong size, and poor alignment (e.g., 1's and 5's fragmented).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order but doesn't account for vertical grouping; build_inner_grid is broken for multi-row arrangements—needs to place shapes in rows based on original min_r buckets or similar.
 * Rotation may be unhelpful or incorrect: e.g., in training 1, 3's is horizontal in expected but might be rotated if tall; don't use if it distorts expected shapes.
 * Flood_fill and extract_raw_components are essential and correct for component detection; translate_to_origin is helpful for normalization.
 * add_border and pad_to_square are correct but highlight arrangement flaws (e.g., thin inner -> empty square).
 * Overall, extraction works (shapes identified correctly), but rearrangement doesn't mimic the expected "poster" or "inventory" layout with vertical stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it's a massive ~48x48? grid (inferred from 48 elements per row) mostly filled with background 4's (empty rows 0-16 and 20-47), with shapes crammed into only rows 17-19 (8's left spanning multiple rows but flattened, 3's/5's/9's/6's jumbled horizontally without vertical separation or alignment, e.g., 8's block rows 17-19 cols 1-9, then scattered smaller blobs like 3's at cols 10-12, 5's at 13-21, etc., ending with 6's right).
 * It differs from what we'd expect (based on training): should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with extracted shapes (8,3,5,9,6 colors visible) arranged in a multi-row grid layout (e.g., larger 8's block top, smaller ones below/right, bordered by 4's, centered), preserving relative original positions vertically; instead, horizontal cramming creates imbalance, no stacking (all in 3 rows), and excessive empty space, suggesting the same arrangement bug as training examples.
 * Shapes seem extracted correctly (e.g., large 8's, 9's block, 6's), but placement ignores vertical offsets—e.g., if test has vertically separated shapes, they should stack, not inline; rotation might have flipped some (unknown if needed).
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too sparse/empty, mismatched size, no visual "catalog" structure; likely fails if test expects similar to training 2's stacked layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on consistent patterns across both train inputs and outputs, the following interconnections are evident. These are limited to properties or components that show clear, repeated interactions (e.g., preservation, transformation triggers, or mutual effects) in every example. Only elements with consistent behavior are included; irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated single-pixel reds without effect, text overlays) are excluded. Unexplained aspects of transformations are noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Holed Shapes (holes > 0) and Background Formation**
   - **Components involved**: The single shape with holes > 0 (Red in Train 1 input; Green in Train 2 input).
   - **Interconnections**:
     - Color of holed shape → Output background color (Red background in Train 1 output; Green background in Train 2 output).
     - Hole count of holed shape → Hole count of output background (holes=3 preserved in Train 1; holes=5 preserved in Train 2).
     - Bounding box (bbox) of holed shape → Expanded bbox in output background (input bbox small/partial → output bbox covers full output area [0,0 to max dimensions]; expansion mechanism unknown).
     - Pixel count of holed shape → Increased pixel count in output background (Train 1: 28 → 112; Train 2: 121 → 484; increase consistent but scaling factor unknown, possibly affected by total output size or other shapes' placement).
   - **Effect on other components**: This background interacts with all preserved non-holed shapes by serving as the field they are placed upon (all outputs show non-background shapes positioned within or overlapping the background bbox).

#### 2. **Non-Holed Large Shapes (holes=0, pixels > 10) Preservation and Placement**
   - **Components involved**: Multi-pixel shapes excluding the holed one and single pixels (e.g., Maroon, Blue, Green in Train 1; Orange, Blue, Yellow, Pink, Green [non-holed instances] in Train 2).
   - **Interconnections**:
     - Color → Preserved exactly in output (e.g., Maroon remains Maroon; Blue remains Blue across both trains).
     - Pixel count → Preserved exactly in output (e.g., Train 1: Maroon=12, Blue=4, Green=16 all unchanged; Train 2: Orange=4, Blue=24, Yellow=24, Pink=20 all unchanged).
     - Hole count → Remains 0 in output (consistent preservation).
     - Bounding box (bbox) → Repositioned/possibly resized in output (e.g., Train 1 Blue [2,10,3,11] → [8,2,9,3]; Train 2 Yellow [11,8,18,13] → [10,2,17,7]; new positions consistent but transformation rule unknown, possibly influenced by background bbox or relative input positions).
   - **Effect from other components**: Placement appears affected by the background (all preserved shapes' output bboxes are subsets of or adjacent to the background bbox), but exact interaction (e.g., avoidance of holes) unknown.

#### 3. **Single-Pixel Components (holes=0, pixels=1, red variants: Dark Red, Maroon, Red)**
   - **Components involved**: Scattered single-pixel red-like elements (multiple in both Train 1 and Train 2 inputs).
   - **Interconnections**:
     - Presence → Absence in output (all removed consistently; no preservation of color, pixels, or bbox).
     - Possible effect on background: Their total pixels may contribute to background pixel increase (Train 1: ~10 single pixels → background +84 pixels; Train 2: ~6 single pixels → background +363 pixels), but contribution mechanism unknown and not definitively consistent without exact counting.
   - **Effect on other components**: No direct interaction with preserved shapes (no color/position changes tied to them); treated as non-interacting noise.

#### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **Inconsistent or irrelevant elements**: Text overlays (e.g., "H.4", "T.R." in yellow blocks) appear only in inputs and are absent in outputs consistently, but show no interaction (e.g., no effect on color, pixels, or position of yellow shapes). Small non-single-pixel reds (e.g., pixels=2-3 in Test Input 1) are not present in trains, so no consistent interaction identifiable. New colors (e.g., Light Blue, Pink in Test) assumed to follow non-holed preservation if large, but unverified.
- **Unknown transformations**: Specific rules for bbox repositioning/scaling (e.g., how input positions map to output) and background pixel increase (e.g., fill algorithm) are consistent in occurrence but unexplained from data. No forced connections (e.g., no assumed shape semantics like tetromino types affecting holes, as not consistent across examples). No high-level puzzle logic inferred.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

[2025-10-01 02:26:13] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains a background color and multiple connected components (shapes) of different colors, and the goal is to extract the "main" shapes (likely those with sufficient size, e.g., >=4 cells), normalize their position and orientation in a canonical way (translating to top-left, possibly rotating/flipping for consistency), and then reassemble them into a new output grid with the same background, arranged in a structured layout (e.g., sorted by original position or color, possibly stacked vertically with borders or spacing to match the expected compositions).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Extract only "main" shapes: Connected components of the same color, excluding the background (identified as the most frequent non-zero color), and filter to those with at least 4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalization is crucial but tricky: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; ensure consistent orientation by rotating clockwise if height > width (to prefer landscape), always flipping vertically (to prefer "upright" or top-heavy?), and conditionally flipping horizontally if the shape is "bottom-right heavy" (more cells in bottom-right quadrant than bottom-left, to prefer left-leaning or balanced asymmetry).
 * Arrangement rules: Shapes should be placed in the output in the order they appear when scanned top-to-bottom, left-to-right (based on the minimum row/col of the component), but stacked vertically rather than horizontally; include spacing or gaps (e.g., 1-2 cells of background) between shapes, and add a uniform border (thickness 2) around the entire composition; the inner grid height should accommodate the tallest shape, but the overall layout expands vertically for multiple shapes.
 * Background handling: Correctly identify as the most common non-zero color (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2, 4 in test); fill all non-shape areas with it; do not treat 0 as background if non-zero colors dominate.
 * Sorting and placement subtleties: After extraction, sort components by their original top-left position (min row, then min col); place each normalized shape at increasing y-positions (vertical stacking) with x-offsets to align left or center; ensure bounding boxes don't overlap and gaps prevent merging; in ex1, the 8-shape is placed highest, 1-shape mid-right, 3-shape lowest-right, suggesting vertical progression with horizontal offsets based on original relative positions.
 * Size and padding: Output should match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., ex1: 12 rows x 12 cols inner? but with border; ex2 taller with more vertical space); add border after inner composition; if no shapes, return a single bg cell.
 * Easy-to-miss elements: Shapes may have irregular forms (e.g., L-shapes or protrusions in ex1's 8 and 3); normalization flips/rotations must preserve connectivity and color but can alter visual "up" direction—over-flipping leads to mismatches (e.g., 3-shape in ex1 appears "upside-down" or mirrored in generated); original positions influence order/placement (not just color); small shapes (<4 cells) are ignored, but in ex2, some 1's and 5's seem split or partial.
 * General: Grids are rectangular; use 4-directional connectivity for flood-fill; handle empty/zero grids gracefully.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent non-zero color; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Flood-fill for connected components; essential and works correctly for extracting same-color blobs.)

```python
def extract_all_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    components.append((color, comp))
    components.sort(key=lambda x: (min(rr for rr, _ in x[1]), min(cc for _, cc in x[1])))
    return components
```
(Extracts and sorts main shapes by original top-left position; very helpful, correctly filters small components and orders by scan order.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not positions:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]

def get_bounding_box(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1
```
(Translation and bounding box utilities; core to normalization, work well but need integration with correct rotation/flip logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters main shapes (>=4 cells), sorts them by original position, and normalizes via translation/rotation/flip, but arranges them horizontally side-by-side with fixed gaps (1 cell), leading to wide, short grids instead of vertical stacking.
 * Train 1 generated a compact 8x18 grid (after border?) with 8-shape left, 1-shape mid, 3-shape right, all at similar heights (rows 2-5), but expected is 12x12 with vertical separation: 8-shape top (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1-shape mid-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9 but lower effective), empty space below 8, then 3-shape bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 4-9 and 8-11); difference: horizontal vs. vertical layout, no vertical spacing, and possible flip mismatch on 3-shape (appears shifted right in generated).
 * Train 2 generated a messy 10x34 horizontal jumble with shapes overlapping or poorly spaced (e.g., 1's and 5's mixed left, 4's and 6's mid-right, extra 5's/6's duplicated?), but expected is ~18x20 with vertical sections: upper 4's/5's stacked, mid 6's horizontal, lower 1's vertical with 5's right; differences: extreme width from horizontal placement, incorrect sorting/placement (e.g., 1's appear low but should be bottom, 5's duplicated or mispositioned), and border adds uneven padding; unknown why some shapes like 5's are split or extra in generated.
 * Normalization flips (always vertical, conditional horizontal) may over-correct, causing shape orientations to mismatch expected (e.g., 3 in ex1 looks "flipped" horizontally in generated vs. expected left-aligned); rotation only if h>w works but doesn't handle all asymmetries.
 * Arrangement uses max height for inner grid but places all at y=0 with x-offsets, ignoring vertical progression; should instead accumulate height with per-shape y-offsets based on order.
 * add_border is helpful and correct (thickness=2, pads uniformly), but applied to wrong inner layout.
 * is_bottom_right_heavy and flip functions are somewhat helpful for asymmetry but may be too aggressive—consider optional or rule-based (e.g., only if > certain imbalance threshold).
 * Overall, extraction/sorting is strong (shapes identified correctly), but layout is the core failure; no unhelpful functions, but the full program() integrates poorly (e.g., current_x accumulation assumes horizontal).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an extremely wide ~13x51 grid (after border) with all shapes (8,3,5,9,6, etc.) crammed horizontally in a single band (mostly rows 2-11), with some vertical extent for taller shapes like 8/9/6 but no true stacking—e.g., 8-shape left tall, then 3/5/9/6 clustered mid-right, all at similar heights with minimal gaps, leading to a linear "strip" composition.
 * It mismatches expected logic from trainings, which use vertical stacking with offsets (e.g., shapes at increasing y-positions, horizontal shifts for alignment); here, everything is side-by-side, causing overlaps or squeezes (e.g., 9-shape protrudes but not separated vertically from 6); border is added correctly, but inner layout is wrong—test likely needs taller grid with shapes like 8 top, 3/5 mid, 9/6 bottom, sorted by original positions, preserving relative x-offsets from input.
 * Does not make sense: Too horizontal and compact, ignores vertical order from extraction sort; possible normalization issues (e.g., 8-shape rotated wrong, appearing stretched); extra bg fills but no spacing between sections.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 02:27:37] Response:
- **Holed component (holes > 0, multi-pixel, color varies e.g., Red or Green)**: Self-interaction via transformation—bounding box dimensions doubled (width and height x2), pixel count quadrupled (x4), holes unchanged; repositioned to origin [0,0, new_maxx, new_maxy]. This expansion consistently affects placement of other elements by providing a new encompassing frame.
- **Multi-pixel components (holes=0, pixels >1, colors e.g., Blue, Green, Maroon, Yellow, Pink, Orange)**: Interact with the holed component via position transformation—relocated within the holed component's expanded bounding box; preserve color, holes=0, and pixel count; bounding box position changes, but dimensions and shape properties (inferred from pixels/bbox) unchanged. Exact relocation mechanism (e.g., relative positioning, rotation, or alignment rules) unknown and not consistently explainable from examples.
- **Single-pixel components (pixels=1, holes=0, typically Dark Red or Maroon)**: No interactions with any other components; consistently absent in outputs, treated as noise with no effect on transformations or other elements.

No other connections (e.g., color-to-color effects, hole count influencing non-holed components, specific shape silhouettes causing duplications, or pixel count transfers) are consistent across every example; variations like component duplication occur in only one puzzle and are excluded.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 02:27:37] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify the background color, extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors that meet a minimum size threshold, normalize each shape's orientation and position through translations, rotations, and flips to standardize their appearance (e.g., making them "bottom-left justified" based on weight distribution), and then rearrange these normalized shapes into a new compact grid arranged horizontally in the order they appear in the original grid (sorted by top-left position), with added borders and padding to form a square output grid while preserving the original colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most frequent non-zero color as background; ignore zeros and treat them as empty/transparent, but ensure extraction skips background entirely.
 * Shape extraction: Only consider 4-connected (up/down/left/right) components of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise should be omitted. Sort extracted shapes by their minimum row (topmost position), then by minimum column (leftmost within same row) to preserve reading order (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom in original grid).
 * Normalization subtleties: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. If height > width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise to prefer landscape orientation, then re-translate. For vertical flip: Divide bounding box height in half; if bottom half has equal or more cells than top half, flip vertically (upside-down) and re-translate—this prefers "upright" or balanced shapes but can invert if bottom-heavy. For horizontal flip: In the bottom half, if more cells are on the right than left, flip horizontally (mirror left-right) and re-translate—this prefers left-heavy bottoms. Recalculate bounding box after each transformation. These flips/rotations can subtly change how shapes "face" or align, and equal-weight cases flip vertical (which might not always be desired if the puzzle expects "as-is" for balanced shapes).
 * Arrangement: Place normalized shapes side-by-side horizontally in a row, with 1-cell gaps between them (but no leading gap for the first). Use the max height across all shapes for the row height; widths add up with gaps. This creates a rectangular inner grid.
 * Border and padding: Add a thin border (size 1 in this attempt, but expected seems to use size 2 or variable) of background color around the inner grid. Then pad the entire bordered grid to a square by centering it in a larger grid of side length equal to max(outer_height, outer_width), filling extras with background—this ensures square output but can lead to oversized grids if inner arrangement is too wide/tall.
 * Grid sizing issues: Outputs must match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected 12x12, but generated 16x16; train2 expected ~20x28? but generated 32x32). Avoid over-padding or assuming fixed sizes; calculate minimally. Preserve exact cell counts and positions from normalized shapes without overlap or clipping.
 * Color preservation: Keep original colors for shapes; do not change them during normalization or placement.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have uneven shapes, multiple components per color, or shapes touching borders. Zeros are not background but empty—do not treat as shapes. If no shapes, output minimal background grid. Sorting ensures order like reading a book, which might place vertically stacked shapes in input as sequential in output.
 * Potential misses: The >=4 cell threshold works but might filter too aggressively if small shapes are intended. Horizontal arrangement assumes all fit in one row; if too wide, might need multi-row or vertical stacking (not handled here). Border size is inconsistent (attempt uses 1, but expected visuals suggest 2). Flips might over-transform (e.g., equal bottom/top flips vertical, but expected might keep original orientation). Padding centers but can create uneven borders if dimensions differ oddly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it correctly identifies background via frequency and extracts components using flood fill with size filter and sorting by position, which isolates main shapes in order.
 * Normalization functions (translate, bounding box, heaviness checks, flips, rotate) are conceptually helpful for standardizing shapes but produce incorrect orientations/flips in outputs (e.g., shapes appear inverted or mirrored compared to expected, possibly due to flipping on equal weights or unnecessary rotations).
 * Horizontal arrangement with gaps works in theory but fails in practice: shapes are placed but with wrong spacing (no gaps in some expected), leading to oversized inner grids; train1 places only partial/wrong shapes (e.g., only 3's visible, missing 8/1), train2 crams multiple shapes into one area without proper separation.
 * Border addition (size 1) and padding to square are implemented but wrong: uses border=1 (expected visuals suggest 2), and padding over-expands (e.g., train1 to 16x16 vs expected 12x12; train2 to 32x32 vs ~20x28; test to ~50x50 vs likely smaller compact square), centering but creating too much empty space.
 * arrange_shapes_horizontal adds +1 gaps between shapes (including after last?), inflating width unnecessarily—expected has tighter packing without consistent gaps.
 * place_shape is basic and correct for overlaying but clips if out-of-bounds (not an issue here).
 * Overall, extraction and normalization are partially working (shapes are detected), but transformation rules are too aggressive/subtle mismatches (e.g., unknown why train1 only shows 3's, perhaps extraction missed colors or sorting failed); arrangement/bordering/padding bloat the grid size and misplace elements.
 * Function add_border is helpful but needs adjustable size (try 2); pad_to_max_dimension is relevant but over-pads—consider minimal square without centering if not needed.
 * Functions like count_cells_in_half, is_bottom_heavy, flip_vertical, count_bottom_left_right, is_bottom_right_heavy, flip_horizontal are tied to normalization and provide weight-based decisions, but may be overkill or incorrect for puzzle (e.g., expected shapes seem unrotated/unflipped in train1/2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an enormously oversized ~50x50 grid (way larger than needed) filled almost entirely with background 4's, with shapes (6,9,8,5) crammed into the bottom rows (rows 20-29) in a dense, non-arranged cluster without horizontal spacing, borders, or proper padding/centering—expected should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with shapes arranged horizontally in sorted order, thin borders, and minimal padding, preserving distinct separated positions like in training examples.
 * Shapes appear partially normalized (e.g., 9's in a block, 6's extended, 8/5 adjacent) but not translated/rotated/flipped correctly, and placement ignores order/sorting, leading to overlap or wrong adjacency; no visible borders, and excessive empty space above suggests failed inner grid calculation or padding explosion.
 * This highlights the same issues as training: over-sized output from bad arrangement + padding, incomplete shape extraction/placement (possibly missed some components or colors), and normalization not matching expected orientations (e.g., if test has tall shapes, rotation might have failed silently).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 possibly empty but backgrounds are non-zero), and the goal is to identify distinct connected shapes (blobs of the same color, excluding the background), normalize their positions and orientations to a standard form, and rearrange them into a new larger grid framed by the background color, with shapes placed in a specific spatial layout (e.g., horizontally adjacent or in rows/columns based on original positions) rather than simply stacked.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other colors represent potential shapes, but only connected components (4-connected, via flood fill) of size >=4 cells are considered "main shapes"—smaller blobs are ignored.
 * Shapes must be extracted per color, taking the largest component per color if multiple exist (as in the code's components_by_color logic).
 * Normalization involves translating the shape to (0,0) top-left, then optionally rotating 90 degrees clockwise if height >= width (to prefer wider orientations?), checking for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top half) and flipping vertically if so, then trimming empty space from top/left to re-minimize bounding box— this seems partially correct but may over-rotate or flip in ways that distort shapes relative to expected outputs.
 * Arrangement is key: the code stacks shapes vertically into a square inner canvas (summing heights, max width, padding to square), then adds a 1-cell border, but expected outputs place shapes horizontally adjacent (e.g., in example 1, 8's left, 1's middle-right, 3's bottom-right; in example 2, shapes like 4's and 6's are split across rows/columns), suggesting sorting by original min row position and placing side-by-side or in a grid layout to fit within a bordered frame matching input dimensions or expanded minimally.
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by min row of positions, which is good for vertical order, but expected seems to preserve horizontal relationships or place in original relative positions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs expand the grid (e.g., example 1 input likely 10x10 becomes 12x12 framed), with empty space filled by background; shapes don't overlap and are not rotated/flipped in ways that change their relative "up" direction—code's bottom-heavy flip may be unnecessary or wrongly applied.
 * Handle empty/whitespace: Grids may have irregular shapes; ensure no overwriting during placement.
 * Colors: Preserve original colors; background frames everything.
 * Edge cases: Multiple components per color (take largest); no shapes (return minimal bg grid); varying input sizes.
 * Puzzle rules imply preserving shape integrity—no scaling, just translation/rotation/flip for canonical form, then precise placement to match a "composed" image where shapes are juxtaposed as if "cut out" and reassembled in a new composition.

                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the most common non-zero as bg, useful for framing and exclusion.)

                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components per color.)

```python
def extract_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components_by_color = {}
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                size = len(component)
                if size >= 4:
                    if color not in components_by_color or size > len(components_by_color[color][1]):
                        components_by_color[color] = (color, component)
    shapes = list(components_by_color.values())
    shapes.sort(key=lambda x: min(pr for pr, pc in x[1]))
    return shapes
```
(This is helpful for identifying and sorting largest shapes by min row, but may need adjustment to handle multiple per color or different sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2) and extracts main shapes via flood fill, ignoring small components and bg— this worked for finding the right colors and rough positions.
 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors in an input grid, normalize their positions, orientations, and shapes to a standard form (e.g., top-left aligned, possibly rotated or flipped for consistency), and then rearrange them horizontally side-by-side in a new output grid filled with the background color, ensuring the overall output is a square grid with optional bordering padding while preserving the relative internal structure of each shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the dominant color in the grid (most frequent non-zero value), but it may surround shapes or fill large areas; do not treat zero as background unless specified, and ensure shapes are only extracted if they are connected components of the same color with at least a minimum size (e.g., >=4 cells in the code, but this threshold may be arbitrary or unnecessary).
 * Shapes must be extracted via flood fill on connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right), ignoring background and other colors; small or isolated cells (<4) are skipped, which worked but may over-filter if shapes are small.
 * Normalization is crucial: translate shapes to (0,0) origin (min row/col = 0), determine bounding box height/width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise if height > width to make them landscape-oriented, flip horizontally if the bottom half has more mass on the right than left (to standardize "facing" or asymmetry), and re-normalize origin after transformations; this attempts to canonicalize shapes but fails in examples due to incorrect rotation/flipping logic (e.g., over-rotates or flips asymmetrically, leading to distorted placements).
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by minimum row position in original grid (top-to-bottom order of first appearance), which may be correct for reading order but doesn't match expected horizontal left-to-right arrangement in outputs.
 * Placement: Shapes are placed side-by-side horizontally in rows, aligned to the top of the output grid, with their normalized widths added cumulatively; add 1-cell borders top/bottom/left/right around the entire arrangement, then pad to make the output square by adding background rows/columns centered (e.g., if wider than tall, add rows in the middle); total output size should match the minimal square enclosing the bordered arrangement, but code over-pads massively (e.g., +2 borders then squaring leads to oversized grids).
 * Subtleties: Preserve exact relative positions within each shape (no stretching/compression); do not merge shapes or alter colors; output must exactly match expected dimensions and cell values, including background fills; in examples, shapes are abutted directly without gaps between them, but bordered overall; rotations/flips must ensure shapes "face" consistently (e.g., bottom-heavy or asymmetric shapes flipped to standardize); minimum shape size (>=4) skips noise but may miss valid small shapes; background identification counts only non-zero, but if all zero, defaults to 0—ensure it doesn't misidentify shapes as background.
 * Edge cases: Grids with no shapes return single background cell; varying shape sizes require dynamic max height for vertical alignment; if arrangement is taller than wide post-border, pad columns centered; test input has multiple shapes (colors 8,3,5,9,6?) that need sequential horizontal placement without distortion.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid re-processing; use deque for BFS efficiency; counter for background via frequency; handle empty grids; sorting by y-position assumes vertical scanning order, but examples suggest left-to-right or appearance order; final squaring pads symmetrically but code's half = extra//2 may off-center if odd; generated outputs show shapes concatenated horizontally but with wrong normalization (e.g., 8's block is too wide/tall, 1's misplaced), leading to non-matching dimensions (14x14 vs expected 12x12 for train1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This works well for finding the most frequent non-background color as bg, but may need adjustment if bg is zero or sparse.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:

                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of the same color, avoiding background and other shapes; use it in future attempts.)

def get_h_w(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in positions)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```
(This correctly computes bounding box height/width from positions; helpful for normalization and placement sizing.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (The full function from the code is partially helpful for origin translation and basic rotation/flip, but broken in rotation logic—if h > w, it rotates but then swaps h/w incorrectly, and flip condition based on bottom-half mass is heuristic but misapplies, leading to distorted shapes; salvage the translation parts but rewrite rotation/flip.)
```
(Partially helpful for translation to (0,0) and bounding box calc, but the rotation (if h>w, rotate to landscape then flip vertically?) and flip (bottom-right > bottom-left mass) are flawed and cause mismatches; do not reuse as-is, but adapt the min_r/min_c normalization.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 for train1, 3 for train2) and extracts components via flood fill, skipping small ones (>=4 cells), which worked for finding main shapes but may be too strict.
 * Normalization attempts to standardize orientation (rotate if tall, flip if asymmetric) but fails: for train1, the 8-shape is rotated/flipped into a 4x4 block instead of expected 4-high x 4-wide with cutout; 1-shape becomes 2x2 but misplaced; 3-shape distorted to 2-high x 6-wide but wrong alignment.
 * Placement sorts shapes by min row (vertical order), then concatenates horizontally with no gaps, adds borders, and pads to square—but over-pads (e.g., train1 becomes 14x14 instead of 12x12, with shapes centered wrongly in rows 6-9 instead of rows 3-10 top-aligned); for train2, shapes are crammed into rows 12-16 with huge background overhead (28x28 vs expected ~20x20), and order wrong (1's,5's,4's,6's misplaced relative to expected vertical-ish but horizontal arrangement).
 * Train1 generated: Shapes horizontally concatenated but normalized wrongly (8's too blocky/wide, 1's shifted right, 3's bottom-heavy flip failed), dimensions oversized with borders, shapes in middle rows 6-9 with top/bottom all-bg rows; expected: 12x12, shapes top-aligned in rows 3-10, 8's left (4w), then 1's (2w), then 3's (6w max), with precise cutouts (e.g., 8's have 2-wide bottom).
 * Train2 generated: All-bg top 11 rows, shapes in 12-16 (1's left, then 5's/4's/6's distorted/wrong widths), bottom all-bg; expected: More compact ~20x20, shapes in scattered rows (e.g., 4's mid-right rows 3-8, 6's lower rows 11-16, 1's bottom rows 19-26, 5's integrated), horizontal but with vertical spacing preserved? Wait, expected seems to rearrange in appearance order horizontally per "section" but code linearizes wrongly.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken (rotation swaps h/w but positions list incorrectly, flip miscalculates mass leading to upside-down or mirrored shapes); do not use as-is.
 * Overall, component extraction essential and works, but sorting/placement/padding logic misses top-alignment, exact widths, and minimal sizing; unknown why train2 expected has shapes not strictly horizontal (e.g., 1's at bottom, 5's overlapping sections)—may need order by first appearance x-then-y, not just y.
 * Test output generated: A massive ~32x48 grid (way oversized from over-padding/squaring), mostly all 4's (bg), with shapes only in rows 18-20 (8's left long block, then 3's/5's/9's/6's concatenated but distorted: 8's 3-high x10-wide instead of structured, 9's 3-high x9-wide blocky, 6's trailing); this does not look correct—expected should be compact square (maybe 20x20+), shapes normalized and top-aligned horizontally in order of appearance (likely 8,3,5,9,6 from positions), preserving cutouts (e.g., 8's probably L or irregular, not solid; 9's stepped, 6's bar-like), with 1-cell borders and centered padding if needed, not this huge empty expanse; differences: wrong dims/shape integrity/placement, shapes merged/distorted without gaps but wrong orientations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it is an oversized rectangular-then-squared grid (~32 rows x 48 cols, padded to square?) with excessive background, shapes only in a narrow band (rows 18-20), and visible distortions (e.g., 8's as solid 10-wide bar instead of expected irregular form with holes/cutouts, 9's blocky without steps, overall not top-aligned or compact).
 * The test output is missing proper normalization (no rotation/flip to standard, leading to raw concatenated widths totaling ~40+), exact shape preservation (flood fill captures but transforms break structure), and minimal sizing (should be ~22x22 bordered square based on max h~8-10, total w~30-40, pad to square).
 * Make sure to account for multiple asymmetric shapes (e.g., 3's small, 5's/6's medium, 9's large stepped, 8's complex) by improving flip/rotate heuristics and sorting by scan order (row-major left-to-right-top-to-bottom) to handle test case; unknown why generated is so vertically centered with huge top/bottom bg, but likely from code's +2 borders then aggressive squaring without trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting connected components (blobs) of the same non-background color from an input grid, filtering out small ones (less than 4 cells), normalizing their positions to a local origin, optionally rotating them to prefer landscape orientation, sorting them by their original top-left positions, and then reassembling them into a new compact grid with a background border and padding to a square shape. The goal is to create a "catalog" or standardized rendering of the extracted shapes while preserving their identities and relative ordering, but the current approach fails in arrangement, leading to mismatched layouts compared to expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color (or 0 if none); all other colors are treated as foreground for components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and same-color; only extract those with >=4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalize each component by translating positions relative to its min_r and min_c, compute its bounding box height (h) and width (w).
 * Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if h > w (tall shapes) to make them wider, updating positions as (c, h-1-r); this prefers horizontal/landscape shapes but may alter visual orientation subtly.
 * Sort extracted shapes by original (min_r, min_c) to process in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, mimicking reading order.
 * Arrangement is critical: current horizontal side-by-side placement creates a thin strip, but expected outputs suggest a more grid-like or vertically stacked layout that preserves relative vertical positioning (e.g., top shapes above bottom ones, with horizontal alignment within rows).
 * Add a 1-cell border of background around the inner arrangement, then pad the entire grid to the nearest square (max dimension) with background, centering the content.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs have consistent sizing (e.g., 12x12 for training 1, 20x20 for training 2), implying the inner arrangement's max_h and total_w determine the final side length after border (+2) and padding.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may overlap or align in the new grid based on original relative positions, but current code ignores vertical offsets and packs everything into one row; also, rotation may misalign shapes if the puzzle expects no rotation or different rotation logic.
 * Handle empty grids or no valid components by returning a single background cell.
 * Outputs use lists of lists, with rows as lists of ints; ensure deep copies to avoid mutation.
 * Potential edge: Shapes with irregular bounding boxes (e.g., L-shapes) must fill their relative positions correctly without gaps in the new grid.

    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts and filters components >=4 cells, with min_r/min_c for sorting; core to identifying valid shapes, but note it skips background cells correctly.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    relative = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]
    h = max(r for r, _ in relative) + 1
    w = max(c for _, c in relative) + 1
    return relative, h, w
```
(This normalizes shape positions to (0,0) origin and computes tight bounding box; helpful for isolating shapes.)

```python
def rotate_if_tall(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if h <= w:
        return positions, h, w
    new_positions = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]
    new_h = w
    new_w = h
    return new_positions, new_h, new_w
```
(This rotates tall shapes to landscape; useful but may be a subtlety—puzzle might not require rotation, or it could be causing mismatches in shape orientation.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    new_h = gh + 2
    new_w = gw + 2
    new_grid = [[bg] * new_w for _ in range(new_h)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This adds a 1-cell background border; correct and necessary for framing.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    side = max(gh, gw)
    if gh == 0 or gw == 0:
        return [[bg]]
    if side == gh == gw:
        return [row[:] for row in grid]  # copy
    new_grid = [[bg] * side for _ in range(side)]
    offset_r = (side - gh) // 2
    offset_c = (side - gw) // 2
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[offset_r + i][offset_c + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This centers and pads to square with background; works well but amplifies issues if inner grid is imbalanced.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters components (>=4 cells), normalizes positions, and applies optional rotation, but fails in sorting and arrangement: shapes are sorted by (min_r, min_c) but placed horizontally side-by-side in a single row, creating a thin inner grid (e.g., height ~2-4, wide total_w), leading to many empty rows after bordering and square-padding.
 * For training example 1: Generated a 14x14 grid with all shapes crammed into rows 5-8 (8's left, 1's middle, 3's right, but misaligned and no vertical separation), surrounded by 2's border and top/bottom padding; expected is 12x12 with 8's top-left (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1's top-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9), 3's bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 8-13, horizontal), preserving vertical ordering and compactness—generated mismatches by flattening to one row and oversized padding.
 * For training example 2: Generated a 28x28 grid (way oversized) with 10+ empty rows top/bottom, shapes crammed into rows 11-16 (1's left, 5's scattered, 4's/6's middle-right, but jumbled and no grid structure); expected is 20x20 with shapes in a multi-row layout (4's/5's top-middle rows 2-7, 6's middle rows 10-15, 1's bottom rows 18-25, with vertical stacking and horizontal alignment within "rows" of shapes)—generated differs by horizontal packing, wrong size, and poor alignment (e.g., 1's and 5's fragmented).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order but doesn't account for vertical grouping; build_inner_grid is broken for multi-row arrangements—needs to place shapes in rows based on original min_r buckets or similar.
 * Rotation may be unhelpful or incorrect: e.g., in training 1, 3's is horizontal in expected but might be rotated if tall; don't use if it distorts expected shapes.
 * Flood_fill and extract_raw_components are essential and correct for component detection; translate_to_origin is helpful for normalization.
 * add_border and pad_to_square are correct but highlight arrangement flaws (e.g., thin inner -> empty square).
 * Overall, extraction works (shapes identified correctly), but rearrangement doesn't mimic the expected "poster" or "inventory" layout with vertical stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it's a massive ~48x48? grid (inferred from 48 elements per row) mostly filled with background 4's (empty rows 0-16 and 20-47), with shapes crammed into only rows 17-19 (8's left spanning multiple rows but flattened, 3's/5's/9's/6's jumbled horizontally without vertical separation or alignment, e.g., 8's block rows 17-19 cols 1-9, then scattered smaller blobs like 3's at cols 10-12, 5's at 13-21, etc., ending with 6's right).
 * It differs from what we'd expect (based on training): should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with extracted shapes (8,3,5,9,6 colors visible) arranged in a multi-row grid layout (e.g., larger 8's block top, smaller ones below/right, bordered by 4's, centered), preserving relative original positions vertically; instead, horizontal cramming creates imbalance, no stacking (all in 3 rows), and excessive empty space, suggesting the same arrangement bug as training examples.
 * Shapes seem extracted correctly (e.g., large 8's, 9's block, 6's), but placement ignores vertical offsets—e.g., if test has vertically separated shapes, they should stack, not inline; rotation might have flipped some (unknown if needed).
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too sparse/empty, mismatched size, no visual "catalog" structure; likely fails if test expects similar to training 2's stacked layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains a background color and multiple connected components (shapes) of different colors, and the goal is to extract the "main" shapes (likely those with sufficient size, e.g., >=4 cells), normalize their position and orientation in a canonical way (translating to top-left, possibly rotating/flipping for consistency), and then reassemble them into a new output grid with the same background, arranged in a structured layout (e.g., sorted by original position or color, possibly stacked vertically with borders or spacing to match the expected compositions).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Extract only "main" shapes: Connected components of the same color, excluding the background (identified as the most frequent non-zero color), and filter to those with at least 4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalization is crucial but tricky: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; ensure consistent orientation by rotating clockwise if height > width (to prefer landscape), always flipping vertically (to prefer "upright" or top-heavy?), and conditionally flipping horizontally if the shape is "bottom-right heavy" (more cells in bottom-right quadrant than bottom-left, to prefer left-leaning or balanced asymmetry).
 * Arrangement rules: Shapes should be placed in the output in the order they appear when scanned top-to-bottom, left-to-right (based on the minimum row/col of the component), but stacked vertically rather than horizontally; include spacing or gaps (e.g., 1-2 cells of background) between shapes, and add a uniform border (thickness 2) around the entire composition; the inner grid height should accommodate the tallest shape, but the overall layout expands vertically for multiple shapes.
 * Background handling: Correctly identify as the most common non-zero color (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2, 4 in test); fill all non-shape areas with it; do not treat 0 as background if non-zero colors dominate.
 * Sorting and placement subtleties: After extraction, sort components by their original top-left position (min row, then min col); place each normalized shape at increasing y-positions (vertical stacking) with x-offsets to align left or center; ensure bounding boxes don't overlap and gaps prevent merging; in ex1, the 8-shape is placed highest, 1-shape mid-right, 3-shape lowest-right, suggesting vertical progression with horizontal offsets based on original relative positions.
 * Size and padding: Output should match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., ex1: 12 rows x 12 cols inner? but with border; ex2 taller with more vertical space); add border after inner composition; if no shapes, return a single bg cell.
 * Easy-to-miss elements: Shapes may have irregular forms (e.g., L-shapes or protrusions in ex1's 8 and 3); normalization flips/rotations must preserve connectivity and color but can alter visual "up" direction—over-flipping leads to mismatches (e.g., 3-shape in ex1 appears "upside-down" or mirrored in generated); original positions influence order/placement (not just color); small shapes (<4 cells) are ignored, but in ex2, some 1's and 5's seem split or partial.
 * General: Grids are rectangular; use 4-directional connectivity for flood-fill; handle empty/zero grids gracefully.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent non-zero color; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Flood-fill for connected components; essential and works correctly for extracting same-color blobs.)

```python
def extract_all_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    components.append((color, comp))
    components.sort(key=lambda x: (min(rr for rr, _ in x[1]), min(cc for _, cc in x[1])))
    return components
```
(Extracts and sorts main shapes by original top-left position; very helpful, correctly filters small components and orders by scan order.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not positions:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]

def get_bounding_box(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1
```
(Translation and bounding box utilities; core to normalization, work well but need integration with correct rotation/flip logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters main shapes (>=4 cells), sorts them by original position, and normalizes via translation/rotation/flip, but arranges them horizontally side-by-side with fixed gaps (1 cell), leading to wide, short grids instead of vertical stacking.
 * Train 1 generated a compact 8x18 grid (after border?) with 8-shape left, 1-shape mid, 3-shape right, all at similar heights (rows 2-5), but expected is 12x12 with vertical separation: 8-shape top (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1-shape mid-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9 but lower effective), empty space below 8, then 3-shape bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 4-9 and 8-11); difference: horizontal vs. vertical layout, no vertical spacing, and possible flip mismatch on 3-shape (appears shifted right in generated).
 * Train 2 generated a messy 10x34 horizontal jumble with shapes overlapping or poorly spaced (e.g., 1's and 5's mixed left, 4's and 6's mid-right, extra 5's/6's duplicated?), but expected is ~18x20 with vertical sections: upper 4's/5's stacked, mid 6's horizontal, lower 1's vertical with 5's right; differences: extreme width from horizontal placement, incorrect sorting/placement (e.g., 1's appear low but should be bottom, 5's duplicated or mispositioned), and border adds uneven padding; unknown why some shapes like 5's are split or extra in generated.
 * Normalization flips (always vertical, conditional horizontal) may over-correct, causing shape orientations to mismatch expected (e.g., 3 in ex1 looks "flipped" horizontally in generated vs. expected left-aligned); rotation only if h>w works but doesn't handle all asymmetries.
 * Arrangement uses max height for inner grid but places all at y=0 with x-offsets, ignoring vertical progression; should instead accumulate height with per-shape y-offsets based on order.
 * add_border is helpful and correct (thickness=2, pads uniformly), but applied to wrong inner layout.
 * is_bottom_right_heavy and flip functions are somewhat helpful for asymmetry but may be too aggressive—consider optional or rule-based (e.g., only if > certain imbalance threshold).
 * Overall, extraction/sorting is strong (shapes identified correctly), but layout is the core failure; no unhelpful functions, but the full program() integrates poorly (e.g., current_x accumulation assumes horizontal).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an extremely wide ~13x51 grid (after border) with all shapes (8,3,5,9,6, etc.) crammed horizontally in a single band (mostly rows 2-11), with some vertical extent for taller shapes like 8/9/6 but no true stacking—e.g., 8-shape left tall, then 3/5/9/6 clustered mid-right, all at similar heights with minimal gaps, leading to a linear "strip" composition.
 * It mismatches expected logic from trainings, which use vertical stacking with offsets (e.g., shapes at increasing y-positions, horizontal shifts for alignment); here, everything is side-by-side, causing overlaps or squeezes (e.g., 9-shape protrudes but not separated vertically from 6); border is added correctly, but inner layout is wrong—test likely needs taller grid with shapes like 8 top, 3/5 mid, 9/6 bottom, sorted by original positions, preserving relative x-offsets from input.
 * Does not make sense: Too horizontal and compact, ignores vertical order from extraction sort; possible normalization issues (e.g., 8-shape rotated wrong, appearing stretched); extra bg fills but no spacing between sections.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- **Holed component (holes > 0, multi-pixel, color varies e.g., Red or Green)**: Self-interaction via transformation—bounding box dimensions doubled (width and height x2), pixel count quadrupled (x4), holes unchanged; repositioned to origin [0,0, new_maxx, new_maxy]. This expansion consistently affects placement of other elements by providing a new encompassing frame.
- **Multi-pixel components (holes=0, pixels >1, colors e.g., Blue, Green, Maroon, Yellow, Pink, Orange)**: Interact with the holed component via position transformation—relocated within the holed component's expanded bounding box; preserve color, holes=0, and pixel count; bounding box position changes, but dimensions and shape properties (inferred from pixels/bbox) unchanged. Exact relocation mechanism (e.g., relative positioning, rotation, or alignment rules) unknown and not consistently explainable from examples.
- **Single-pixel components (pixels=1, holes=0, typically Dark Red or Maroon)**: No interactions with any other components; consistently absent in outputs, treated as noise with no effect on transformations or other elements.

No other connections (e.g., color-to-color effects, hole count influencing non-holed components, specific shape silhouettes causing duplications, or pixel count transfers) are consistent across every example; variations like component duplication occur in only one puzzle and are excluded.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 02:33:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from a grid, normalizing their orientation and position to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips based on heuristics like bottom-heaviness or right-heaviness), sorting them by original position, and then rearranging them into a new bordered grid with the background color, likely in a packed row-based layout to simulate a "catalog" or standardized display of the shapes while preserving their normalized forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all empty spaces in the output use this.
 * Extract only connected components (4-connected, same color) with at least 4 cells; ignore smaller blobs or single cells.
 * Components must be flood-filled correctly to capture full shapes, even irregular ones like L-shapes or those with protrusions.
 * Normalization is critical: translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; if height > width, rotate 90° clockwise; check for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top) and flip vertically if so (especially after rotation); check for "bottom-right heavy" (in bottom half, more cells on right than left) and flip horizontally if so; re-translate after each transform to keep origin at (0,0).
 * Sorting: Components are sorted by their original minimum row and column (top-left position in source grid), which determines arrangement order.
 * Arrangement: Pack shapes into rows on a new canvas; use a capacity limit (e.g., max_width + max_height of shapes) to decide when to start a new row; add horizontal gaps (e.g., 2 units) between shapes in a row, vertical gaps (e.g., 0) between rows; align shapes left-to-right in rows, top-to-bottom for rows; compute total canvas size based on max row dimensions.
 * Border: Add a uniform border (thickness 2) of background color around the arranged inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations/flips must update bounding box dimensions correctly after each step; "heaviness" checks only apply if height/width >1; arrangement may need to align shapes to a baseline (e.g., bottom-aligned in rows?) or handle varying heights without vertical centering; original positions influence order but not final placement beyond sorting; ensure no overlaps or out-of-bounds writes; the expected outputs show shapes in "canonical" orientations that look standardized (e.g., L-shapes opening rightward or downward), suggesting normalization is key but may need additional rules like preferring certain rotations.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must respect grid bounds and only same-color cells; normalization can chain (e.g., rotate then flip, re-check heaviness); packing may fail if capacity is miscalculated (e.g., too small, causing unnecessary row breaks); shapes like partial rectangles or hooks (e.g., the 3's L-shape) get flipped to a consistent form, but if flips are wrong, they appear mirrored or rotated incorrectly in output; border thickness is fixed at 2, and canvas must be exactly sized to fit with border.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it handles extraction and normalization partially; issues in packing lead to misaligned rows (e.g., shapes starting at wrong x-offsets); test case has multiple rows of shapes (8,5,9,6 with small 3's), suggesting need for multi-row packing without excessive gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common non-zero color; useful and accurate.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This performs standard 4-connected flood-fill for same-color components; essential and works well for extracting shapes.)

```python
def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts components >=4 cells, ignoring bg and small blobs; very helpful, sorts later by min_r/min_c; accurate for identifying objects.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not positions:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]

def get_bounding_box(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1

def rotate_90_cw(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]

def flip_vertical(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(h - 1 - r, c) for r, c in positions]

def flip_horizontal(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(r, w - 1 - c) for r, c in positions]
```
(These handle translation, bounding box, and basic transforms; core to normalization and work correctly individually, but chaining in normalize_shape needs fixes for re-translation and re-bounding after each step.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    rotated = False
    if h > w:
        positions = rotate_90_cw(positions, h, w)
        rotated = True
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    do_v_flip = rotated or is_bottom_heavy(positions, h)
    if do_v_flip:
        positions = flip_vertical(positions, h)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    if is_bottom_right_heavy(positions, h, w):
        positions = flip_horizontal(positions, w)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    return color, positions
```
(This attempts full normalization but is buggy: is_bottom_heavy and is_bottom_right_heavy definitions may be incorrect—bottom_heavy counts top vs bottom but doesn't specify "heavy" threshold clearly; bottom_right_heavy only checks bottom half and compares left/right counts strictly (>); vertical flip condition ties to rotation oddly; doesn't handle multiple rotations or full 360° normalization; re-bounding after flips is good but heaviness checks may need to be recursive or more robust for irregular shapes.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], thickness: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg for _ in range(nw)] for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This correctly adds a fixed-thickness border; helpful and accurate.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided, but it successfully extracts components (e.g., identifies 8,1,3 in train1 and various in train2/test), normalizes positions to origin, and adds border correctly.
 * What worked: Background detection, flood-fill extraction (captures full shapes >=4 cells), translation to origin, basic rotation/flip mechanics, sorting by original min_r/min_c, and border addition; the inner grid filling avoids overlaps.
 * What didn't work: Normalization heuristics are incomplete—e.g., in train1, the 3-shape (likely an L or hook) isn't flipped/rotated to match expected (generated places it as a left-aligned partial rectangle in row 6-9 cols 6-9, but expected has it right-shifted in row 6-7 cols 8-9 and full in row 8-9 cols 4-9, suggesting wrong canonical orientation); in train2, multiple shapes (1,5,4,6) are packed incorrectly (generated spreads them across rows with wrong alignments, e.g., 1's left then 5's right, but expected groups 4's large in middle-right, 5's small left, 6's bottom, 1's bottom-left with extensions).
 * Arrangement/packing is the main failure: Uses capacity = max_w + max_h (e.g., ~8 for squares), gap_h=2, but breaks rows too early or left-aligns without matching expected offsets (e.g., train1 generated puts 3's at col 6, expected at col 4-9 with gap; train2 generated has vertical stacking issues, e.g., 4's split across rows wrongly); no vertical alignment within rows (shapes may need bottom-alignment); total canvas sizing pads correctly but positions don't match.
 * Sorting works (order seems 8 then 1 then 3 in train1, matching original positions), but downstream packing ignores subtle spacing (e.g., expected has larger gaps or fixed columns).
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is broken/not helpful: Capacity logic causes poor packing (e.g., fits 8+1 in row1 but 3 alone in row2 left-aligned; train2 overflows rows wrongly); gaps are asymmetric (h=2, v=0); doesn't compute max row width correctly for centering or right-alignment; suggest replacing with fixed-grid or better knapsack-style packing.
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is partially helpful but flawed: Simple half-split count works for symmetric cases but fails for irregulars (e.g., L-shapes may not trigger flip correctly; threshold is >= but may need > or weighted center-of-mass).
 * Function `is_bottom_right_heavy` similar issue: Only bottom-half check is good, but strict > count may miss balanced-but-skewed shapes; applied too late in chain.
 * Overall, extraction/normalization gets ~70% right (shapes identifiable), but transform logic and packing need overhaul for orientations and layout to match expected standardized arrangements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it rearranges shapes (large 8/9/5/6 blocks, small 3's) into a multi-row packed grid with border 4, but the layout is misaligned similar to trainings—e.g., 8's top-left spanning rows 2-10 cols 2-11, small 3's awkwardly next to it in rows 2-4 cols 12-15, then 5's below in rows 11-20 with internal structure (suggesting partial normalization of a complex shape), 9's mid-right rows 20-28, 6's bottom rows 29-38; this seems like linear left-to-right packing with row breaks, but expected likely needs better canonical orientations (e.g., all "bottom-left" aligned L's or hooks) and tighter/spaced rows matching original relative positions or a grid-like catalog (e.g., sorted into 2-3 per row with even spacing); small 3's are repeated/clustered oddly, possibly from extraction error or no deduping; overall, it "makes sense" as an attempt at rearrangement but fails subtlety like train cases (wrong flips cause 5/9/6 to appear stretched vertically/horizontally; packing capacity too loose, leading to tall thin canvas instead of compact); to handle test, need to refine heaviness to prefer "opening right/down" for hooks, increase gap_h to 3-4 for alignment, and ensure post-transform bounding boxes trigger correct row heights.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify the background color, extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors that meet a minimum size threshold, normalize each shape's orientation and position through translations, rotations, and flips to standardize their appearance (e.g., making them "bottom-left justified" based on weight distribution), and then rearrange these normalized shapes into a new compact grid arranged horizontally in the order they appear in the original grid (sorted by top-left position), with added borders and padding to form a square output grid while preserving the original colors.

 * Background identification: Use the most frequent non-zero color as background; ignore zeros and treat them as empty/transparent, but ensure extraction skips background entirely.
 * Shape extraction: Only consider 4-connected (up/down/left/right) components of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise should be omitted. Sort extracted shapes by their minimum row (topmost position), then by minimum column (leftmost within same row) to preserve reading order (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom in original grid).
 * Normalization subtleties: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. If height > width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise to prefer landscape orientation, then re-translate. For vertical flip: Divide bounding box height in half; if bottom half has equal or more cells than top half, flip vertically (upside-down) and re-translate—this prefers "upright" or balanced shapes but can invert if bottom-heavy. For horizontal flip: In the bottom half, if more cells are on the right than left, flip horizontally (mirror left-right) and re-translate—this prefers left-heavy bottoms. Recalculate bounding box after each transformation. These flips/rotations can subtly change how shapes "face" or align, and equal-weight cases flip vertical (which might not always be desired if the puzzle expects "as-is" for balanced shapes).
 * Arrangement: Place normalized shapes side-by-side horizontally in a row, with 1-cell gaps between them (but no leading gap for the first). Use the max height across all shapes for the row height; widths add up with gaps. This creates a rectangular inner grid.
 * Border and padding: Add a thin border (size 1 in this attempt, but expected seems to use size 2 or variable) of background color around the inner grid. Then pad the entire bordered grid to a square by centering it in a larger grid of side length equal to max(outer_height, outer_width), filling extras with background—this ensures square output but can lead to oversized grids if inner arrangement is too wide/tall.
 * Grid sizing issues: Outputs must match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected 12x12, but generated 16x16; train2 expected ~20x28? but generated 32x32). Avoid over-padding or assuming fixed sizes; calculate minimally. Preserve exact cell counts and positions from normalized shapes without overlap or clipping.
 * Color preservation: Keep original colors for shapes; do not change them during normalization or placement.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have uneven shapes, multiple components per color, or shapes touching borders. Zeros are not background but empty—do not treat as shapes. If no shapes, output minimal background grid. Sorting ensures order like reading a book, which might place vertically stacked shapes in input as sequential in output.
 * Potential misses: The >=4 cell threshold works but might filter too aggressively if small shapes are intended. Horizontal arrangement assumes all fit in one row; if too wide, might need multi-row or vertical stacking (not handled here). Border size is inconsistent (attempt uses 1, but expected visuals suggest 2). Flips might over-transform (e.g., equal bottom/top flips vertical, but expected might keep original orientation). Padding centers but can create uneven borders if dimensions differ oddly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it correctly identifies background via frequency and extracts components using flood fill with size filter and sorting by position, which isolates main shapes in order.
 * Normalization functions (translate, bounding box, heaviness checks, flips, rotate) are conceptually helpful for standardizing shapes but produce incorrect orientations/flips in outputs (e.g., shapes appear inverted or mirrored compared to expected, possibly due to flipping on equal weights or unnecessary rotations).
 * Horizontal arrangement with gaps works in theory but fails in practice: shapes are placed but with wrong spacing (no gaps in some expected), leading to oversized inner grids; train1 places only partial/wrong shapes (e.g., only 3's visible, missing 8/1), train2 crams multiple shapes into one area without proper separation.
 * Border addition (size 1) and padding to square are implemented but wrong: uses border=1 (expected visuals suggest 2), and padding over-expands (e.g., train1 to 16x16 vs expected 12x12; train2 to 32x32 vs ~20x28; test to ~50x50 vs likely smaller compact square), centering but creating too much empty space.
 * arrange_shapes_horizontal adds +1 gaps between shapes (including after last?), inflating width unnecessarily—expected has tighter packing without consistent gaps.
 * place_shape is basic and correct for overlaying but clips if out-of-bounds (not an issue here).
 * Overall, extraction and normalization are partially working (shapes are detected), but transformation rules are too aggressive/subtle mismatches (e.g., unknown why train1 only shows 3's, perhaps extraction missed colors or sorting failed); arrangement/bordering/padding bloat the grid size and misplace elements.
 * Function add_border is helpful but needs adjustable size (try 2); pad_to_max_dimension is relevant but over-pads—consider minimal square without centering if not needed.
 * Functions like count_cells_in_half, is_bottom_heavy, flip_vertical, count_bottom_left_right, is_bottom_right_heavy, flip_horizontal are tied to normalization and provide weight-based decisions, but may be overkill or incorrect for puzzle (e.g., expected shapes seem unrotated/unflipped in train1/2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an enormously oversized ~50x50 grid (way larger than needed) filled almost entirely with background 4's, with shapes (6,9,8,5) crammed into the bottom rows (rows 20-29) in a dense, non-arranged cluster without horizontal spacing, borders, or proper padding/centering—expected should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with shapes arranged horizontally in sorted order, thin borders, and minimal padding, preserving distinct separated positions like in training examples.
 * Shapes appear partially normalized (e.g., 9's in a block, 6's extended, 8/5 adjacent) but not translated/rotated/flipped correctly, and placement ignores order/sorting, leading to overlap or wrong adjacency; no visible borders, and excessive empty space above suggests failed inner grid calculation or padding explosion.
 * This highlights the same issues as training: over-sized output from bad arrangement + padding, incomplete shape extraction/placement (possibly missed some components or colors), and normalization not matching expected orientations (e.g., if test has tall shapes, rotation might have failed silently).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 possibly empty but backgrounds are non-zero), and the goal is to identify distinct connected shapes (blobs of the same color, excluding the background), normalize their positions and orientations to a standard form, and rearrange them into a new larger grid framed by the background color, with shapes placed in a specific spatial layout (e.g., horizontally adjacent or in rows/columns based on original positions) rather than simply stacked.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other colors represent potential shapes, but only connected components (4-connected, via flood fill) of size >=4 cells are considered "main shapes"—smaller blobs are ignored.
 * Shapes must be extracted per color, taking the largest component per color if multiple exist (as in the code's components_by_color logic).
 * Normalization involves translating the shape to (0,0) top-left, then optionally rotating 90 degrees clockwise if height >= width (to prefer wider orientations?), checking for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top half) and flipping vertically if so, then trimming empty space from top/left to re-minimize bounding box— this seems partially correct but may over-rotate or flip in ways that distort shapes relative to expected outputs.
 * Arrangement is key: the code stacks shapes vertically into a square inner canvas (summing heights, max width, padding to square), then adds a 1-cell border, but expected outputs place shapes horizontally adjacent (e.g., in example 1, 8's left, 1's middle-right, 3's bottom-right; in example 2, shapes like 4's and 6's are split across rows/columns), suggesting sorting by original min row position and placing side-by-side or in a grid layout to fit within a bordered frame matching input dimensions or expanded minimally.
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by min row of positions, which is good for vertical order, but expected seems to preserve horizontal relationships or place in original relative positions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs expand the grid (e.g., example 1 input likely 10x10 becomes 12x12 framed), with empty space filled by background; shapes don't overlap and are not rotated/flipped in ways that change their relative "up" direction—code's bottom-heavy flip may be unnecessary or wrongly applied.
 * Handle empty/whitespace: Grids may have irregular shapes; ensure no overwriting during placement.
 * Colors: Preserve original colors; background frames everything.
 * Edge cases: Multiple components per color (take largest); no shapes (return minimal bg grid); varying input sizes.
 * Puzzle rules imply preserving shape integrity—no scaling, just translation/rotation/flip for canonical form, then precise placement to match a "composed" image where shapes are juxtaposed as if "cut out" and reassembled in a new composition.

                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the most common non-zero as bg, useful for framing and exclusion.)

    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components per color.)

def extract_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:

    for r in range(rows):

                component = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                size = len(component)
                if size >= 4:
                    if color not in components_by_color or size > len(components_by_color[color][1]):
                        components_by_color[color] = (color, component)
    shapes = list(components_by_color.values())
    shapes.sort(key=lambda x: min(pr for pr, pc in x[1]))
    return shapes
```
(This is helpful for identifying and sorting largest shapes by min row, but may need adjustment to handle multiple per color or different sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2) and extracts main shapes via flood fill, ignoring small components and bg— this worked for finding the right colors and rough positions.
 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors in an input grid, normalize their positions, orientations, and shapes to a standard form (e.g., top-left aligned, possibly rotated or flipped for consistency), and then rearrange them horizontally side-by-side in a new output grid filled with the background color, ensuring the overall output is a square grid with optional bordering padding while preserving the relative internal structure of each shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the dominant color in the grid (most frequent non-zero value), but it may surround shapes or fill large areas; do not treat zero as background unless specified, and ensure shapes are only extracted if they are connected components of the same color with at least a minimum size (e.g., >=4 cells in the code, but this threshold may be arbitrary or unnecessary).
 * Shapes must be extracted via flood fill on connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right), ignoring background and other colors; small or isolated cells (<4) are skipped, which worked but may over-filter if shapes are small.
 * Normalization is crucial: translate shapes to (0,0) origin (min row/col = 0), determine bounding box height/width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise if height > width to make them landscape-oriented, flip horizontally if the bottom half has more mass on the right than left (to standardize "facing" or asymmetry), and re-normalize origin after transformations; this attempts to canonicalize shapes but fails in examples due to incorrect rotation/flipping logic (e.g., over-rotates or flips asymmetrically, leading to distorted placements).
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by minimum row position in original grid (top-to-bottom order of first appearance), which may be correct for reading order but doesn't match expected horizontal left-to-right arrangement in outputs.
 * Placement: Shapes are placed side-by-side horizontally in rows, aligned to the top of the output grid, with their normalized widths added cumulatively; add 1-cell borders top/bottom/left/right around the entire arrangement, then pad to make the output square by adding background rows/columns centered (e.g., if wider than tall, add rows in the middle); total output size should match the minimal square enclosing the bordered arrangement, but code over-pads massively (e.g., +2 borders then squaring leads to oversized grids).
 * Subtleties: Preserve exact relative positions within each shape (no stretching/compression); do not merge shapes or alter colors; output must exactly match expected dimensions and cell values, including background fills; in examples, shapes are abutted directly without gaps between them, but bordered overall; rotations/flips must ensure shapes "face" consistently (e.g., bottom-heavy or asymmetric shapes flipped to standardize); minimum shape size (>=4) skips noise but may miss valid small shapes; background identification counts only non-zero, but if all zero, defaults to 0—ensure it doesn't misidentify shapes as background.
 * Edge cases: Grids with no shapes return single background cell; varying shape sizes require dynamic max height for vertical alignment; if arrangement is taller than wide post-border, pad columns centered; test input has multiple shapes (colors 8,3,5,9,6?) that need sequential horizontal placement without distortion.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid re-processing; use deque for BFS efficiency; counter for background via frequency; handle empty grids; sorting by y-position assumes vertical scanning order, but examples suggest left-to-right or appearance order; final squaring pads symmetrically but code's half = extra//2 may off-center if odd; generated outputs show shapes concatenated horizontally but with wrong normalization (e.g., 8's block is too wide/tall, 1's misplaced), leading to non-matching dimensions (14x14 vs expected 12x12 for train1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:

                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This works well for finding the most frequent non-background color as bg, but may need adjustment if bg is zero or sparse.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of the same color, avoiding background and other shapes; use it in future attempts.)

```python
def get_h_w(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in positions)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```
(This correctly computes bounding box height/width from positions; helpful for normalization and placement sizing.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (The full function from the code is partially helpful for origin translation and basic rotation/flip, but broken in rotation logic—if h > w, it rotates but then swaps h/w incorrectly, and flip condition based on bottom-half mass is heuristic but misapplies, leading to distorted shapes; salvage the translation parts but rewrite rotation/flip.)
```
(Partially helpful for translation to (0,0) and bounding box calc, but the rotation (if h>w, rotate to landscape then flip vertically?) and flip (bottom-right > bottom-left mass) are flawed and cause mismatches; do not reuse as-is, but adapt the min_r/min_c normalization.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 for train1, 3 for train2) and extracts components via flood fill, skipping small ones (>=4 cells), which worked for finding main shapes but may be too strict.
 * Normalization attempts to standardize orientation (rotate if tall, flip if asymmetric) but fails: for train1, the 8-shape is rotated/flipped into a 4x4 block instead of expected 4-high x 4-wide with cutout; 1-shape becomes 2x2 but misplaced; 3-shape distorted to 2-high x 6-wide but wrong alignment.
 * Placement sorts shapes by min row (vertical order), then concatenates horizontally with no gaps, adds borders, and pads to square—but over-pads (e.g., train1 becomes 14x14 instead of 12x12, with shapes centered wrongly in rows 6-9 instead of rows 3-10 top-aligned); for train2, shapes are crammed into rows 12-16 with huge background overhead (28x28 vs expected ~20x20), and order wrong (1's,5's,4's,6's misplaced relative to expected vertical-ish but horizontal arrangement).
 * Train1 generated: Shapes horizontally concatenated but normalized wrongly (8's too blocky/wide, 1's shifted right, 3's bottom-heavy flip failed), dimensions oversized with borders, shapes in middle rows 6-9 with top/bottom all-bg rows; expected: 12x12, shapes top-aligned in rows 3-10, 8's left (4w), then 1's (2w), then 3's (6w max), with precise cutouts (e.g., 8's have 2-wide bottom).
 * Train2 generated: All-bg top 11 rows, shapes in 12-16 (1's left, then 5's/4's/6's distorted/wrong widths), bottom all-bg; expected: More compact ~20x20, shapes in scattered rows (e.g., 4's mid-right rows 3-8, 6's lower rows 11-16, 1's bottom rows 19-26, 5's integrated), horizontal but with vertical spacing preserved? Wait, expected seems to rearrange in appearance order horizontally per "section" but code linearizes wrongly.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken (rotation swaps h/w but positions list incorrectly, flip miscalculates mass leading to upside-down or mirrored shapes); do not use as-is.
 * Overall, component extraction essential and works, but sorting/placement/padding logic misses top-alignment, exact widths, and minimal sizing; unknown why train2 expected has shapes not strictly horizontal (e.g., 1's at bottom, 5's overlapping sections)—may need order by first appearance x-then-y, not just y.
 * Test output generated: A massive ~32x48 grid (way oversized from over-padding/squaring), mostly all 4's (bg), with shapes only in rows 18-20 (8's left long block, then 3's/5's/9's/6's concatenated but distorted: 8's 3-high x10-wide instead of structured, 9's 3-high x9-wide blocky, 6's trailing); this does not look correct—expected should be compact square (maybe 20x20+), shapes normalized and top-aligned horizontally in order of appearance (likely 8,3,5,9,6 from positions), preserving cutouts (e.g., 8's probably L or irregular, not solid; 9's stepped, 6's bar-like), with 1-cell borders and centered padding if needed, not this huge empty expanse; differences: wrong dims/shape integrity/placement, shapes merged/distorted without gaps but wrong orientations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it is an oversized rectangular-then-squared grid (~32 rows x 48 cols, padded to square?) with excessive background, shapes only in a narrow band (rows 18-20), and visible distortions (e.g., 8's as solid 10-wide bar instead of expected irregular form with holes/cutouts, 9's blocky without steps, overall not top-aligned or compact).
 * The test output is missing proper normalization (no rotation/flip to standard, leading to raw concatenated widths totaling ~40+), exact shape preservation (flood fill captures but transforms break structure), and minimal sizing (should be ~22x22 bordered square based on max h~8-10, total w~30-40, pad to square).
 * Make sure to account for multiple asymmetric shapes (e.g., 3's small, 5's/6's medium, 9's large stepped, 8's complex) by improving flip/rotate heuristics and sorting by scan order (row-major left-to-right-top-to-bottom) to handle test case; unknown why generated is so vertically centered with huge top/bottom bg, but likely from code's +2 borders then aggressive squaring without trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting connected components (blobs) of the same non-background color from an input grid, filtering out small ones (less than 4 cells), normalizing their positions to a local origin, optionally rotating them to prefer landscape orientation, sorting them by their original top-left positions, and then reassembling them into a new compact grid with a background border and padding to a square shape. The goal is to create a "catalog" or standardized rendering of the extracted shapes while preserving their identities and relative ordering, but the current approach fails in arrangement, leading to mismatched layouts compared to expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color (or 0 if none); all other colors are treated as foreground for components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and same-color; only extract those with >=4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalize each component by translating positions relative to its min_r and min_c, compute its bounding box height (h) and width (w).
 * Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if h > w (tall shapes) to make them wider, updating positions as (c, h-1-r); this prefers horizontal/landscape shapes but may alter visual orientation subtly.
 * Sort extracted shapes by original (min_r, min_c) to process in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, mimicking reading order.
 * Arrangement is critical: current horizontal side-by-side placement creates a thin strip, but expected outputs suggest a more grid-like or vertically stacked layout that preserves relative vertical positioning (e.g., top shapes above bottom ones, with horizontal alignment within rows).
 * Add a 1-cell border of background around the inner arrangement, then pad the entire grid to the nearest square (max dimension) with background, centering the content.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs have consistent sizing (e.g., 12x12 for training 1, 20x20 for training 2), implying the inner arrangement's max_h and total_w determine the final side length after border (+2) and padding.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may overlap or align in the new grid based on original relative positions, but current code ignores vertical offsets and packs everything into one row; also, rotation may misalign shapes if the puzzle expects no rotation or different rotation logic.
 * Handle empty grids or no valid components by returning a single background cell.
 * Outputs use lists of lists, with rows as lists of ints; ensure deep copies to avoid mutation.
 * Potential edge: Shapes with irregular bounding boxes (e.g., L-shapes) must fill their relative positions correctly without gaps in the new grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common non-zero color; useful for distinguishing foreground.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This performs standard 4-connected flood fill for same-color components; essential for extracting blobs accurately.)

```python
def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts and filters components >=4 cells, with min_r/min_c for sorting; core to identifying valid shapes, but note it skips background cells correctly.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    relative = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]
    h = max(r for r, _ in relative) + 1
    w = max(c for _, c in relative) + 1
    return relative, h, w
```
(This normalizes shape positions to (0,0) origin and computes tight bounding box; helpful for isolating shapes.)

```python
def rotate_if_tall(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if h <= w:
        return positions, h, w
    new_positions = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]
    new_h = w
    new_w = h
    return new_positions, new_h, new_w
```
(This rotates tall shapes to landscape; useful but may be a subtlety—puzzle might not require rotation, or it could be causing mismatches in shape orientation.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    new_h = gh + 2
    new_w = gw + 2
    new_grid = [[bg] * new_w for _ in range(new_h)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This adds a 1-cell background border; correct and necessary for framing.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    side = max(gh, gw)
    if gh == 0 or gw == 0:
        return [[bg]]
    if side == gh == gw:
        return [row[:] for row in grid]  # copy
    new_grid = [[bg] * side for _ in range(side)]
    offset_r = (side - gh) // 2
    offset_c = (side - gw) // 2
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[offset_r + i][offset_c + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This centers and pads to square with background; works well but amplifies issues if inner grid is imbalanced.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters components (>=4 cells), normalizes positions, and applies optional rotation, but fails in sorting and arrangement: shapes are sorted by (min_r, min_c) but placed horizontally side-by-side in a single row, creating a thin inner grid (e.g., height ~2-4, wide total_w), leading to many empty rows after bordering and square-padding.
 * For training example 1: Generated a 14x14 grid with all shapes crammed into rows 5-8 (8's left, 1's middle, 3's right, but misaligned and no vertical separation), surrounded by 2's border and top/bottom padding; expected is 12x12 with 8's top-left (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1's top-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9), 3's bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 8-13, horizontal), preserving vertical ordering and compactness—generated mismatches by flattening to one row and oversized padding.
 * For training example 2: Generated a 28x28 grid (way oversized) with 10+ empty rows top/bottom, shapes crammed into rows 11-16 (1's left, 5's scattered, 4's/6's middle-right, but jumbled and no grid structure); expected is 20x20 with shapes in a multi-row layout (4's/5's top-middle rows 2-7, 6's middle rows 10-15, 1's bottom rows 18-25, with vertical stacking and horizontal alignment within "rows" of shapes)—generated differs by horizontal packing, wrong size, and poor alignment (e.g., 1's and 5's fragmented).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order but doesn't account for vertical grouping; build_inner_grid is broken for multi-row arrangements—needs to place shapes in rows based on original min_r buckets or similar.
 * Rotation may be unhelpful or incorrect: e.g., in training 1, 3's is horizontal in expected but might be rotated if tall; don't use if it distorts expected shapes.
 * Flood_fill and extract_raw_components are essential and correct for component detection; translate_to_origin is helpful for normalization.
 * add_border and pad_to_square are correct but highlight arrangement flaws (e.g., thin inner -> empty square).
 * Overall, extraction works (shapes identified correctly), but rearrangement doesn't mimic the expected "poster" or "inventory" layout with vertical stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it's a massive ~48x48? grid (inferred from 48 elements per row) mostly filled with background 4's (empty rows 0-16 and 20-47), with shapes crammed into only rows 17-19 (8's left spanning multiple rows but flattened, 3's/5's/9's/6's jumbled horizontally without vertical separation or alignment, e.g., 8's block rows 17-19 cols 1-9, then scattered smaller blobs like 3's at cols 10-12, 5's at 13-21, etc., ending with 6's right).
 * It differs from what we'd expect (based on training): should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with extracted shapes (8,3,5,9,6 colors visible) arranged in a multi-row grid layout (e.g., larger 8's block top, smaller ones below/right, bordered by 4's, centered), preserving relative original positions vertically; instead, horizontal cramming creates imbalance, no stacking (all in 3 rows), and excessive empty space, suggesting the same arrangement bug as training examples.
 * Shapes seem extracted correctly (e.g., large 8's, 9's block, 6's), but placement ignores vertical offsets—e.g., if test has vertically separated shapes, they should stack, not inline; rotation might have flipped some (unknown if needed).
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too sparse/empty, mismatched size, no visual "catalog" structure; likely fails if test expects similar to training 2's stacked layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains a background color and multiple connected components (shapes) of different colors, and the goal is to extract the "main" shapes (likely those with sufficient size, e.g., >=4 cells), normalize their position and orientation in a canonical way (translating to top-left, possibly rotating/flipping for consistency), and then reassemble them into a new output grid with the same background, arranged in a structured layout (e.g., sorted by original position or color, possibly stacked vertically with borders or spacing to match the expected compositions).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Extract only "main" shapes: Connected components of the same color, excluding the background (identified as the most frequent non-zero color), and filter to those with at least 4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalization is crucial but tricky: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; ensure consistent orientation by rotating clockwise if height > width (to prefer landscape), always flipping vertically (to prefer "upright" or top-heavy?), and conditionally flipping horizontally if the shape is "bottom-right heavy" (more cells in bottom-right quadrant than bottom-left, to prefer left-leaning or balanced asymmetry).
 * Arrangement rules: Shapes should be placed in the output in the order they appear when scanned top-to-bottom, left-to-right (based on the minimum row/col of the component), but stacked vertically rather than horizontally; include spacing or gaps (e.g., 1-2 cells of background) between shapes, and add a uniform border (thickness 2) around the entire composition; the inner grid height should accommodate the tallest shape, but the overall layout expands vertically for multiple shapes.
 * Background handling: Correctly identify as the most common non-zero color (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2, 4 in test); fill all non-shape areas with it; do not treat 0 as background if non-zero colors dominate.
 * Sorting and placement subtleties: After extraction, sort components by their original top-left position (min row, then min col); place each normalized shape at increasing y-positions (vertical stacking) with x-offsets to align left or center; ensure bounding boxes don't overlap and gaps prevent merging; in ex1, the 8-shape is placed highest, 1-shape mid-right, 3-shape lowest-right, suggesting vertical progression with horizontal offsets based on original relative positions.
 * Size and padding: Output should match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., ex1: 12 rows x 12 cols inner? but with border; ex2 taller with more vertical space); add border after inner composition; if no shapes, return a single bg cell.
 * Easy-to-miss elements: Shapes may have irregular forms (e.g., L-shapes or protrusions in ex1's 8 and 3); normalization flips/rotations must preserve connectivity and color but can alter visual "up" direction—over-flipping leads to mismatches (e.g., 3-shape in ex1 appears "upside-down" or mirrored in generated); original positions influence order/placement (not just color); small shapes (<4 cells) are ignored, but in ex2, some 1's and 5's seem split or partial.
 * General: Grids are rectangular; use 4-directional connectivity for flood-fill; handle empty/zero grids gracefully.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent non-zero color; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Flood-fill for connected components; essential and works correctly for extracting same-color blobs.)

```python
def extract_all_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    components.append((color, comp))
    components.sort(key=lambda x: (min(rr for rr, _ in x[1]), min(cc for _, cc in x[1])))
    return components
```
(Extracts and sorts main shapes by original top-left position; very helpful, correctly filters small components and orders by scan order.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not positions:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]

def get_bounding_box(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1
```
(Translation and bounding box utilities; core to normalization, work well but need integration with correct rotation/flip logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters main shapes (>=4 cells), sorts them by original position, and normalizes via translation/rotation/flip, but arranges them horizontally side-by-side with fixed gaps (1 cell), leading to wide, short grids instead of vertical stacking.
 * Train 1 generated a compact 8x18 grid (after border?) with 8-shape left, 1-shape mid, 3-shape right, all at similar heights (rows 2-5), but expected is 12x12 with vertical separation: 8-shape top (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1-shape mid-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9 but lower effective), empty space below 8, then 3-shape bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 4-9 and 8-11); difference: horizontal vs. vertical layout, no vertical spacing, and possible flip mismatch on 3-shape (appears shifted right in generated).
 * Train 2 generated a messy 10x34 horizontal jumble with shapes overlapping or poorly spaced (e.g., 1's and 5's mixed left, 4's and 6's mid-right, extra 5's/6's duplicated?), but expected is ~18x20 with vertical sections: upper 4's/5's stacked, mid 6's horizontal, lower 1's vertical with 5's right; differences: extreme width from horizontal placement, incorrect sorting/placement (e.g., 1's appear low but should be bottom, 5's duplicated or mispositioned), and border adds uneven padding; unknown why some shapes like 5's are split or extra in generated.
 * Normalization flips (always vertical, conditional horizontal) may over-correct, causing shape orientations to mismatch expected (e.g., 3 in ex1 looks "flipped" horizontally in generated vs. expected left-aligned); rotation only if h>w works but doesn't handle all asymmetries.
 * Arrangement uses max height for inner grid but places all at y=0 with x-offsets, ignoring vertical progression; should instead accumulate height with per-shape y-offsets based on order.
 * add_border is helpful and correct (thickness=2, pads uniformly), but applied to wrong inner layout.
 * is_bottom_right_heavy and flip functions are somewhat helpful for asymmetry but may be too aggressive—consider optional or rule-based (e.g., only if > certain imbalance threshold).
 * Overall, extraction/sorting is strong (shapes identified correctly), but layout is the core failure; no unhelpful functions, but the full program() integrates poorly (e.g., current_x accumulation assumes horizontal).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an extremely wide ~13x51 grid (after border) with all shapes (8,3,5,9,6, etc.) crammed horizontally in a single band (mostly rows 2-11), with some vertical extent for taller shapes like 8/9/6 but no true stacking—e.g., 8-shape left tall, then 3/5/9/6 clustered mid-right, all at similar heights with minimal gaps, leading to a linear "strip" composition.
 * It mismatches expected logic from trainings, which use vertical stacking with offsets (e.g., shapes at increasing y-positions, horizontal shifts for alignment); here, everything is side-by-side, causing overlaps or squeezes (e.g., 9-shape protrudes but not separated vertically from 6); border is added correctly, but inner layout is wrong—test likely needs taller grid with shapes like 8 top, 3/5 mid, 9/6 bottom, sorted by original positions, preserving relative x-offsets from input.
 * Does not make sense: Too horizontal and compact, ignores vertical order from extraction sort; possible normalization issues (e.g., 8-shape rotated wrong, appearing stretched); extra bg fills but no spacing between sections.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from a grid, normalizing their orientation and position to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips based on heuristics like bottom-heaviness or right-heaviness), sorting them by original position, and then rearranging them into a new bordered grid with the background color, likely in a packed row-based layout to simulate a "catalog" or standardized display of the shapes while preserving their normalized forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all empty spaces in the output use this.
 * Extract only connected components (4-connected, same color) with at least 4 cells; ignore smaller blobs or single cells.
 * Components must be flood-filled correctly to capture full shapes, even irregular ones like L-shapes or those with protrusions.
 * Normalization is critical: translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; if height > width, rotate 90° clockwise; check for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top) and flip vertically if so (especially after rotation); check for "bottom-right heavy" (in bottom half, more cells on right than left) and flip horizontally if so; re-translate after each transform to keep origin at (0,0).
 * Sorting: Components are sorted by their original minimum row and column (top-left position in source grid), which determines arrangement order.
 * Arrangement: Pack shapes into rows on a new canvas; use a capacity limit (e.g., max_width + max_height of shapes) to decide when to start a new row; add horizontal gaps (e.g., 2 units) between shapes in a row, vertical gaps (e.g., 0) between rows; align shapes left-to-right in rows, top-to-bottom for rows; compute total canvas size based on max row dimensions.
 * Border: Add a uniform border (thickness 2) of background color around the arranged inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations/flips must update bounding box dimensions correctly after each step; "heaviness" checks only apply if height/width >1; arrangement may need to align shapes to a baseline (e.g., bottom-aligned in rows?) or handle varying heights without vertical centering; original positions influence order but not final placement beyond sorting; ensure no overlaps or out-of-bounds writes; the expected outputs show shapes in "canonical" orientations that look standardized (e.g., L-shapes opening rightward or downward), suggesting normalization is key but may need additional rules like preferring certain rotations.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must respect grid bounds and only same-color cells; normalization can chain (e.g., rotate then flip, re-check heaviness); packing may fail if capacity is miscalculated (e.g., too small, causing unnecessary row breaks); shapes like partial rectangles or hooks (e.g., the 3's L-shape) get flipped to a consistent form, but if flips are wrong, they appear mirrored or rotated incorrectly in output; border thickness is fixed at 2, and canvas must be exactly sized to fit with border.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it handles extraction and normalization partially; issues in packing lead to misaligned rows (e.g., shapes starting at wrong x-offsets); test case has multiple rows of shapes (8,5,9,6 with small 3's), suggesting need for multi-row packing without excessive gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common non-zero color; useful and accurate.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This performs standard 4-connected flood-fill for same-color components; essential and works well for extracting shapes.)

```python
def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts components >=4 cells, ignoring bg and small blobs; very helpful, sorts later by min_r/min_c; accurate for identifying objects.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not positions:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]

def get_bounding_box(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1

def rotate_90_cw(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]

def flip_vertical(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(h - 1 - r, c) for r, c in positions]

def flip_horizontal(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(r, w - 1 - c) for r, c in positions]
```
(These handle translation, bounding box, and basic transforms; core to normalization and work correctly individually, but chaining in normalize_shape needs fixes for re-translation and re-bounding after each step.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    rotated = False
    if h > w:
        positions = rotate_90_cw(positions, h, w)
        rotated = True
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    do_v_flip = rotated or is_bottom_heavy(positions, h)
    if do_v_flip:
        positions = flip_vertical(positions, h)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    if is_bottom_right_heavy(positions, h, w):
        positions = flip_horizontal(positions, w)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    return color, positions
```
(This attempts full normalization but is buggy: is_bottom_heavy and is_bottom_right_heavy definitions may be incorrect—bottom_heavy counts top vs bottom but doesn't specify "heavy" threshold clearly; bottom_right_heavy only checks bottom half and compares left/right counts strictly (>); vertical flip condition ties to rotation oddly; doesn't handle multiple rotations or full 360° normalization; re-bounding after flips is good but heaviness checks may need to be recursive or more robust for irregular shapes.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], thickness: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg for _ in range(nw)] for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This correctly adds a fixed-thickness border; helpful and accurate.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided, but it successfully extracts components (e.g., identifies 8,1,3 in train1 and various in train2/test), normalizes positions to origin, and adds border correctly.
 * What worked: Background detection, flood-fill extraction (captures full shapes >=4 cells), translation to origin, basic rotation/flip mechanics, sorting by original min_r/min_c, and border addition; the inner grid filling avoids overlaps.
 * What didn't work: Normalization heuristics are incomplete—e.g., in train1, the 3-shape (likely an L or hook) isn't flipped/rotated to match expected (generated places it as a left-aligned partial rectangle in row 6-9 cols 6-9, but expected has it right-shifted in row 6-7 cols 8-9 and full in row 8-9 cols 4-9, suggesting wrong canonical orientation); in train2, multiple shapes (1,5,4,6) are packed incorrectly (generated spreads them across rows with wrong alignments, e.g., 1's left then 5's right, but expected groups 4's large in middle-right, 5's small left, 6's bottom, 1's bottom-left with extensions).
 * Arrangement/packing is the main failure: Uses capacity = max_w + max_h (e.g., ~8 for squares), gap_h=2, but breaks rows too early or left-aligns without matching expected offsets (e.g., train1 generated puts 3's at col 6, expected at col 4-9 with gap; train2 generated has vertical stacking issues, e.g., 4's split across rows wrongly); no vertical alignment within rows (shapes may need bottom-alignment); total canvas sizing pads correctly but positions don't match.
 * Sorting works (order seems 8 then 1 then 3 in train1, matching original positions), but downstream packing ignores subtle spacing (e.g., expected has larger gaps or fixed columns).
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is broken/not helpful: Capacity logic causes poor packing (e.g., fits 8+1 in row1 but 3 alone in row2 left-aligned; train2 overflows rows wrongly); gaps are asymmetric (h=2, v=0); doesn't compute max row width correctly for centering or right-alignment; suggest replacing with fixed-grid or better knapsack-style packing.
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is partially helpful but flawed: Simple half-split count works for symmetric cases but fails for irregulars (e.g., L-shapes may not trigger flip correctly; threshold is >= but may need > or weighted center-of-mass).
 * Function `is_bottom_right_heavy` similar issue: Only bottom-half check is good, but strict > count may miss balanced-but-skewed shapes; applied too late in chain.
 * Overall, extraction/normalization gets ~70% right (shapes identifiable), but transform logic and packing need overhaul for orientations and layout to match expected standardized arrangements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it rearranges shapes (large 8/9/5/6 blocks, small 3's) into a multi-row packed grid with border 4, but the layout is misaligned similar to trainings—e.g., 8's top-left spanning rows 2-10 cols 2-11, small 3's awkwardly next to it in rows 2-4 cols 12-15, then 5's below in rows 11-20 with internal structure (suggesting partial normalization of a complex shape), 9's mid-right rows 20-28, 6's bottom rows 29-38; this seems like linear left-to-right packing with row breaks, but expected likely needs better canonical orientations (e.g., all "bottom-left" aligned L's or hooks) and tighter/spaced rows matching original relative positions or a grid-like catalog (e.g., sorted into 2-3 per row with even spacing); small 3's are repeated/clustered oddly, possibly from extraction error or no deduping; overall, it "makes sense" as an attempt at rearrangement but fails subtlety like train cases (wrong flips cause 5/9/6 to appear stretched vertically/horizontally; packing capacity too loose, leading to tall thin canvas instead of compact); to handle test, need to refine heaviness to prefer "opening right/down" for hooks, increase gap_h to 3-4 for alignment, and ensure post-transform bounding boxes trigger correct row heights.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 02:41:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from an input grid, normalize each shape's position and orientation to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips), and then rearrange them into a new grid layout with rows of shapes, gaps between them, centered alignment per row, and a bordered background. The output preserves the original colors and connected structure but standardizes the composition for consistency across inputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most common non-zero color as background (bg); ignore all bg cells during extraction, but do not extract components of the bg color itself even if connected.
 * Shape extraction: Only extract 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same color with size >=4 cells; smaller blobs or single cells are ignored as noise. Sort extracted components by their top-left position (min row, then min col) before processing.
 * Normalization process: Translate all positions to origin (0,0); compute bounding box (h=height, w=width); rotate 90° CW repeatedly until h <= w (track rotations for later flips); for vertical flip decision, count cells in top vs. bottom half—if rotations even and bottom heavier, or rotations odd and top heavier, flip vertically; after vertical flip (if any), check bottom half's left vs. right mass—if right heavier, flip horizontally. This ensures a "standard" orientation minimizing asymmetry.
 * Layout arrangement: After normalization, sort shapes implicitly by extraction order (which is position-based); place into rows where each row's max width is max(h+w across shapes) + gaps; start new row if adding next shape exceeds row width; add gap=2 between shapes in row; center each row by shifting left-aligned content; stack rows vertically with no vertical gaps; final inner grid size based on max row width and total height; add thickness=2 border of bg around the entire inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations affect flip logic (even/odd parity changes vertical mass interpretation); bounding box updates after each transform; components must be exactly same-color connected (flood-fill stops at color mismatch); output grid must match exact dimensions and positions—no extra bg inside shapes or overlaps; preserve original colors (do not remap); if no valid shapes, output single bg cell; extraction skips visited cells to avoid reprocessing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with all bg or tiny shapes return minimal bg grid; shapes touching border or each other are still separate if different colors; normalization can change effective h/w; horizontal flip only after vertical to avoid over-correction; sorting by min position ensures consistent order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter(cell for row in g for cell in row if cell != 0)
    return counts.most_common(1)[0][0] if counts else 0
```
(Helpful for reliably detecting bg as the dominant non-zero color; assumes no zero-cells as bg.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Essential for extracting exact connected components of a single color; uses BFS for efficiency and 4-connectivity.)

```python
def extract_all_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    components.append((color, comp))
    components.sort(key=lambda x: (min(rr for rr, _ in x[1]), min(cc for _, cc in x[1])))
    return components
```
(Core extraction function; filters small shapes, sorts by top-left for canonical order—very helpful for reproducible processing.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:

    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]

def get_bounding_box(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1

def rotate_90_cw(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:

def flip_vertical(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(h - 1 - r, c) for r, c in positions]

def flip_horizontal(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(r, w - 1 - c) for r, c in positions]

def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    rotations = 0
    while h > w:
        positions = rotate_90_cw(positions, h, w)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
        rotations += 1
    def count_top_bottom(hh):
        half = hh // 2
        top = sum(1 for r, _ in positions if r < half)
        bottom = len(positions) - top
        return top, bottom
    top, bottom = count_top_bottom(h)
    flip_v = False
    if rotations % 2 == 0:
        if bottom >= top:
            flip_v = True
    else:
        if top >= bottom:
            flip_v = True
    if flip_v:
        positions = flip_vertical(positions, h)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    def count_bottom_lr(hh, ww):
        half_r = hh // 2
        half_c = ww // 2
        bl = sum(1 for r, c in positions if r >= half_r and c < half_c)
        br = sum(1 for r, c in positions if r >= half_r and c >= half_c)
        return bl, br
    bl, br = count_bottom_lr(h, w)
    if br > bl:
        positions = flip_horizontal(positions, w)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    return color, positions
```
(These form the normalization pipeline; critical for standardizing shapes—translate, rotate until h<=w, conditional flips based on mass distribution. The vertical flip logic depends on rotation parity, which is a subtle but key detail.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], thickness: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg] * nw for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(Helpful for final bordering; ensures consistent padding around the composed inner grid.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core extraction, normalization, and layout logic works for simple cases with fewer shapes or standard orientations.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated output has incorrect shape ordering/placement (e.g., shape 1 appears in top-middle but expected at bottom; shape 5 misplaced to right of 1 instead of left; shape 4's wide bar is split and lower than expected; shape 6's L-shape is rotated/flipped wrong, appearing as a vertical stack instead of horizontal with extension). Dimensions mismatch (generated 20x16 inner? vs expected 20x20 with more even spacing); rows not centered properly (e.g., expected has centered 4-bar spanning most width, but generated has it offset); vertical stacking has extra empty rows or misaligned heights.
 * Normalization likely over-rotates or misapplies flips in training 2 (e.g., shape 4's horizontal bar becomes vertical in generated; shape 1's partial square not flipped to match expected orientation); extraction sorts correctly but layout row-breaking fails when shapes have varying h/w post-normalization.
 * Layout uses max_row_w = max_h + max_w, but this assumes single-shape rows—fails when multiple small shapes fit but code breaks rows prematurely; gap=2 is applied but centering shift = total_w - row_used_w doesn't account for gaps in used_w calc.
 * extract_all_main_shapes is helpful and correct (properly filters >=4, sorts); flood_fill is solid (no leaks across colors).
 * The full program() integrates everything but has bugs in row packing (current_x += sw + gap overflows incorrectly) and inner_grid filling (abs_x = shift + local_x ignores gaps in placement, causing overlaps or shifts).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though normalize_shape's flip conditions may need tuning for asymmetric shapes like L's or partial bars.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It extracts 5+ shapes (colors 3,5,6,8,9) with bg=4, but arrangement is a tall vertical stack (32x18?) with shapes in columns rather than rows—e.g., multiple horizontal bars (8,9) stacked directly, small protrusions like 3's on right of some bars suggest poor normalization (possibly unflipped or unrotated, as 3's look like detached arms); shape 5's complex form (looks like a plus or cross with extensions) spans unevenly, indicating failed bounding/translate after flips; no visible gaps between shapes in "rows," and centering absent (left-heavy alignment); border thickness=2 is applied but inner content overflows or misaligns (e.g., 5's bottom extensions hit border unevenly).
 * Compared to expected (inferred from pattern/rules): Should have shapes normalized (e.g., all bars horizontal with h<=w, L-shapes standardized to bottom-left heavy), sorted by original top-left, packed into 2-3 rows with gap=2 and centering (wider rows like 8/9 bars spanning full width), total inner ~20-24 high x max_row_w wide, no vertical stacking without row breaks—current output mashes everything vertically, missing the row-based horizontal composition.
 * Test highlights normalization issues for tall/thin shapes (e.g., 5 and 6 seem rotated wrong, as their extensions are vertical instead of balanced); layout bug amplified here with more shapes, causing no row breaks (current_x never exceeds due to small sw post-norm?); extraction seems to catch all >=4 (good), but order wrong (e.g., 8 before 3, but 3's small position should sort earlier).

[2025-10-01 02:41:09] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify the background color, extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors that meet a minimum size threshold, normalize each shape's orientation and position through translations, rotations, and flips to standardize their appearance (e.g., making them "bottom-left justified" based on weight distribution), and then rearrange these normalized shapes into a new compact grid arranged horizontally in the order they appear in the original grid (sorted by top-left position), with added borders and padding to form a square output grid while preserving the original colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most frequent non-zero color as background; ignore zeros and treat them as empty/transparent, but ensure extraction skips background entirely.
 * Shape extraction: Only consider 4-connected (up/down/left/right) components of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise should be omitted. Sort extracted shapes by their minimum row (topmost position), then by minimum column (leftmost within same row) to preserve reading order (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom in original grid).
 * Normalization subtleties: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. If height > width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise to prefer landscape orientation, then re-translate. For vertical flip: Divide bounding box height in half; if bottom half has equal or more cells than top half, flip vertically (upside-down) and re-translate—this prefers "upright" or balanced shapes but can invert if bottom-heavy. For horizontal flip: In the bottom half, if more cells are on the right than left, flip horizontally (mirror left-right) and re-translate—this prefers left-heavy bottoms. Recalculate bounding box after each transformation. These flips/rotations can subtly change how shapes "face" or align, and equal-weight cases flip vertical (which might not always be desired if the puzzle expects "as-is" for balanced shapes).
 * Arrangement: Place normalized shapes side-by-side horizontally in a row, with 1-cell gaps between them (but no leading gap for the first). Use the max height across all shapes for the row height; widths add up with gaps. This creates a rectangular inner grid.
 * Border and padding: Add a thin border (size 1 in this attempt, but expected seems to use size 2 or variable) of background color around the inner grid. Then pad the entire bordered grid to a square by centering it in a larger grid of side length equal to max(outer_height, outer_width), filling extras with background—this ensures square output but can lead to oversized grids if inner arrangement is too wide/tall.
 * Grid sizing issues: Outputs must match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected 12x12, but generated 16x16; train2 expected ~20x28? but generated 32x32). Avoid over-padding or assuming fixed sizes; calculate minimally. Preserve exact cell counts and positions from normalized shapes without overlap or clipping.
 * Color preservation: Keep original colors for shapes; do not change them during normalization or placement.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have uneven shapes, multiple components per color, or shapes touching borders. Zeros are not background but empty—do not treat as shapes. If no shapes, output minimal background grid. Sorting ensures order like reading a book, which might place vertically stacked shapes in input as sequential in output.
 * Potential misses: The >=4 cell threshold works but might filter too aggressively if small shapes are intended. Horizontal arrangement assumes all fit in one row; if too wide, might need multi-row or vertical stacking (not handled here). Border size is inconsistent (attempt uses 1, but expected visuals suggest 2). Flips might over-transform (e.g., equal bottom/top flips vertical, but expected might keep original orientation). Padding centers but can create uneven borders if dimensions differ oddly.

        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    return color, positions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it correctly identifies background via frequency and extracts components using flood fill with size filter and sorting by position, which isolates main shapes in order.
 * Normalization functions (translate, bounding box, heaviness checks, flips, rotate) are conceptually helpful for standardizing shapes but produce incorrect orientations/flips in outputs (e.g., shapes appear inverted or mirrored compared to expected, possibly due to flipping on equal weights or unnecessary rotations).
 * Horizontal arrangement with gaps works in theory but fails in practice: shapes are placed but with wrong spacing (no gaps in some expected), leading to oversized inner grids; train1 places only partial/wrong shapes (e.g., only 3's visible, missing 8/1), train2 crams multiple shapes into one area without proper separation.
 * Border addition (size 1) and padding to square are implemented but wrong: uses border=1 (expected visuals suggest 2), and padding over-expands (e.g., train1 to 16x16 vs expected 12x12; train2 to 32x32 vs ~20x28; test to ~50x50 vs likely smaller compact square), centering but creating too much empty space.
 * arrange_shapes_horizontal adds +1 gaps between shapes (including after last?), inflating width unnecessarily—expected has tighter packing without consistent gaps.
 * place_shape is basic and correct for overlaying but clips if out-of-bounds (not an issue here).
 * Overall, extraction and normalization are partially working (shapes are detected), but transformation rules are too aggressive/subtle mismatches (e.g., unknown why train1 only shows 3's, perhaps extraction missed colors or sorting failed); arrangement/bordering/padding bloat the grid size and misplace elements.
 * Function add_border is helpful but needs adjustable size (try 2); pad_to_max_dimension is relevant but over-pads—consider minimal square without centering if not needed.
 * Functions like count_cells_in_half, is_bottom_heavy, flip_vertical, count_bottom_left_right, is_bottom_right_heavy, flip_horizontal are tied to normalization and provide weight-based decisions, but may be overkill or incorrect for puzzle (e.g., expected shapes seem unrotated/unflipped in train1/2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an enormously oversized ~50x50 grid (way larger than needed) filled almost entirely with background 4's, with shapes (6,9,8,5) crammed into the bottom rows (rows 20-29) in a dense, non-arranged cluster without horizontal spacing, borders, or proper padding/centering—expected should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with shapes arranged horizontally in sorted order, thin borders, and minimal padding, preserving distinct separated positions like in training examples.
 * Shapes appear partially normalized (e.g., 9's in a block, 6's extended, 8/5 adjacent) but not translated/rotated/flipped correctly, and placement ignores order/sorting, leading to overlap or wrong adjacency; no visible borders, and excessive empty space above suggests failed inner grid calculation or padding explosion.
 * This highlights the same issues as training: over-sized output from bad arrangement + padding, incomplete shape extraction/placement (possibly missed some components or colors), and normalization not matching expected orientations (e.g., if test has tall shapes, rotation might have failed silently).

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 possibly empty but backgrounds are non-zero), and the goal is to identify distinct connected shapes (blobs of the same color, excluding the background), normalize their positions and orientations to a standard form, and rearrange them into a new larger grid framed by the background color, with shapes placed in a specific spatial layout (e.g., horizontally adjacent or in rows/columns based on original positions) rather than simply stacked.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other colors represent potential shapes, but only connected components (4-connected, via flood fill) of size >=4 cells are considered "main shapes"—smaller blobs are ignored.
 * Shapes must be extracted per color, taking the largest component per color if multiple exist (as in the code's components_by_color logic).
 * Normalization involves translating the shape to (0,0) top-left, then optionally rotating 90 degrees clockwise if height >= width (to prefer wider orientations?), checking for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top half) and flipping vertically if so, then trimming empty space from top/left to re-minimize bounding box— this seems partially correct but may over-rotate or flip in ways that distort shapes relative to expected outputs.
 * Arrangement is key: the code stacks shapes vertically into a square inner canvas (summing heights, max width, padding to square), then adds a 1-cell border, but expected outputs place shapes horizontally adjacent (e.g., in example 1, 8's left, 1's middle-right, 3's bottom-right; in example 2, shapes like 4's and 6's are split across rows/columns), suggesting sorting by original min row position and placing side-by-side or in a grid layout to fit within a bordered frame matching input dimensions or expanded minimally.
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by min row of positions, which is good for vertical order, but expected seems to preserve horizontal relationships or place in original relative positions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs expand the grid (e.g., example 1 input likely 10x10 becomes 12x12 framed), with empty space filled by background; shapes don't overlap and are not rotated/flipped in ways that change their relative "up" direction—code's bottom-heavy flip may be unnecessary or wrongly applied.
 * Handle empty/whitespace: Grids may have irregular shapes; ensure no overwriting during placement.
 * Colors: Preserve original colors; background frames everything.
 * Edge cases: Multiple components per color (take largest); no shapes (return minimal bg grid); varying input sizes.
 * Puzzle rules imply preserving shape integrity—no scaling, just translation/rotation/flip for canonical form, then precise placement to match a "composed" image where shapes are juxtaposed as if "cut out" and reassembled in a new composition.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the most common non-zero as bg, useful for framing and exclusion.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components per color.)

```python
def extract_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components_by_color = {}
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                size = len(component)
                if size >= 4:
                    if color not in components_by_color or size > len(components_by_color[color][1]):
                        components_by_color[color] = (color, component)
    shapes = list(components_by_color.values())
    shapes.sort(key=lambda x: min(pr for pr, pc in x[1]))
    return shapes
```
(This is helpful for identifying and sorting largest shapes by min row, but may need adjustment to handle multiple per color or different sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2) and extracts main shapes via flood fill, ignoring small components and bg— this worked for finding the right colors and rough positions.
 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors in an input grid, normalize their positions, orientations, and shapes to a standard form (e.g., top-left aligned, possibly rotated or flipped for consistency), and then rearrange them horizontally side-by-side in a new output grid filled with the background color, ensuring the overall output is a square grid with optional bordering padding while preserving the relative internal structure of each shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the dominant color in the grid (most frequent non-zero value), but it may surround shapes or fill large areas; do not treat zero as background unless specified, and ensure shapes are only extracted if they are connected components of the same color with at least a minimum size (e.g., >=4 cells in the code, but this threshold may be arbitrary or unnecessary).
 * Shapes must be extracted via flood fill on connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right), ignoring background and other colors; small or isolated cells (<4) are skipped, which worked but may over-filter if shapes are small.
 * Normalization is crucial: translate shapes to (0,0) origin (min row/col = 0), determine bounding box height/width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise if height > width to make them landscape-oriented, flip horizontally if the bottom half has more mass on the right than left (to standardize "facing" or asymmetry), and re-normalize origin after transformations; this attempts to canonicalize shapes but fails in examples due to incorrect rotation/flipping logic (e.g., over-rotates or flips asymmetrically, leading to distorted placements).
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by minimum row position in original grid (top-to-bottom order of first appearance), which may be correct for reading order but doesn't match expected horizontal left-to-right arrangement in outputs.
 * Placement: Shapes are placed side-by-side horizontally in rows, aligned to the top of the output grid, with their normalized widths added cumulatively; add 1-cell borders top/bottom/left/right around the entire arrangement, then pad to make the output square by adding background rows/columns centered (e.g., if wider than tall, add rows in the middle); total output size should match the minimal square enclosing the bordered arrangement, but code over-pads massively (e.g., +2 borders then squaring leads to oversized grids).
 * Subtleties: Preserve exact relative positions within each shape (no stretching/compression); do not merge shapes or alter colors; output must exactly match expected dimensions and cell values, including background fills; in examples, shapes are abutted directly without gaps between them, but bordered overall; rotations/flips must ensure shapes "face" consistently (e.g., bottom-heavy or asymmetric shapes flipped to standardize); minimum shape size (>=4) skips noise but may miss valid small shapes; background identification counts only non-zero, but if all zero, defaults to 0—ensure it doesn't misidentify shapes as background.
 * Edge cases: Grids with no shapes return single background cell; varying shape sizes require dynamic max height for vertical alignment; if arrangement is taller than wide post-border, pad columns centered; test input has multiple shapes (colors 8,3,5,9,6?) that need sequential horizontal placement without distortion.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid re-processing; use deque for BFS efficiency; counter for background via frequency; handle empty grids; sorting by y-position assumes vertical scanning order, but examples suggest left-to-right or appearance order; final squaring pads symmetrically but code's half = extra//2 may off-center if odd; generated outputs show shapes concatenated horizontally but with wrong normalization (e.g., 8's block is too wide/tall, 1's misplaced), leading to non-matching dimensions (14x14 vs expected 12x12 for train1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This works well for finding the most frequent non-background color as bg, but may need adjustment if bg is zero or sparse.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of the same color, avoiding background and other shapes; use it in future attempts.)

```python
def get_h_w(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in positions)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```
(This correctly computes bounding box height/width from positions; helpful for normalization and placement sizing.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (The full function from the code is partially helpful for origin translation and basic rotation/flip, but broken in rotation logic—if h > w, it rotates but then swaps h/w incorrectly, and flip condition based on bottom-half mass is heuristic but misapplies, leading to distorted shapes; salvage the translation parts but rewrite rotation/flip.)
```
(Partially helpful for translation to (0,0) and bounding box calc, but the rotation (if h>w, rotate to landscape then flip vertically?) and flip (bottom-right > bottom-left mass) are flawed and cause mismatches; do not reuse as-is, but adapt the min_r/min_c normalization.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 for train1, 3 for train2) and extracts components via flood fill, skipping small ones (>=4 cells), which worked for finding main shapes but may be too strict.
 * Normalization attempts to standardize orientation (rotate if tall, flip if asymmetric) but fails: for train1, the 8-shape is rotated/flipped into a 4x4 block instead of expected 4-high x 4-wide with cutout; 1-shape becomes 2x2 but misplaced; 3-shape distorted to 2-high x 6-wide but wrong alignment.
 * Placement sorts shapes by min row (vertical order), then concatenates horizontally with no gaps, adds borders, and pads to square—but over-pads (e.g., train1 becomes 14x14 instead of 12x12, with shapes centered wrongly in rows 6-9 instead of rows 3-10 top-aligned); for train2, shapes are crammed into rows 12-16 with huge background overhead (28x28 vs expected ~20x20), and order wrong (1's,5's,4's,6's misplaced relative to expected vertical-ish but horizontal arrangement).
 * Train1 generated: Shapes horizontally concatenated but normalized wrongly (8's too blocky/wide, 1's shifted right, 3's bottom-heavy flip failed), dimensions oversized with borders, shapes in middle rows 6-9 with top/bottom all-bg rows; expected: 12x12, shapes top-aligned in rows 3-10, 8's left (4w), then 1's (2w), then 3's (6w max), with precise cutouts (e.g., 8's have 2-wide bottom).
 * Train2 generated: All-bg top 11 rows, shapes in 12-16 (1's left, then 5's/4's/6's distorted/wrong widths), bottom all-bg; expected: More compact ~20x20, shapes in scattered rows (e.g., 4's mid-right rows 3-8, 6's lower rows 11-16, 1's bottom rows 19-26, 5's integrated), horizontal but with vertical spacing preserved? Wait, expected seems to rearrange in appearance order horizontally per "section" but code linearizes wrongly.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken (rotation swaps h/w but positions list incorrectly, flip miscalculates mass leading to upside-down or mirrored shapes); do not use as-is.
 * Overall, component extraction essential and works, but sorting/placement/padding logic misses top-alignment, exact widths, and minimal sizing; unknown why train2 expected has shapes not strictly horizontal (e.g., 1's at bottom, 5's overlapping sections)—may need order by first appearance x-then-y, not just y.
 * Test output generated: A massive ~32x48 grid (way oversized from over-padding/squaring), mostly all 4's (bg), with shapes only in rows 18-20 (8's left long block, then 3's/5's/9's/6's concatenated but distorted: 8's 3-high x10-wide instead of structured, 9's 3-high x9-wide blocky, 6's trailing); this does not look correct—expected should be compact square (maybe 20x20+), shapes normalized and top-aligned horizontally in order of appearance (likely 8,3,5,9,6 from positions), preserving cutouts (e.g., 8's probably L or irregular, not solid; 9's stepped, 6's bar-like), with 1-cell borders and centered padding if needed, not this huge empty expanse; differences: wrong dims/shape integrity/placement, shapes merged/distorted without gaps but wrong orientations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it is an oversized rectangular-then-squared grid (~32 rows x 48 cols, padded to square?) with excessive background, shapes only in a narrow band (rows 18-20), and visible distortions (e.g., 8's as solid 10-wide bar instead of expected irregular form with holes/cutouts, 9's blocky without steps, overall not top-aligned or compact).
 * The test output is missing proper normalization (no rotation/flip to standard, leading to raw concatenated widths totaling ~40+), exact shape preservation (flood fill captures but transforms break structure), and minimal sizing (should be ~22x22 bordered square based on max h~8-10, total w~30-40, pad to square).
 * Make sure to account for multiple asymmetric shapes (e.g., 3's small, 5's/6's medium, 9's large stepped, 8's complex) by improving flip/rotate heuristics and sorting by scan order (row-major left-to-right-top-to-bottom) to handle test case; unknown why generated is so vertically centered with huge top/bottom bg, but likely from code's +2 borders then aggressive squaring without trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting connected components (blobs) of the same non-background color from an input grid, filtering out small ones (less than 4 cells), normalizing their positions to a local origin, optionally rotating them to prefer landscape orientation, sorting them by their original top-left positions, and then reassembling them into a new compact grid with a background border and padding to a square shape. The goal is to create a "catalog" or standardized rendering of the extracted shapes while preserving their identities and relative ordering, but the current approach fails in arrangement, leading to mismatched layouts compared to expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color (or 0 if none); all other colors are treated as foreground for components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and same-color; only extract those with >=4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalize each component by translating positions relative to its min_r and min_c, compute its bounding box height (h) and width (w).
 * Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if h > w (tall shapes) to make them wider, updating positions as (c, h-1-r); this prefers horizontal/landscape shapes but may alter visual orientation subtly.
 * Sort extracted shapes by original (min_r, min_c) to process in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, mimicking reading order.
 * Arrangement is critical: current horizontal side-by-side placement creates a thin strip, but expected outputs suggest a more grid-like or vertically stacked layout that preserves relative vertical positioning (e.g., top shapes above bottom ones, with horizontal alignment within rows).
 * Add a 1-cell border of background around the inner arrangement, then pad the entire grid to the nearest square (max dimension) with background, centering the content.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs have consistent sizing (e.g., 12x12 for training 1, 20x20 for training 2), implying the inner arrangement's max_h and total_w determine the final side length after border (+2) and padding.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may overlap or align in the new grid based on original relative positions, but current code ignores vertical offsets and packs everything into one row; also, rotation may misalign shapes if the puzzle expects no rotation or different rotation logic.
 * Handle empty grids or no valid components by returning a single background cell.
 * Outputs use lists of lists, with rows as lists of ints; ensure deep copies to avoid mutation.
 * Potential edge: Shapes with irregular bounding boxes (e.g., L-shapes) must fill their relative positions correctly without gaps in the new grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common non-zero color; useful for distinguishing foreground.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:

                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This performs standard 4-connected flood fill for same-color components; essential for extracting blobs accurately.)

```python
def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:

    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts and filters components >=4 cells, with min_r/min_c for sorting; core to identifying valid shapes, but note it skips background cells correctly.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    relative = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]
    h = max(r for r, _ in relative) + 1
    w = max(c for _, c in relative) + 1
    return relative, h, w
```
(This normalizes shape positions to (0,0) origin and computes tight bounding box; helpful for isolating shapes.)

```python
def rotate_if_tall(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if h <= w:
        return positions, h, w
    new_positions = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]
    new_h = w
    new_w = h
    return new_positions, new_h, new_w
```
(This rotates tall shapes to landscape; useful but may be a subtlety—puzzle might not require rotation, or it could be causing mismatches in shape orientation.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:

        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This adds a 1-cell background border; correct and necessary for framing.)

            new_grid[offset_r + i][offset_c + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This centers and pads to square with background; works well but amplifies issues if inner grid is imbalanced.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters components (>=4 cells), normalizes positions, and applies optional rotation, but fails in sorting and arrangement: shapes are sorted by (min_r, min_c) but placed horizontally side-by-side in a single row, creating a thin inner grid (e.g., height ~2-4, wide total_w), leading to many empty rows after bordering and square-padding.
 * For training example 1: Generated a 14x14 grid with all shapes crammed into rows 5-8 (8's left, 1's middle, 3's right, but misaligned and no vertical separation), surrounded by 2's border and top/bottom padding; expected is 12x12 with 8's top-left (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1's top-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9), 3's bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 8-13, horizontal), preserving vertical ordering and compactness—generated mismatches by flattening to one row and oversized padding.
 * For training example 2: Generated a 28x28 grid (way oversized) with 10+ empty rows top/bottom, shapes crammed into rows 11-16 (1's left, 5's scattered, 4's/6's middle-right, but jumbled and no grid structure); expected is 20x20 with shapes in a multi-row layout (4's/5's top-middle rows 2-7, 6's middle rows 10-15, 1's bottom rows 18-25, with vertical stacking and horizontal alignment within "rows" of shapes)—generated differs by horizontal packing, wrong size, and poor alignment (e.g., 1's and 5's fragmented).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order but doesn't account for vertical grouping; build_inner_grid is broken for multi-row arrangements—needs to place shapes in rows based on original min_r buckets or similar.
 * Rotation may be unhelpful or incorrect: e.g., in training 1, 3's is horizontal in expected but might be rotated if tall; don't use if it distorts expected shapes.
 * Flood_fill and extract_raw_components are essential and correct for component detection; translate_to_origin is helpful for normalization.
 * add_border and pad_to_square are correct but highlight arrangement flaws (e.g., thin inner -> empty square).
 * Overall, extraction works (shapes identified correctly), but rearrangement doesn't mimic the expected "poster" or "inventory" layout with vertical stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it's a massive ~48x48? grid (inferred from 48 elements per row) mostly filled with background 4's (empty rows 0-16 and 20-47), with shapes crammed into only rows 17-19 (8's left spanning multiple rows but flattened, 3's/5's/9's/6's jumbled horizontally without vertical separation or alignment, e.g., 8's block rows 17-19 cols 1-9, then scattered smaller blobs like 3's at cols 10-12, 5's at 13-21, etc., ending with 6's right).
 * It differs from what we'd expect (based on training): should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with extracted shapes (8,3,5,9,6 colors visible) arranged in a multi-row grid layout (e.g., larger 8's block top, smaller ones below/right, bordered by 4's, centered), preserving relative original positions vertically; instead, horizontal cramming creates imbalance, no stacking (all in 3 rows), and excessive empty space, suggesting the same arrangement bug as training examples.
 * Shapes seem extracted correctly (e.g., large 8's, 9's block, 6's), but placement ignores vertical offsets—e.g., if test has vertically separated shapes, they should stack, not inline; rotation might have flipped some (unknown if needed).
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too sparse/empty, mismatched size, no visual "catalog" structure; likely fails if test expects similar to training 2's stacked layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains a background color and multiple connected components (shapes) of different colors, and the goal is to extract the "main" shapes (likely those with sufficient size, e.g., >=4 cells), normalize their position and orientation in a canonical way (translating to top-left, possibly rotating/flipping for consistency), and then reassemble them into a new output grid with the same background, arranged in a structured layout (e.g., sorted by original position or color, possibly stacked vertically with borders or spacing to match the expected compositions).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Extract only "main" shapes: Connected components of the same color, excluding the background (identified as the most frequent non-zero color), and filter to those with at least 4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalization is crucial but tricky: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; ensure consistent orientation by rotating clockwise if height > width (to prefer landscape), always flipping vertically (to prefer "upright" or top-heavy?), and conditionally flipping horizontally if the shape is "bottom-right heavy" (more cells in bottom-right quadrant than bottom-left, to prefer left-leaning or balanced asymmetry).
 * Arrangement rules: Shapes should be placed in the output in the order they appear when scanned top-to-bottom, left-to-right (based on the minimum row/col of the component), but stacked vertically rather than horizontally; include spacing or gaps (e.g., 1-2 cells of background) between shapes, and add a uniform border (thickness 2) around the entire composition; the inner grid height should accommodate the tallest shape, but the overall layout expands vertically for multiple shapes.
 * Background handling: Correctly identify as the most common non-zero color (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2, 4 in test); fill all non-shape areas with it; do not treat 0 as background if non-zero colors dominate.
 * Sorting and placement subtleties: After extraction, sort components by their original top-left position (min row, then min col); place each normalized shape at increasing y-positions (vertical stacking) with x-offsets to align left or center; ensure bounding boxes don't overlap and gaps prevent merging; in ex1, the 8-shape is placed highest, 1-shape mid-right, 3-shape lowest-right, suggesting vertical progression with horizontal offsets based on original relative positions.
 * Size and padding: Output should match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., ex1: 12 rows x 12 cols inner? but with border; ex2 taller with more vertical space); add border after inner composition; if no shapes, return a single bg cell.
 * Easy-to-miss elements: Shapes may have irregular forms (e.g., L-shapes or protrusions in ex1's 8 and 3); normalization flips/rotations must preserve connectivity and color but can alter visual "up" direction—over-flipping leads to mismatches (e.g., 3-shape in ex1 appears "upside-down" or mirrored in generated); original positions influence order/placement (not just color); small shapes (<4 cells) are ignored, but in ex2, some 1's and 5's seem split or partial.
 * General: Grids are rectangular; use 4-directional connectivity for flood-fill; handle empty/zero grids gracefully.

```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent non-zero color; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python

                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Flood-fill for connected components; essential and works correctly for extracting same-color blobs.)

```python

    components.sort(key=lambda x: (min(rr for rr, _ in x[1]), min(cc for _, cc in x[1])))
    return components
```
(Extracts and sorts main shapes by original top-left position; very helpful, correctly filters small components and orders by scan order.)

def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not positions:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)

    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1
```
(Translation and bounding box utilities; core to normalization, work well but need integration with correct rotation/flip logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters main shapes (>=4 cells), sorts them by original position, and normalizes via translation/rotation/flip, but arranges them horizontally side-by-side with fixed gaps (1 cell), leading to wide, short grids instead of vertical stacking.
 * Train 1 generated a compact 8x18 grid (after border?) with 8-shape left, 1-shape mid, 3-shape right, all at similar heights (rows 2-5), but expected is 12x12 with vertical separation: 8-shape top (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1-shape mid-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9 but lower effective), empty space below 8, then 3-shape bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 4-9 and 8-11); difference: horizontal vs. vertical layout, no vertical spacing, and possible flip mismatch on 3-shape (appears shifted right in generated).
 * Train 2 generated a messy 10x34 horizontal jumble with shapes overlapping or poorly spaced (e.g., 1's and 5's mixed left, 4's and 6's mid-right, extra 5's/6's duplicated?), but expected is ~18x20 with vertical sections: upper 4's/5's stacked, mid 6's horizontal, lower 1's vertical with 5's right; differences: extreme width from horizontal placement, incorrect sorting/placement (e.g., 1's appear low but should be bottom, 5's duplicated or mispositioned), and border adds uneven padding; unknown why some shapes like 5's are split or extra in generated.
 * Normalization flips (always vertical, conditional horizontal) may over-correct, causing shape orientations to mismatch expected (e.g., 3 in ex1 looks "flipped" horizontally in generated vs. expected left-aligned); rotation only if h>w works but doesn't handle all asymmetries.
 * Arrangement uses max height for inner grid but places all at y=0 with x-offsets, ignoring vertical progression; should instead accumulate height with per-shape y-offsets based on order.
 * add_border is helpful and correct (thickness=2, pads uniformly), but applied to wrong inner layout.
 * is_bottom_right_heavy and flip functions are somewhat helpful for asymmetry but may be too aggressive—consider optional or rule-based (e.g., only if > certain imbalance threshold).
 * Overall, extraction/sorting is strong (shapes identified correctly), but layout is the core failure; no unhelpful functions, but the full program() integrates poorly (e.g., current_x accumulation assumes horizontal).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an extremely wide ~13x51 grid (after border) with all shapes (8,3,5,9,6, etc.) crammed horizontally in a single band (mostly rows 2-11), with some vertical extent for taller shapes like 8/9/6 but no true stacking—e.g., 8-shape left tall, then 3/5/9/6 clustered mid-right, all at similar heights with minimal gaps, leading to a linear "strip" composition.
 * It mismatches expected logic from trainings, which use vertical stacking with offsets (e.g., shapes at increasing y-positions, horizontal shifts for alignment); here, everything is side-by-side, causing overlaps or squeezes (e.g., 9-shape protrudes but not separated vertically from 6); border is added correctly, but inner layout is wrong—test likely needs taller grid with shapes like 8 top, 3/5 mid, 9/6 bottom, sorted by original positions, preserving relative x-offsets from input.
 * Does not make sense: Too horizontal and compact, ignores vertical order from extraction sort; possible normalization issues (e.g., 8-shape rotated wrong, appearing stretched); extra bg fills but no spacing between sections.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from a grid, normalizing their orientation and position to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips based on heuristics like bottom-heaviness or right-heaviness), sorting them by original position, and then rearranging them into a new bordered grid with the background color, likely in a packed row-based layout to simulate a "catalog" or standardized display of the shapes while preserving their normalized forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all empty spaces in the output use this.
 * Extract only connected components (4-connected, same color) with at least 4 cells; ignore smaller blobs or single cells.
 * Components must be flood-filled correctly to capture full shapes, even irregular ones like L-shapes or those with protrusions.
 * Normalization is critical: translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; if height > width, rotate 90° clockwise; check for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top) and flip vertically if so (especially after rotation); check for "bottom-right heavy" (in bottom half, more cells on right than left) and flip horizontally if so; re-translate after each transform to keep origin at (0,0).
 * Sorting: Components are sorted by their original minimum row and column (top-left position in source grid), which determines arrangement order.
 * Arrangement: Pack shapes into rows on a new canvas; use a capacity limit (e.g., max_width + max_height of shapes) to decide when to start a new row; add horizontal gaps (e.g., 2 units) between shapes in a row, vertical gaps (e.g., 0) between rows; align shapes left-to-right in rows, top-to-bottom for rows; compute total canvas size based on max row dimensions.
 * Border: Add a uniform border (thickness 2) of background color around the arranged inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations/flips must update bounding box dimensions correctly after each step; "heaviness" checks only apply if height/width >1; arrangement may need to align shapes to a baseline (e.g., bottom-aligned in rows?) or handle varying heights without vertical centering; original positions influence order but not final placement beyond sorting; ensure no overlaps or out-of-bounds writes; the expected outputs show shapes in "canonical" orientations that look standardized (e.g., L-shapes opening rightward or downward), suggesting normalization is key but may need additional rules like preferring certain rotations.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must respect grid bounds and only same-color cells; normalization can chain (e.g., rotate then flip, re-check heaviness); packing may fail if capacity is miscalculated (e.g., too small, causing unnecessary row breaks); shapes like partial rectangles or hooks (e.g., the 3's L-shape) get flipped to a consistent form, but if flips are wrong, they appear mirrored or rotated incorrectly in output; border thickness is fixed at 2, and canvas must be exactly sized to fit with border.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it handles extraction and normalization partially; issues in packing lead to misaligned rows (e.g., shapes starting at wrong x-offsets); test case has multiple rows of shapes (8,5,9,6 with small 3's), suggesting need for multi-row packing without excessive gaps.

(These handle translation, bounding box, and basic transforms; core to normalization and work correctly individually, but chaining in normalize_shape needs fixes for re-translation and re-bounding after each step.)

        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    return color, positions
```
(This attempts full normalization but is buggy: is_bottom_heavy and is_bottom_right_heavy definitions may be incorrect—bottom_heavy counts top vs bottom but doesn't specify "heavy" threshold clearly; bottom_right_heavy only checks bottom half and compares left/right counts strictly (>); vertical flip condition ties to rotation oddly; doesn't handle multiple rotations or full 360° normalization; re-bounding after flips is good but heaviness checks may need to be recursive or more robust for irregular shapes.)

    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg for _ in range(nw)] for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This correctly adds a fixed-thickness border; helpful and accurate.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided, but it successfully extracts components (e.g., identifies 8,1,3 in train1 and various in train2/test), normalizes positions to origin, and adds border correctly.
 * What worked: Background detection, flood-fill extraction (captures full shapes >=4 cells), translation to origin, basic rotation/flip mechanics, sorting by original min_r/min_c, and border addition; the inner grid filling avoids overlaps.
 * What didn't work: Normalization heuristics are incomplete—e.g., in train1, the 3-shape (likely an L or hook) isn't flipped/rotated to match expected (generated places it as a left-aligned partial rectangle in row 6-9 cols 6-9, but expected has it right-shifted in row 6-7 cols 8-9 and full in row 8-9 cols 4-9, suggesting wrong canonical orientation); in train2, multiple shapes (1,5,4,6) are packed incorrectly (generated spreads them across rows with wrong alignments, e.g., 1's left then 5's right, but expected groups 4's large in middle-right, 5's small left, 6's bottom, 1's bottom-left with extensions).
 * Arrangement/packing is the main failure: Uses capacity = max_w + max_h (e.g., ~8 for squares), gap_h=2, but breaks rows too early or left-aligns without matching expected offsets (e.g., train1 generated puts 3's at col 6, expected at col 4-9 with gap; train2 generated has vertical stacking issues, e.g., 4's split across rows wrongly); no vertical alignment within rows (shapes may need bottom-alignment); total canvas sizing pads correctly but positions don't match.
 * Sorting works (order seems 8 then 1 then 3 in train1, matching original positions), but downstream packing ignores subtle spacing (e.g., expected has larger gaps or fixed columns).
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is broken/not helpful: Capacity logic causes poor packing (e.g., fits 8+1 in row1 but 3 alone in row2 left-aligned; train2 overflows rows wrongly); gaps are asymmetric (h=2, v=0); doesn't compute max row width correctly for centering or right-alignment; suggest replacing with fixed-grid or better knapsack-style packing.
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is partially helpful but flawed: Simple half-split count works for symmetric cases but fails for irregulars (e.g., L-shapes may not trigger flip correctly; threshold is >= but may need > or weighted center-of-mass).
 * Function `is_bottom_right_heavy` similar issue: Only bottom-half check is good, but strict > count may miss balanced-but-skewed shapes; applied too late in chain.
 * Overall, extraction/normalization gets ~70% right (shapes identifiable), but transform logic and packing need overhaul for orientations and layout to match expected standardized arrangements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it rearranges shapes (large 8/9/5/6 blocks, small 3's) into a multi-row packed grid with border 4, but the layout is misaligned similar to trainings—e.g., 8's top-left spanning rows 2-10 cols 2-11, small 3's awkwardly next to it in rows 2-4 cols 12-15, then 5's below in rows 11-20 with internal structure (suggesting partial normalization of a complex shape), 9's mid-right rows 20-28, 6's bottom rows 29-38; this seems like linear left-to-right packing with row breaks, but expected likely needs better canonical orientations (e.g., all "bottom-left" aligned L's or hooks) and tighter/spaced rows matching original relative positions or a grid-like catalog (e.g., sorted into 2-3 per row with even spacing); small 3's are repeated/clustered oddly, possibly from extraction error or no deduping; overall, it "makes sense" as an attempt at rearrangement but fails subtlety like train cases (wrong flips cause 5/9/6 to appear stretched vertically/horizontally; packing capacity too loose, leading to tall thin canvas instead of compact); to handle test, need to refine heaviness to prefer "opening right/down" for hooks, increase gap_h to 3-4 for alignment, and ensure post-transform bounding boxes trigger correct row heights.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from an input grid, normalize each shape's position and orientation to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips), and then rearrange them into a new grid layout with rows of shapes, gaps between them, centered alignment per row, and a bordered background. The output preserves the original colors and connected structure but standardizes the composition for consistency across inputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most common non-zero color as background (bg); ignore all bg cells during extraction, but do not extract components of the bg color itself even if connected.
 * Shape extraction: Only extract 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same color with size >=4 cells; smaller blobs or single cells are ignored as noise. Sort extracted components by their top-left position (min row, then min col) before processing.
 * Normalization process: Translate all positions to origin (0,0); compute bounding box (h=height, w=width); rotate 90° CW repeatedly until h <= w (track rotations for later flips); for vertical flip decision, count cells in top vs. bottom half—if rotations even and bottom heavier, or rotations odd and top heavier, flip vertically; after vertical flip (if any), check bottom half's left vs. right mass—if right heavier, flip horizontally. This ensures a "standard" orientation minimizing asymmetry.
 * Layout arrangement: After normalization, sort shapes implicitly by extraction order (which is position-based); place into rows where each row's max width is max(h+w across shapes) + gaps; start new row if adding next shape exceeds row width; add gap=2 between shapes in row; center each row by shifting left-aligned content; stack rows vertically with no vertical gaps; final inner grid size based on max row width and total height; add thickness=2 border of bg around the entire inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations affect flip logic (even/odd parity changes vertical mass interpretation); bounding box updates after each transform; components must be exactly same-color connected (flood-fill stops at color mismatch); output grid must match exact dimensions and positions—no extra bg inside shapes or overlaps; preserve original colors (do not remap); if no valid shapes, output single bg cell; extraction skips visited cells to avoid reprocessing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with all bg or tiny shapes return minimal bg grid; shapes touching border or each other are still separate if different colors; normalization can change effective h/w; horizontal flip only after vertical to avoid over-correction; sorting by min position ensures consistent order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter(cell for row in g for cell in row if cell != 0)
    return counts.most_common(1)[0][0] if counts else 0
```
(Helpful for reliably detecting bg as the dominant non-zero color; assumes no zero-cells as bg.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Essential for extracting exact connected components of a single color; uses BFS for efficiency and 4-connectivity.)

```python
def extract_all_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    components.append((color, comp))
    components.sort(key=lambda x: (min(rr for rr, _ in x[1]), min(cc for _, cc in x[1])))
    return components
```
(Core extraction function; filters small shapes, sorts by top-left for canonical order—very helpful for reproducible processing.)

(These form the normalization pipeline; critical for standardizing shapes—translate, rotate until h<=w, conditional flips based on mass distribution. The vertical flip logic depends on rotation parity, which is a subtle but key detail.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], thickness: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg] * nw for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(Helpful for final bordering; ensures consistent padding around the composed inner grid.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core extraction, normalization, and layout logic works for simple cases with fewer shapes or standard orientations.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated output has incorrect shape ordering/placement (e.g., shape 1 appears in top-middle but expected at bottom; shape 5 misplaced to right of 1 instead of left; shape 4's wide bar is split and lower than expected; shape 6's L-shape is rotated/flipped wrong, appearing as a vertical stack instead of horizontal with extension). Dimensions mismatch (generated 20x16 inner? vs expected 20x20 with more even spacing); rows not centered properly (e.g., expected has centered 4-bar spanning most width, but generated has it offset); vertical stacking has extra empty rows or misaligned heights.
 * Normalization likely over-rotates or misapplies flips in training 2 (e.g., shape 4's horizontal bar becomes vertical in generated; shape 1's partial square not flipped to match expected orientation); extraction sorts correctly but layout row-breaking fails when shapes have varying h/w post-normalization.
 * Layout uses max_row_w = max_h + max_w, but this assumes single-shape rows—fails when multiple small shapes fit but code breaks rows prematurely; gap=2 is applied but centering shift = total_w - row_used_w doesn't account for gaps in used_w calc.
 * extract_all_main_shapes is helpful and correct (properly filters >=4, sorts); flood_fill is solid (no leaks across colors).
 * The full program() integrates everything but has bugs in row packing (current_x += sw + gap overflows incorrectly) and inner_grid filling (abs_x = shift + local_x ignores gaps in placement, causing overlaps or shifts).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though normalize_shape's flip conditions may need tuning for asymmetric shapes like L's or partial bars.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It extracts 5+ shapes (colors 3,5,6,8,9) with bg=4, but arrangement is a tall vertical stack (32x18?) with shapes in columns rather than rows—e.g., multiple horizontal bars (8,9) stacked directly, small protrusions like 3's on right of some bars suggest poor normalization (possibly unflipped or unrotated, as 3's look like detached arms); shape 5's complex form (looks like a plus or cross with extensions) spans unevenly, indicating failed bounding/translate after flips; no visible gaps between shapes in "rows," and centering absent (left-heavy alignment); border thickness=2 is applied but inner content overflows or misaligns (e.g., 5's bottom extensions hit border unevenly).
 * Compared to expected (inferred from pattern/rules): Should have shapes normalized (e.g., all bars horizontal with h<=w, L-shapes standardized to bottom-left heavy), sorted by original top-left, packed into 2-3 rows with gap=2 and centering (wider rows like 8/9 bars spanning full width), total inner ~20-24 high x max_row_w wide, no vertical stacking without row breaks—current output mashes everything vertically, missing the row-based horizontal composition.
 * Test highlights normalization issues for tall/thin shapes (e.g., 5 and 6 seem rotated wrong, as their extensions are vertical instead of balanced); layout bug amplified here with more shapes, causing no row breaks (current_x never exceeds due to small sw post-norm?); extraction seems to catch all >=4 (good), but order wrong (e.g., 8 before 3, but 3's small position should sort earlier).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 02:48:22] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves extracting distinct connected components (shapes) of the same color from an input grid, ignoring small ones (under 4 cells), normalizing each shape's orientation through translations, rotations, and flips to a canonical form (e.g., minimizing height relative to width and balancing cell distribution), sorting them (likely by original top-left position), and rearranging them into a new bordered grid with row-based packing where rows are filled left-to-right without exceeding a width limit based on the tallest shape, but the current implementation's sorting, normalization balancing, and row alignment logic produce incorrect layouts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are connected components of the same non-background color; background is likely the dominant surrounding color (not necessarily the most common non-zero as currently implemented, which can misidentify it if a shape is larger than the background).
 * Ignore components smaller than 4 cells to filter out noise or minor elements.
 * Normalization must produce a unique canonical representation: translate to (0,0) origin, rotate 90° CW repeatedly until height <= width, then optionally flip vertically if the bottom half has more or equal cells than the top, and flip horizontally if the post-flip bottom-right quadrant has more cells than bottom-left; this ensures consistent orientation but can fail if the balancing logic doesn't match the expected "heavier" side correctly (e.g., subtle cell counts in halves/quadrants can lead to wrong flips).
 * Sorting of shapes should be by their original minimum row then minimum column (top-left priority) to preserve input order, but current implementation sorts components this way before normalization, which is good, but downstream placement ignores it.
 * Layout: Use a maximum row width of 2 * global max height for packing; fill rows greedily left-to-right with gaps (e.g., 2 units); for multi-row outputs, align subsequent rows to the right edge of the previous row's content (via prev_end - row_span +1), but this creates incorrect staggering/overlap in examples; add a 2-unit border around the entire inner grid.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must exactly match expected dimensions and positions, including empty background fills; shapes must not overlap or clip; vertical gaps between rows should be 0 or minimal; in examples, shapes like the 3's in train1 appear in specific orientations (e.g., wide horizontal at bottom, narrow vertical at side) suggesting the normalization sometimes needs to prefer certain rotations/flips over others, or perhaps sort by color after position.
 * Background identification: Current counter ignores 0 and picks most common non-zero, but in examples (bg=2 or 3), it works coincidentally but could fail if background is 0 or less common; extraction skips background and 0.
 * Potential misses: Original shapes may have irregular bounding boxes, so post-normalization bounding boxes must be recomputed accurately; flips/rotations change coordinates, requiring re-translation; large grids (like test) need efficient packing without unnecessary empty space.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes, multiple shapes per color (but examples treat same-color connected as one), and ensure the final grid includes full borders even if inner is empty.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it correctly extracts shapes via flood-fill and filters small ones, normalizes orientations (rotation and flips), and adds borders, but fails on layout packing and alignment.
 * Train1: Generated correctly places 8's and 1's in top rows but swaps the 3's—wide horizontal 3's (6-wide) appear in rows 6-7 middle instead of rows 8-9 middle, and narrow vertical 3's (2-wide) in rows 8-9 right instead of rows 6-7 right; this suggests wrong row assignment and possible normalization flip/rotation mismatch for 3's (unknown why, perhaps vertical flip threshold is too loose).
 * Train2: Generated has severely disrupted layout—e.g., 1's and 5's are placed top-middle and scattered, 4's horizontal in middle but shifted left, 6's bottom but with extra rows and misalignments (e.g., 1's span rows 2-5 and 18-25 incorrectly); expected has more compact vertical stacking with 4's/6's centered, 1's/5's side-placed, indicating packing greedily overflows rows and the right-alignment for subsequent rows (prev_end calc) causes staggering/overlap.
 * Sorting by original position works for extraction but is ignored in placement, leading to arbitrary row filling.
 * Normalization balancing (e.g., v_flipped if bottom >= top) produces wrong orientations for asymmetric shapes like the 3's, causing expected vs. generated shape forms to differ (e.g., one vertical, one horizontal).
 * Row packing logic breaks on multi-shape rows: max_row_w = 2*max_h is reasonable but gap=2 and left-to-right greedy fill doesn't center or justify rows correctly; vert_gap=0 is good but current_y += mh + vert_gap skips properly, yet prev_end adjustment for row_start_x misaligns non-first rows to the left instead of right/center.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the full program() integrates them poorly; extract_all_main_shapes and flood_fill are essential and correct, while normalize_shape needs refinement for flip conditions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it produces a large 32x22 grid (after border?) with shapes like 8's (11-wide horizontal top), 3's (3-wide vertical side), 5's (scattered horizontal/vertical middle), 9's (11-wide horizontal bottom), 6's (9-wide horizontal very bottom), but placements show irregularities: e.g., 3's repeat in cols 13-15 across multiple row groups without connection, 5's have a wide 9-cell row 14-16 but narrow above/below suggesting poor packing, and overall staggering (e.g., row starts shift leftward) creates empty spaces and non-compact layout unlike the tighter, vertically stacked expected patterns in trains.
 * Compared to trains, it exacerbates alignment issues: shapes aren't right-justified or centered per row (e.g., 8's and 9's span cols 2-12 but 5's/6's start at col 7, leaving uneven gaps); no expected provided, but mentally simulating rules (extract/normalize/sort by pos/pack rows max 2*max_h~22 wide, border), it should be more uniform without the vertical repetition of side 3's or mid-grid 5's overflow—likely wrong due to same row_start_x bug causing left-drift and normalization failing on complex shapes like 5's/6's (e.g., if they have uneven quadrants, flips misorient).
 * Test highlights scalability issue: with more/larger shapes (colors 3,5,6,8,9), greedy packing creates too many short rows and misaligns, missing subtle rule that rows should be centered or fully left-aligned without prev_end adjustment.

[2025-10-01 02:48:22] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify the background color, extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors that meet a minimum size threshold, normalize each shape's orientation and position through translations, rotations, and flips to standardize their appearance (e.g., making them "bottom-left justified" based on weight distribution), and then rearrange these normalized shapes into a new compact grid arranged horizontally in the order they appear in the original grid (sorted by top-left position), with added borders and padding to form a square output grid while preserving the original colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most frequent non-zero color as background; ignore zeros and treat them as empty/transparent, but ensure extraction skips background entirely.
 * Shape extraction: Only consider 4-connected (up/down/left/right) components of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise should be omitted. Sort extracted shapes by their minimum row (topmost position), then by minimum column (leftmost within same row) to preserve reading order (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom in original grid).
 * Normalization subtleties: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. If height > width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise to prefer landscape orientation, then re-translate. For vertical flip: Divide bounding box height in half; if bottom half has equal or more cells than top half, flip vertically (upside-down) and re-translate—this prefers "upright" or balanced shapes but can invert if bottom-heavy. For horizontal flip: In the bottom half, if more cells are on the right than left, flip horizontally (mirror left-right) and re-translate—this prefers left-heavy bottoms. Recalculate bounding box after each transformation. These flips/rotations can subtly change how shapes "face" or align, and equal-weight cases flip vertical (which might not always be desired if the puzzle expects "as-is" for balanced shapes).
 * Arrangement: Place normalized shapes side-by-side horizontally in a row, with 1-cell gaps between them (but no leading gap for the first). Use the max height across all shapes for the row height; widths add up with gaps. This creates a rectangular inner grid.
 * Border and padding: Add a thin border (size 1 in this attempt, but expected seems to use size 2 or variable) of background color around the inner grid. Then pad the entire bordered grid to a square by centering it in a larger grid of side length equal to max(outer_height, outer_width), filling extras with background—this ensures square output but can lead to oversized grids if inner arrangement is too wide/tall.
 * Grid sizing issues: Outputs must match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected 12x12, but generated 16x16; train2 expected ~20x28? but generated 32x32). Avoid over-padding or assuming fixed sizes; calculate minimally. Preserve exact cell counts and positions from normalized shapes without overlap or clipping.
 * Color preservation: Keep original colors for shapes; do not change them during normalization or placement.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have uneven shapes, multiple components per color, or shapes touching borders. Zeros are not background but empty—do not treat as shapes. If no shapes, output minimal background grid. Sorting ensures order like reading a book, which might place vertically stacked shapes in input as sequential in output.
 * Potential misses: The >=4 cell threshold works but might filter too aggressively if small shapes are intended. Horizontal arrangement assumes all fit in one row; if too wide, might need multi-row or vertical stacking (not handled here). Border size is inconsistent (attempt uses 1, but expected visuals suggest 2). Flips might over-transform (e.g., equal bottom/top flips vertical, but expected might keep original orientation). Padding centers but can create uneven borders if dimensions differ oddly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it correctly identifies background via frequency and extracts components using flood fill with size filter and sorting by position, which isolates main shapes in order.
 * Normalization functions (translate, bounding box, heaviness checks, flips, rotate) are conceptually helpful for standardizing shapes but produce incorrect orientations/flips in outputs (e.g., shapes appear inverted or mirrored compared to expected, possibly due to flipping on equal weights or unnecessary rotations).
 * Horizontal arrangement with gaps works in theory but fails in practice: shapes are placed but with wrong spacing (no gaps in some expected), leading to oversized inner grids; train1 places only partial/wrong shapes (e.g., only 3's visible, missing 8/1), train2 crams multiple shapes into one area without proper separation.
 * Border addition (size 1) and padding to square are implemented but wrong: uses border=1 (expected visuals suggest 2), and padding over-expands (e.g., train1 to 16x16 vs expected 12x12; train2 to 32x32 vs ~20x28; test to ~50x50 vs likely smaller compact square), centering but creating too much empty space.
 * arrange_shapes_horizontal adds +1 gaps between shapes (including after last?), inflating width unnecessarily—expected has tighter packing without consistent gaps.
 * place_shape is basic and correct for overlaying but clips if out-of-bounds (not an issue here).
 * Overall, extraction and normalization are partially working (shapes are detected), but transformation rules are too aggressive/subtle mismatches (e.g., unknown why train1 only shows 3's, perhaps extraction missed colors or sorting failed); arrangement/bordering/padding bloat the grid size and misplace elements.
 * Function add_border is helpful but needs adjustable size (try 2); pad_to_max_dimension is relevant but over-pads—consider minimal square without centering if not needed.
 * Functions like count_cells_in_half, is_bottom_heavy, flip_vertical, count_bottom_left_right, is_bottom_right_heavy, flip_horizontal are tied to normalization and provide weight-based decisions, but may be overkill or incorrect for puzzle (e.g., expected shapes seem unrotated/unflipped in train1/2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an enormously oversized ~50x50 grid (way larger than needed) filled almost entirely with background 4's, with shapes (6,9,8,5) crammed into the bottom rows (rows 20-29) in a dense, non-arranged cluster without horizontal spacing, borders, or proper padding/centering—expected should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with shapes arranged horizontally in sorted order, thin borders, and minimal padding, preserving distinct separated positions like in training examples.
 * Shapes appear partially normalized (e.g., 9's in a block, 6's extended, 8/5 adjacent) but not translated/rotated/flipped correctly, and placement ignores order/sorting, leading to overlap or wrong adjacency; no visible borders, and excessive empty space above suggests failed inner grid calculation or padding explosion.
 * This highlights the same issues as training: over-sized output from bad arrangement + padding, incomplete shape extraction/placement (possibly missed some components or colors), and normalization not matching expected orientations (e.g., if test has tall shapes, rotation might have failed silently).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 possibly empty but backgrounds are non-zero), and the goal is to identify distinct connected shapes (blobs of the same color, excluding the background), normalize their positions and orientations to a standard form, and rearrange them into a new larger grid framed by the background color, with shapes placed in a specific spatial layout (e.g., horizontally adjacent or in rows/columns based on original positions) rather than simply stacked.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other colors represent potential shapes, but only connected components (4-connected, via flood fill) of size >=4 cells are considered "main shapes"—smaller blobs are ignored.
 * Shapes must be extracted per color, taking the largest component per color if multiple exist (as in the code's components_by_color logic).
 * Normalization involves translating the shape to (0,0) top-left, then optionally rotating 90 degrees clockwise if height >= width (to prefer wider orientations?), checking for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top half) and flipping vertically if so, then trimming empty space from top/left to re-minimize bounding box— this seems partially correct but may over-rotate or flip in ways that distort shapes relative to expected outputs.
 * Arrangement is key: the code stacks shapes vertically into a square inner canvas (summing heights, max width, padding to square), then adds a 1-cell border, but expected outputs place shapes horizontally adjacent (e.g., in example 1, 8's left, 1's middle-right, 3's bottom-right; in example 2, shapes like 4's and 6's are split across rows/columns), suggesting sorting by original min row position and placing side-by-side or in a grid layout to fit within a bordered frame matching input dimensions or expanded minimally.
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by min row of positions, which is good for vertical order, but expected seems to preserve horizontal relationships or place in original relative positions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs expand the grid (e.g., example 1 input likely 10x10 becomes 12x12 framed), with empty space filled by background; shapes don't overlap and are not rotated/flipped in ways that change their relative "up" direction—code's bottom-heavy flip may be unnecessary or wrongly applied.
 * Handle empty/whitespace: Grids may have irregular shapes; ensure no overwriting during placement.
 * Colors: Preserve original colors; background frames everything.
 * Edge cases: Multiple components per color (take largest); no shapes (return minimal bg grid); varying input sizes.
 * Puzzle rules imply preserving shape integrity—no scaling, just translation/rotation/flip for canonical form, then precise placement to match a "composed" image where shapes are juxtaposed as if "cut out" and reassembled in a new composition.

    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the most common non-zero as bg, useful for framing and exclusion.)

    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components per color.)

                component = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                size = len(component)
                if size >= 4:
                    if color not in components_by_color or size > len(components_by_color[color][1]):
                        components_by_color[color] = (color, component)
    shapes = list(components_by_color.values())
    shapes.sort(key=lambda x: min(pr for pr, pc in x[1]))
    return shapes
```
(This is helpful for identifying and sorting largest shapes by min row, but may need adjustment to handle multiple per color or different sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2) and extracts main shapes via flood fill, ignoring small components and bg— this worked for finding the right colors and rough positions.
 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors in an input grid, normalize their positions, orientations, and shapes to a standard form (e.g., top-left aligned, possibly rotated or flipped for consistency), and then rearrange them horizontally side-by-side in a new output grid filled with the background color, ensuring the overall output is a square grid with optional bordering padding while preserving the relative internal structure of each shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the dominant color in the grid (most frequent non-zero value), but it may surround shapes or fill large areas; do not treat zero as background unless specified, and ensure shapes are only extracted if they are connected components of the same color with at least a minimum size (e.g., >=4 cells in the code, but this threshold may be arbitrary or unnecessary).
 * Shapes must be extracted via flood fill on connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right), ignoring background and other colors; small or isolated cells (<4) are skipped, which worked but may over-filter if shapes are small.
 * Normalization is crucial: translate shapes to (0,0) origin (min row/col = 0), determine bounding box height/width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise if height > width to make them landscape-oriented, flip horizontally if the bottom half has more mass on the right than left (to standardize "facing" or asymmetry), and re-normalize origin after transformations; this attempts to canonicalize shapes but fails in examples due to incorrect rotation/flipping logic (e.g., over-rotates or flips asymmetrically, leading to distorted placements).
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by minimum row position in original grid (top-to-bottom order of first appearance), which may be correct for reading order but doesn't match expected horizontal left-to-right arrangement in outputs.
 * Placement: Shapes are placed side-by-side horizontally in rows, aligned to the top of the output grid, with their normalized widths added cumulatively; add 1-cell borders top/bottom/left/right around the entire arrangement, then pad to make the output square by adding background rows/columns centered (e.g., if wider than tall, add rows in the middle); total output size should match the minimal square enclosing the bordered arrangement, but code over-pads massively (e.g., +2 borders then squaring leads to oversized grids).
 * Subtleties: Preserve exact relative positions within each shape (no stretching/compression); do not merge shapes or alter colors; output must exactly match expected dimensions and cell values, including background fills; in examples, shapes are abutted directly without gaps between them, but bordered overall; rotations/flips must ensure shapes "face" consistently (e.g., bottom-heavy or asymmetric shapes flipped to standardize); minimum shape size (>=4) skips noise but may miss valid small shapes; background identification counts only non-zero, but if all zero, defaults to 0—ensure it doesn't misidentify shapes as background.
 * Edge cases: Grids with no shapes return single background cell; varying shape sizes require dynamic max height for vertical alignment; if arrangement is taller than wide post-border, pad columns centered; test input has multiple shapes (colors 8,3,5,9,6?) that need sequential horizontal placement without distortion.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid re-processing; use deque for BFS efficiency; counter for background via frequency; handle empty grids; sorting by y-position assumes vertical scanning order, but examples suggest left-to-right or appearance order; final squaring pads symmetrically but code's half = extra//2 may off-center if odd; generated outputs show shapes concatenated horizontally but with wrong normalization (e.g., 8's block is too wide/tall, 1's misplaced), leading to non-matching dimensions (14x14 vs expected 12x12 for train1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This works well for finding the most frequent non-background color as bg, but may need adjustment if bg is zero or sparse.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])

                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of the same color, avoiding background and other shapes; use it in future attempts.)

```python
def get_h_w(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in positions)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```
(This correctly computes bounding box height/width from positions; helpful for normalization and placement sizing.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (The full function from the code is partially helpful for origin translation and basic rotation/flip, but broken in rotation logic—if h > w, it rotates but then swaps h/w incorrectly, and flip condition based on bottom-half mass is heuristic but misapplies, leading to distorted shapes; salvage the translation parts but rewrite rotation/flip.)
```
(Partially helpful for translation to (0,0) and bounding box calc, but the rotation (if h>w, rotate to landscape then flip vertically?) and flip (bottom-right > bottom-left mass) are flawed and cause mismatches; do not reuse as-is, but adapt the min_r/min_c normalization.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 for train1, 3 for train2) and extracts components via flood fill, skipping small ones (>=4 cells), which worked for finding main shapes but may be too strict.
 * Normalization attempts to standardize orientation (rotate if tall, flip if asymmetric) but fails: for train1, the 8-shape is rotated/flipped into a 4x4 block instead of expected 4-high x 4-wide with cutout; 1-shape becomes 2x2 but misplaced; 3-shape distorted to 2-high x 6-wide but wrong alignment.
 * Placement sorts shapes by min row (vertical order), then concatenates horizontally with no gaps, adds borders, and pads to square—but over-pads (e.g., train1 becomes 14x14 instead of 12x12, with shapes centered wrongly in rows 6-9 instead of rows 3-10 top-aligned); for train2, shapes are crammed into rows 12-16 with huge background overhead (28x28 vs expected ~20x20), and order wrong (1's,5's,4's,6's misplaced relative to expected vertical-ish but horizontal arrangement).
 * Train1 generated: Shapes horizontally concatenated but normalized wrongly (8's too blocky/wide, 1's shifted right, 3's bottom-heavy flip failed), dimensions oversized with borders, shapes in middle rows 6-9 with top/bottom all-bg rows; expected: 12x12, shapes top-aligned in rows 3-10, 8's left (4w), then 1's (2w), then 3's (6w max), with precise cutouts (e.g., 8's have 2-wide bottom).
 * Train2 generated: All-bg top 11 rows, shapes in 12-16 (1's left, then 5's/4's/6's distorted/wrong widths), bottom all-bg; expected: More compact ~20x20, shapes in scattered rows (e.g., 4's mid-right rows 3-8, 6's lower rows 11-16, 1's bottom rows 19-26, 5's integrated), horizontal but with vertical spacing preserved? Wait, expected seems to rearrange in appearance order horizontally per "section" but code linearizes wrongly.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken (rotation swaps h/w but positions list incorrectly, flip miscalculates mass leading to upside-down or mirrored shapes); do not use as-is.
 * Overall, component extraction essential and works, but sorting/placement/padding logic misses top-alignment, exact widths, and minimal sizing; unknown why train2 expected has shapes not strictly horizontal (e.g., 1's at bottom, 5's overlapping sections)—may need order by first appearance x-then-y, not just y.
 * Test output generated: A massive ~32x48 grid (way oversized from over-padding/squaring), mostly all 4's (bg), with shapes only in rows 18-20 (8's left long block, then 3's/5's/9's/6's concatenated but distorted: 8's 3-high x10-wide instead of structured, 9's 3-high x9-wide blocky, 6's trailing); this does not look correct—expected should be compact square (maybe 20x20+), shapes normalized and top-aligned horizontally in order of appearance (likely 8,3,5,9,6 from positions), preserving cutouts (e.g., 8's probably L or irregular, not solid; 9's stepped, 6's bar-like), with 1-cell borders and centered padding if needed, not this huge empty expanse; differences: wrong dims/shape integrity/placement, shapes merged/distorted without gaps but wrong orientations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it is an oversized rectangular-then-squared grid (~32 rows x 48 cols, padded to square?) with excessive background, shapes only in a narrow band (rows 18-20), and visible distortions (e.g., 8's as solid 10-wide bar instead of expected irregular form with holes/cutouts, 9's blocky without steps, overall not top-aligned or compact).
 * The test output is missing proper normalization (no rotation/flip to standard, leading to raw concatenated widths totaling ~40+), exact shape preservation (flood fill captures but transforms break structure), and minimal sizing (should be ~22x22 bordered square based on max h~8-10, total w~30-40, pad to square).
 * Make sure to account for multiple asymmetric shapes (e.g., 3's small, 5's/6's medium, 9's large stepped, 8's complex) by improving flip/rotate heuristics and sorting by scan order (row-major left-to-right-top-to-bottom) to handle test case; unknown why generated is so vertically centered with huge top/bottom bg, but likely from code's +2 borders then aggressive squaring without trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting connected components (blobs) of the same non-background color from an input grid, filtering out small ones (less than 4 cells), normalizing their positions to a local origin, optionally rotating them to prefer landscape orientation, sorting them by their original top-left positions, and then reassembling them into a new compact grid with a background border and padding to a square shape. The goal is to create a "catalog" or standardized rendering of the extracted shapes while preserving their identities and relative ordering, but the current approach fails in arrangement, leading to mismatched layouts compared to expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color (or 0 if none); all other colors are treated as foreground for components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and same-color; only extract those with >=4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalize each component by translating positions relative to its min_r and min_c, compute its bounding box height (h) and width (w).
 * Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if h > w (tall shapes) to make them wider, updating positions as (c, h-1-r); this prefers horizontal/landscape shapes but may alter visual orientation subtly.
 * Sort extracted shapes by original (min_r, min_c) to process in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, mimicking reading order.
 * Arrangement is critical: current horizontal side-by-side placement creates a thin strip, but expected outputs suggest a more grid-like or vertically stacked layout that preserves relative vertical positioning (e.g., top shapes above bottom ones, with horizontal alignment within rows).
 * Add a 1-cell border of background around the inner arrangement, then pad the entire grid to the nearest square (max dimension) with background, centering the content.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs have consistent sizing (e.g., 12x12 for training 1, 20x20 for training 2), implying the inner arrangement's max_h and total_w determine the final side length after border (+2) and padding.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may overlap or align in the new grid based on original relative positions, but current code ignores vertical offsets and packs everything into one row; also, rotation may misalign shapes if the puzzle expects no rotation or different rotation logic.
 * Handle empty grids or no valid components by returning a single background cell.
 * Outputs use lists of lists, with rows as lists of ints; ensure deep copies to avoid mutation.
 * Potential edge: Shapes with irregular bounding boxes (e.g., L-shapes) must fill their relative positions correctly without gaps in the new grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common non-zero color; useful for distinguishing foreground.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This performs standard 4-connected flood fill for same-color components; essential for extracting blobs accurately.)

```python
def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts and filters components >=4 cells, with min_r/min_c for sorting; core to identifying valid shapes, but note it skips background cells correctly.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    relative = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]
    h = max(r for r, _ in relative) + 1
    w = max(c for _, c in relative) + 1
    return relative, h, w
```
(This normalizes shape positions to (0,0) origin and computes tight bounding box; helpful for isolating shapes.)

```python
def rotate_if_tall(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if h <= w:
        return positions, h, w
    new_positions = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]
    new_h = w
    new_w = h
    return new_positions, new_h, new_w
```
(This rotates tall shapes to landscape; useful but may be a subtlety—puzzle might not require rotation, or it could be causing mismatches in shape orientation.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    new_h = gh + 2
    new_w = gw + 2
    new_grid = [[bg] * new_w for _ in range(new_h)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This adds a 1-cell background border; correct and necessary for framing.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    side = max(gh, gw)
    if gh == 0 or gw == 0:
        return [[bg]]
    if side == gh == gw:
        return [row[:] for row in grid]  # copy
    new_grid = [[bg] * side for _ in range(side)]
    offset_r = (side - gh) // 2
    offset_c = (side - gw) // 2
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[offset_r + i][offset_c + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This centers and pads to square with background; works well but amplifies issues if inner grid is imbalanced.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters components (>=4 cells), normalizes positions, and applies optional rotation, but fails in sorting and arrangement: shapes are sorted by (min_r, min_c) but placed horizontally side-by-side in a single row, creating a thin inner grid (e.g., height ~2-4, wide total_w), leading to many empty rows after bordering and square-padding.
 * For training example 1: Generated a 14x14 grid with all shapes crammed into rows 5-8 (8's left, 1's middle, 3's right, but misaligned and no vertical separation), surrounded by 2's border and top/bottom padding; expected is 12x12 with 8's top-left (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1's top-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9), 3's bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 8-13, horizontal), preserving vertical ordering and compactness—generated mismatches by flattening to one row and oversized padding.
 * For training example 2: Generated a 28x28 grid (way oversized) with 10+ empty rows top/bottom, shapes crammed into rows 11-16 (1's left, 5's scattered, 4's/6's middle-right, but jumbled and no grid structure); expected is 20x20 with shapes in a multi-row layout (4's/5's top-middle rows 2-7, 6's middle rows 10-15, 1's bottom rows 18-25, with vertical stacking and horizontal alignment within "rows" of shapes)—generated differs by horizontal packing, wrong size, and poor alignment (e.g., 1's and 5's fragmented).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order but doesn't account for vertical grouping; build_inner_grid is broken for multi-row arrangements—needs to place shapes in rows based on original min_r buckets or similar.
 * Rotation may be unhelpful or incorrect: e.g., in training 1, 3's is horizontal in expected but might be rotated if tall; don't use if it distorts expected shapes.
 * Flood_fill and extract_raw_components are essential and correct for component detection; translate_to_origin is helpful for normalization.
 * add_border and pad_to_square are correct but highlight arrangement flaws (e.g., thin inner -> empty square).
 * Overall, extraction works (shapes identified correctly), but rearrangement doesn't mimic the expected "poster" or "inventory" layout with vertical stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it's a massive ~48x48? grid (inferred from 48 elements per row) mostly filled with background 4's (empty rows 0-16 and 20-47), with shapes crammed into only rows 17-19 (8's left spanning multiple rows but flattened, 3's/5's/9's/6's jumbled horizontally without vertical separation or alignment, e.g., 8's block rows 17-19 cols 1-9, then scattered smaller blobs like 3's at cols 10-12, 5's at 13-21, etc., ending with 6's right).
 * It differs from what we'd expect (based on training): should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with extracted shapes (8,3,5,9,6 colors visible) arranged in a multi-row grid layout (e.g., larger 8's block top, smaller ones below/right, bordered by 4's, centered), preserving relative original positions vertically; instead, horizontal cramming creates imbalance, no stacking (all in 3 rows), and excessive empty space, suggesting the same arrangement bug as training examples.
 * Shapes seem extracted correctly (e.g., large 8's, 9's block, 6's), but placement ignores vertical offsets—e.g., if test has vertically separated shapes, they should stack, not inline; rotation might have flipped some (unknown if needed).
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too sparse/empty, mismatched size, no visual "catalog" structure; likely fails if test expects similar to training 2's stacked layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains a background color and multiple connected components (shapes) of different colors, and the goal is to extract the "main" shapes (likely those with sufficient size, e.g., >=4 cells), normalize their position and orientation in a canonical way (translating to top-left, possibly rotating/flipping for consistency), and then reassemble them into a new output grid with the same background, arranged in a structured layout (e.g., sorted by original position or color, possibly stacked vertically with borders or spacing to match the expected compositions).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Extract only "main" shapes: Connected components of the same color, excluding the background (identified as the most frequent non-zero color), and filter to those with at least 4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalization is crucial but tricky: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; ensure consistent orientation by rotating clockwise if height > width (to prefer landscape), always flipping vertically (to prefer "upright" or top-heavy?), and conditionally flipping horizontally if the shape is "bottom-right heavy" (more cells in bottom-right quadrant than bottom-left, to prefer left-leaning or balanced asymmetry).
 * Arrangement rules: Shapes should be placed in the output in the order they appear when scanned top-to-bottom, left-to-right (based on the minimum row/col of the component), but stacked vertically rather than horizontally; include spacing or gaps (e.g., 1-2 cells of background) between shapes, and add a uniform border (thickness 2) around the entire composition; the inner grid height should accommodate the tallest shape, but the overall layout expands vertically for multiple shapes.
 * Background handling: Correctly identify as the most common non-zero color (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2, 4 in test); fill all non-shape areas with it; do not treat 0 as background if non-zero colors dominate.
 * Sorting and placement subtleties: After extraction, sort components by their original top-left position (min row, then min col); place each normalized shape at increasing y-positions (vertical stacking) with x-offsets to align left or center; ensure bounding boxes don't overlap and gaps prevent merging; in ex1, the 8-shape is placed highest, 1-shape mid-right, 3-shape lowest-right, suggesting vertical progression with horizontal offsets based on original relative positions.
 * Size and padding: Output should match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., ex1: 12 rows x 12 cols inner? but with border; ex2 taller with more vertical space); add border after inner composition; if no shapes, return a single bg cell.
 * Easy-to-miss elements: Shapes may have irregular forms (e.g., L-shapes or protrusions in ex1's 8 and 3); normalization flips/rotations must preserve connectivity and color but can alter visual "up" direction—over-flipping leads to mismatches (e.g., 3-shape in ex1 appears "upside-down" or mirrored in generated); original positions influence order/placement (not just color); small shapes (<4 cells) are ignored, but in ex2, some 1's and 5's seem split or partial.
 * General: Grids are rectangular; use 4-directional connectivity for flood-fill; handle empty/zero grids gracefully.

```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent non-zero color; useful and accurate across examples.)

                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Flood-fill for connected components; essential and works correctly for extracting same-color blobs.)

```python
def extract_all_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:

                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    components.append((color, comp))
    components.sort(key=lambda x: (min(rr for rr, _ in x[1]), min(cc for _, cc in x[1])))
    return components
```
(Extracts and sorts main shapes by original top-left position; very helpful, correctly filters small components and orders by scan order.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not positions:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]

def get_bounding_box(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1
```
(Translation and bounding box utilities; core to normalization, work well but need integration with correct rotation/flip logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters main shapes (>=4 cells), sorts them by original position, and normalizes via translation/rotation/flip, but arranges them horizontally side-by-side with fixed gaps (1 cell), leading to wide, short grids instead of vertical stacking.
 * Train 1 generated a compact 8x18 grid (after border?) with 8-shape left, 1-shape mid, 3-shape right, all at similar heights (rows 2-5), but expected is 12x12 with vertical separation: 8-shape top (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1-shape mid-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9 but lower effective), empty space below 8, then 3-shape bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 4-9 and 8-11); difference: horizontal vs. vertical layout, no vertical spacing, and possible flip mismatch on 3-shape (appears shifted right in generated).
 * Train 2 generated a messy 10x34 horizontal jumble with shapes overlapping or poorly spaced (e.g., 1's and 5's mixed left, 4's and 6's mid-right, extra 5's/6's duplicated?), but expected is ~18x20 with vertical sections: upper 4's/5's stacked, mid 6's horizontal, lower 1's vertical with 5's right; differences: extreme width from horizontal placement, incorrect sorting/placement (e.g., 1's appear low but should be bottom, 5's duplicated or mispositioned), and border adds uneven padding; unknown why some shapes like 5's are split or extra in generated.
 * Normalization flips (always vertical, conditional horizontal) may over-correct, causing shape orientations to mismatch expected (e.g., 3 in ex1 looks "flipped" horizontally in generated vs. expected left-aligned); rotation only if h>w works but doesn't handle all asymmetries.
 * Arrangement uses max height for inner grid but places all at y=0 with x-offsets, ignoring vertical progression; should instead accumulate height with per-shape y-offsets based on order.
 * add_border is helpful and correct (thickness=2, pads uniformly), but applied to wrong inner layout.
 * is_bottom_right_heavy and flip functions are somewhat helpful for asymmetry but may be too aggressive—consider optional or rule-based (e.g., only if > certain imbalance threshold).
 * Overall, extraction/sorting is strong (shapes identified correctly), but layout is the core failure; no unhelpful functions, but the full program() integrates poorly (e.g., current_x accumulation assumes horizontal).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an extremely wide ~13x51 grid (after border) with all shapes (8,3,5,9,6, etc.) crammed horizontally in a single band (mostly rows 2-11), with some vertical extent for taller shapes like 8/9/6 but no true stacking—e.g., 8-shape left tall, then 3/5/9/6 clustered mid-right, all at similar heights with minimal gaps, leading to a linear "strip" composition.
 * It mismatches expected logic from trainings, which use vertical stacking with offsets (e.g., shapes at increasing y-positions, horizontal shifts for alignment); here, everything is side-by-side, causing overlaps or squeezes (e.g., 9-shape protrudes but not separated vertically from 6); border is added correctly, but inner layout is wrong—test likely needs taller grid with shapes like 8 top, 3/5 mid, 9/6 bottom, sorted by original positions, preserving relative x-offsets from input.
 * Does not make sense: Too horizontal and compact, ignores vertical order from extraction sort; possible normalization issues (e.g., 8-shape rotated wrong, appearing stretched); extra bg fills but no spacing between sections.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from a grid, normalizing their orientation and position to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips based on heuristics like bottom-heaviness or right-heaviness), sorting them by original position, and then rearranging them into a new bordered grid with the background color, likely in a packed row-based layout to simulate a "catalog" or standardized display of the shapes while preserving their normalized forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all empty spaces in the output use this.
 * Extract only connected components (4-connected, same color) with at least 4 cells; ignore smaller blobs or single cells.
 * Components must be flood-filled correctly to capture full shapes, even irregular ones like L-shapes or those with protrusions.
 * Normalization is critical: translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; if height > width, rotate 90° clockwise; check for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top) and flip vertically if so (especially after rotation); check for "bottom-right heavy" (in bottom half, more cells on right than left) and flip horizontally if so; re-translate after each transform to keep origin at (0,0).
 * Sorting: Components are sorted by their original minimum row and column (top-left position in source grid), which determines arrangement order.
 * Arrangement: Pack shapes into rows on a new canvas; use a capacity limit (e.g., max_width + max_height of shapes) to decide when to start a new row; add horizontal gaps (e.g., 2 units) between shapes in a row, vertical gaps (e.g., 0) between rows; align shapes left-to-right in rows, top-to-bottom for rows; compute total canvas size based on max row dimensions.
 * Border: Add a uniform border (thickness 2) of background color around the arranged inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations/flips must update bounding box dimensions correctly after each step; "heaviness" checks only apply if height/width >1; arrangement may need to align shapes to a baseline (e.g., bottom-aligned in rows?) or handle varying heights without vertical centering; original positions influence order but not final placement beyond sorting; ensure no overlaps or out-of-bounds writes; the expected outputs show shapes in "canonical" orientations that look standardized (e.g., L-shapes opening rightward or downward), suggesting normalization is key but may need additional rules like preferring certain rotations.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must respect grid bounds and only same-color cells; normalization can chain (e.g., rotate then flip, re-check heaviness); packing may fail if capacity is miscalculated (e.g., too small, causing unnecessary row breaks); shapes like partial rectangles or hooks (e.g., the 3's L-shape) get flipped to a consistent form, but if flips are wrong, they appear mirrored or rotated incorrectly in output; border thickness is fixed at 2, and canvas must be exactly sized to fit with border.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it handles extraction and normalization partially; issues in packing lead to misaligned rows (e.g., shapes starting at wrong x-offsets); test case has multiple rows of shapes (8,5,9,6 with small 3's), suggesting need for multi-row packing without excessive gaps.

    return component
```
(This performs standard 4-connected flood-fill for same-color components; essential and works well for extracting shapes.)

```python
def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts components >=4 cells, ignoring bg and small blobs; very helpful, sorts later by min_r/min_c; accurate for identifying objects.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not positions:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]

def get_bounding_box(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1

def rotate_90_cw(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]

def flip_vertical(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(h - 1 - r, c) for r, c in positions]

def flip_horizontal(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(r, w - 1 - c) for r, c in positions]
```
(These handle translation, bounding box, and basic transforms; core to normalization and work correctly individually, but chaining in normalize_shape needs fixes for re-translation and re-bounding after each step.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    rotated = False
    if h > w:
        positions = rotate_90_cw(positions, h, w)
        rotated = True
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    do_v_flip = rotated or is_bottom_heavy(positions, h)
    if do_v_flip:
        positions = flip_vertical(positions, h)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    if is_bottom_right_heavy(positions, h, w):
        positions = flip_horizontal(positions, w)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    return color, positions
```
(This attempts full normalization but is buggy: is_bottom_heavy and is_bottom_right_heavy definitions may be incorrect—bottom_heavy counts top vs bottom but doesn't specify "heavy" threshold clearly; bottom_right_heavy only checks bottom half and compares left/right counts strictly (>); vertical flip condition ties to rotation oddly; doesn't handle multiple rotations or full 360° normalization; re-bounding after flips is good but heaviness checks may need to be recursive or more robust for irregular shapes.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], thickness: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg for _ in range(nw)] for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This correctly adds a fixed-thickness border; helpful and accurate.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided, but it successfully extracts components (e.g., identifies 8,1,3 in train1 and various in train2/test), normalizes positions to origin, and adds border correctly.
 * What worked: Background detection, flood-fill extraction (captures full shapes >=4 cells), translation to origin, basic rotation/flip mechanics, sorting by original min_r/min_c, and border addition; the inner grid filling avoids overlaps.
 * What didn't work: Normalization heuristics are incomplete—e.g., in train1, the 3-shape (likely an L or hook) isn't flipped/rotated to match expected (generated places it as a left-aligned partial rectangle in row 6-9 cols 6-9, but expected has it right-shifted in row 6-7 cols 8-9 and full in row 8-9 cols 4-9, suggesting wrong canonical orientation); in train2, multiple shapes (1,5,4,6) are packed incorrectly (generated spreads them across rows with wrong alignments, e.g., 1's left then 5's right, but expected groups 4's large in middle-right, 5's small left, 6's bottom, 1's bottom-left with extensions).
 * Arrangement/packing is the main failure: Uses capacity = max_w + max_h (e.g., ~8 for squares), gap_h=2, but breaks rows too early or left-aligns without matching expected offsets (e.g., train1 generated puts 3's at col 6, expected at col 4-9 with gap; train2 generated has vertical stacking issues, e.g., 4's split across rows wrongly); no vertical alignment within rows (shapes may need bottom-alignment); total canvas sizing pads correctly but positions don't match.
 * Sorting works (order seems 8 then 1 then 3 in train1, matching original positions), but downstream packing ignores subtle spacing (e.g., expected has larger gaps or fixed columns).
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is broken/not helpful: Capacity logic causes poor packing (e.g., fits 8+1 in row1 but 3 alone in row2 left-aligned; train2 overflows rows wrongly); gaps are asymmetric (h=2, v=0); doesn't compute max row width correctly for centering or right-alignment; suggest replacing with fixed-grid or better knapsack-style packing.
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is partially helpful but flawed: Simple half-split count works for symmetric cases but fails for irregulars (e.g., L-shapes may not trigger flip correctly; threshold is >= but may need > or weighted center-of-mass).
 * Function `is_bottom_right_heavy` similar issue: Only bottom-half check is good, but strict > count may miss balanced-but-skewed shapes; applied too late in chain.
 * Overall, extraction/normalization gets ~70% right (shapes identifiable), but transform logic and packing need overhaul for orientations and layout to match expected standardized arrangements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it rearranges shapes (large 8/9/5/6 blocks, small 3's) into a multi-row packed grid with border 4, but the layout is misaligned similar to trainings—e.g., 8's top-left spanning rows 2-10 cols 2-11, small 3's awkwardly next to it in rows 2-4 cols 12-15, then 5's below in rows 11-20 with internal structure (suggesting partial normalization of a complex shape), 9's mid-right rows 20-28, 6's bottom rows 29-38; this seems like linear left-to-right packing with row breaks, but expected likely needs better canonical orientations (e.g., all "bottom-left" aligned L's or hooks) and tighter/spaced rows matching original relative positions or a grid-like catalog (e.g., sorted into 2-3 per row with even spacing); small 3's are repeated/clustered oddly, possibly from extraction error or no deduping; overall, it "makes sense" as an attempt at rearrangement but fails subtlety like train cases (wrong flips cause 5/9/6 to appear stretched vertically/horizontally; packing capacity too loose, leading to tall thin canvas instead of compact); to handle test, need to refine heaviness to prefer "opening right/down" for hooks, increase gap_h to 3-4 for alignment, and ensure post-transform bounding boxes trigger correct row heights.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves extracting distinct connected components (shapes) of the same color from an input grid, ignoring small ones (under 4 cells), normalizing each shape's orientation through translations, rotations, and flips to a canonical form (e.g., minimizing height relative to width and balancing cell distribution), sorting them (likely by original top-left position), and rearranging them into a new bordered grid with row-based packing where rows are filled left-to-right without exceeding a width limit based on the tallest shape, but the current implementation's sorting, normalization balancing, and row alignment logic produce incorrect layouts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are connected components of the same non-background color; background is likely the dominant surrounding color (not necessarily the most common non-zero as currently implemented, which can misidentify it if a shape is larger than the background).
 * Ignore components smaller than 4 cells to filter out noise or minor elements.
 * Normalization must produce a unique canonical representation: translate to (0,0) origin, rotate 90° CW repeatedly until height <= width, then optionally flip vertically if the bottom half has more or equal cells than the top, and flip horizontally if the post-flip bottom-right quadrant has more cells than bottom-left; this ensures consistent orientation but can fail if the balancing logic doesn't match the expected "heavier" side correctly (e.g., subtle cell counts in halves/quadrants can lead to wrong flips).
 * Sorting of shapes should be by their original minimum row then minimum column (top-left priority) to preserve input order, but current implementation sorts components this way before normalization, which is good, but downstream placement ignores it.
 * Layout: Use a maximum row width of 2 * global max height for packing; fill rows greedily left-to-right with gaps (e.g., 2 units); for multi-row outputs, align subsequent rows to the right edge of the previous row's content (via prev_end - row_span +1), but this creates incorrect staggering/overlap in examples; add a 2-unit border around the entire inner grid.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must exactly match expected dimensions and positions, including empty background fills; shapes must not overlap or clip; vertical gaps between rows should be 0 or minimal; in examples, shapes like the 3's in train1 appear in specific orientations (e.g., wide horizontal at bottom, narrow vertical at side) suggesting the normalization sometimes needs to prefer certain rotations/flips over others, or perhaps sort by color after position.
 * Background identification: Current counter ignores 0 and picks most common non-zero, but in examples (bg=2 or 3), it works coincidentally but could fail if background is 0 or less common; extraction skips background and 0.
 * Potential misses: Original shapes may have irregular bounding boxes, so post-normalization bounding boxes must be recomputed accurately; flips/rotations change coordinates, requiring re-translation; large grids (like test) need efficient packing without unnecessary empty space.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes, multiple shapes per color (but examples treat same-color connected as one), and ensure the final grid includes full borders even if inner is empty.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it correctly extracts shapes via flood-fill and filters small ones, normalizes orientations (rotation and flips), and adds borders, but fails on layout packing and alignment.
 * Train1: Generated correctly places 8's and 1's in top rows but swaps the 3's—wide horizontal 3's (6-wide) appear in rows 6-7 middle instead of rows 8-9 middle, and narrow vertical 3's (2-wide) in rows 8-9 right instead of rows 6-7 right; this suggests wrong row assignment and possible normalization flip/rotation mismatch for 3's (unknown why, perhaps vertical flip threshold is too loose).
 * Train2: Generated has severely disrupted layout—e.g., 1's and 5's are placed top-middle and scattered, 4's horizontal in middle but shifted left, 6's bottom but with extra rows and misalignments (e.g., 1's span rows 2-5 and 18-25 incorrectly); expected has more compact vertical stacking with 4's/6's centered, 1's/5's side-placed, indicating packing greedily overflows rows and the right-alignment for subsequent rows (prev_end calc) causes staggering/overlap.
 * Sorting by original position works for extraction but is ignored in placement, leading to arbitrary row filling.
 * Normalization balancing (e.g., v_flipped if bottom >= top) produces wrong orientations for asymmetric shapes like the 3's, causing expected vs. generated shape forms to differ (e.g., one vertical, one horizontal).
 * Row packing logic breaks on multi-shape rows: max_row_w = 2*max_h is reasonable but gap=2 and left-to-right greedy fill doesn't center or justify rows correctly; vert_gap=0 is good but current_y += mh + vert_gap skips properly, yet prev_end adjustment for row_start_x misaligns non-first rows to the left instead of right/center.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the full program() integrates them poorly; extract_all_main_shapes and flood_fill are essential and correct, while normalize_shape needs refinement for flip conditions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it produces a large 32x22 grid (after border?) with shapes like 8's (11-wide horizontal top), 3's (3-wide vertical side), 5's (scattered horizontal/vertical middle), 9's (11-wide horizontal bottom), 6's (9-wide horizontal very bottom), but placements show irregularities: e.g., 3's repeat in cols 13-15 across multiple row groups without connection, 5's have a wide 9-cell row 14-16 but narrow above/below suggesting poor packing, and overall staggering (e.g., row starts shift leftward) creates empty spaces and non-compact layout unlike the tighter, vertically stacked expected patterns in trains.
 * Compared to trains, it exacerbates alignment issues: shapes aren't right-justified or centered per row (e.g., 8's and 9's span cols 2-12 but 5's/6's start at col 7, leaving uneven gaps); no expected provided, but mentally simulating rules (extract/normalize/sort by pos/pack rows max 2*max_h~22 wide, border), it should be more uniform without the vertical repetition of side 3's or mid-grid 5's overflow—likely wrong due to same row_start_x bug causing left-drift and normalization failing on complex shapes like 5's/6's (e.g., if they have uneven quadrants, flips misorient).
 * Test highlights scalability issue: with more/larger shapes (colors 3,5,6,8,9), greedy packing creates too many short rows and misaligns, missing subtle rule that rows should be centered or fully left-aligned without prev_end adjustment.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from an input grid, normalize each shape's position and orientation to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips), and then rearrange them into a new grid layout with rows of shapes, gaps between them, centered alignment per row, and a bordered background. The output preserves the original colors and connected structure but standardizes the composition for consistency across inputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most common non-zero color as background (bg); ignore all bg cells during extraction, but do not extract components of the bg color itself even if connected.
 * Shape extraction: Only extract 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same color with size >=4 cells; smaller blobs or single cells are ignored as noise. Sort extracted components by their top-left position (min row, then min col) before processing.
 * Normalization process: Translate all positions to origin (0,0); compute bounding box (h=height, w=width); rotate 90° CW repeatedly until h <= w (track rotations for later flips); for vertical flip decision, count cells in top vs. bottom half—if rotations even and bottom heavier, or rotations odd and top heavier, flip vertically; after vertical flip (if any), check bottom half's left vs. right mass—if right heavier, flip horizontally. This ensures a "standard" orientation minimizing asymmetry.
 * Layout arrangement: After normalization, sort shapes implicitly by extraction order (which is position-based); place into rows where each row's max width is max(h+w across shapes) + gaps; start new row if adding next shape exceeds row width; add gap=2 between shapes in row; center each row by shifting left-aligned content; stack rows vertically with no vertical gaps; final inner grid size based on max row width and total height; add thickness=2 border of bg around the entire inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations affect flip logic (even/odd parity changes vertical mass interpretation); bounding box updates after each transform; components must be exactly same-color connected (flood-fill stops at color mismatch); output grid must match exact dimensions and positions—no extra bg inside shapes or overlaps; preserve original colors (do not remap); if no valid shapes, output single bg cell; extraction skips visited cells to avoid reprocessing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with all bg or tiny shapes return minimal bg grid; shapes touching border or each other are still separate if different colors; normalization can change effective h/w; horizontal flip only after vertical to avoid over-correction; sorting by min position ensures consistent order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

(These form the normalization pipeline; critical for standardizing shapes—translate, rotate until h<=w, conditional flips based on mass distribution. The vertical flip logic depends on rotation parity, which is a subtle but key detail.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], thickness: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg] * nw for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(Helpful for final bordering; ensures consistent padding around the composed inner grid.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core extraction, normalization, and layout logic works for simple cases with fewer shapes or standard orientations.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated output has incorrect shape ordering/placement (e.g., shape 1 appears in top-middle but expected at bottom; shape 5 misplaced to right of 1 instead of left; shape 4's wide bar is split and lower than expected; shape 6's L-shape is rotated/flipped wrong, appearing as a vertical stack instead of horizontal with extension). Dimensions mismatch (generated 20x16 inner? vs expected 20x20 with more even spacing); rows not centered properly (e.g., expected has centered 4-bar spanning most width, but generated has it offset); vertical stacking has extra empty rows or misaligned heights.
 * Normalization likely over-rotates or misapplies flips in training 2 (e.g., shape 4's horizontal bar becomes vertical in generated; shape 1's partial square not flipped to match expected orientation); extraction sorts correctly but layout row-breaking fails when shapes have varying h/w post-normalization.
 * Layout uses max_row_w = max_h + max_w, but this assumes single-shape rows—fails when multiple small shapes fit but code breaks rows prematurely; gap=2 is applied but centering shift = total_w - row_used_w doesn't account for gaps in used_w calc.
 * extract_all_main_shapes is helpful and correct (properly filters >=4, sorts); flood_fill is solid (no leaks across colors).
 * The full program() integrates everything but has bugs in row packing (current_x += sw + gap overflows incorrectly) and inner_grid filling (abs_x = shift + local_x ignores gaps in placement, causing overlaps or shifts).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though normalize_shape's flip conditions may need tuning for asymmetric shapes like L's or partial bars.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It extracts 5+ shapes (colors 3,5,6,8,9) with bg=4, but arrangement is a tall vertical stack (32x18?) with shapes in columns rather than rows—e.g., multiple horizontal bars (8,9) stacked directly, small protrusions like 3's on right of some bars suggest poor normalization (possibly unflipped or unrotated, as 3's look like detached arms); shape 5's complex form (looks like a plus or cross with extensions) spans unevenly, indicating failed bounding/translate after flips; no visible gaps between shapes in "rows," and centering absent (left-heavy alignment); border thickness=2 is applied but inner content overflows or misaligns (e.g., 5's bottom extensions hit border unevenly).
 * Compared to expected (inferred from pattern/rules): Should have shapes normalized (e.g., all bars horizontal with h<=w, L-shapes standardized to bottom-left heavy), sorted by original top-left, packed into 2-3 rows with gap=2 and centering (wider rows like 8/9 bars spanning full width), total inner ~20-24 high x max_row_w wide, no vertical stacking without row breaks—current output mashes everything vertically, missing the row-based horizontal composition.
 * Test highlights normalization issues for tall/thin shapes (e.g., 5 and 6 seem rotated wrong, as their extensions are vertical instead of balanced); layout bug amplified here with more shapes, causing no row breaks (current_x never exceeds due to small sw post-norm?); extraction seems to catch all >=4 (good), but order wrong (e.g., 8 before 3, but 3's small position should sort earlier).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key

[2025-10-01 02:56:27] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of distinct colored shapes (connected components of non-background cells) from an input grid, normalization of those shapes for canonical orientation and position, and rearrangement into a new output grid that packs the shapes into centered rows with gaps, surrounded by a thick background border. The output preserves the original colors of the shapes while using the input's dominant color as the background, aiming to create a standardized "catalog" or layout of the shapes sorted by their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other cells are treated as shape pixels unless they match this background.
 * Only extract "main" shapes: connected components (4-directional flood fill) of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise are ignored.
 * Shapes must be normalized: translate to (0,0) origin, optionally rotate 90 degrees clockwise once if height != width (to attempt squaring), flip vertically based on top/bottom pixel counts for "upright" orientation, and flip horizontally if the bottom-right quadrant has more pixels than bottom-left (for left-leaning bias).
 * Sorting: Components are sorted by the minimum row of their pixels, then by minimum column, to process in top-to-left order.
 * Packing: Shapes are placed into rows where the total width (including gaps of 2 between shapes) fits a capacity of 2 * max_shape_height; rows are centered horizontally in the final inner grid by calculating used width per row and offsetting from the global max width.
 * Output structure: Inner grid built from packed shapes (no overlaps, background-filled), then wrapped in a thickness=2 border of background color; if no shapes, output a single background cell (or bordered version).
 * Subtleties: Normalization can alter shape appearance (e.g., rotation only once may not always canonicalize rectangles properly; vertical flip logic depends on even/odd rotations and half-point splits, which may misorient asymmetric shapes). Gaps are fixed at 2, but only between shapes in a row (no leading/trailing gaps). Row heights are determined by the tallest shape in the row, with shapes aligned at top-left within their bounding box. Empty rows or single-shape rows must still be centered. Colors are preserved, but if normalization changes positions, it can shift pixel placements. Potential edge cases: all-background input, single-pixel shapes (ignored), non-square shapes that don't normalize well, or shapes touching the border. The output dimensions grow based on content (inner height = sum of row max heights; inner width = max row used width; final = inner + 4 thickness).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter, deque
from typing import List, Tuple

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return counts.most_common(1)[0][0] if counts else 0
```
(Helpful for reliably detecting background as the dominant non-zero color.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    component = []
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component.append((sr, sc))
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr = r + dr
            nc = c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Essential for extracting connected components of the same color via BFS.)

```python
def extract_all_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    components.append((color, comp))
    components.sort(key=lambda x: (min(rr for rr, _ in x[1]), min(cc for _, cc in x[1])))
    return components
```
(Helpful for finding and sorting all valid shapes by top-left position.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not pos:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in pos)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in pos)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in pos]

def get_bounding_box(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not pos:
        return 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in pos]
    cs = [c for _, c in pos]
    return max(rs) - min(rs) + 1, max(cs) - min(cs) + 1

def rotate_90_cw(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in pos]

def flip_vertical(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(h - 1 - r, c) for r, c in pos]

def flip_horizontal(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(r, w - 1 - c) for r, c in pos]
```
(These are core for normalization: translation, bounding, and transformations; useful but the full normalize_shape logic needs tuning for accuracy.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled Training example 1, extracting, normalizing, packing, and bordering shapes to match the expected output.
 * For Training example 2, the generated output is INCORRECT: shapes are extracted and normalized but placed in wrong positions and orientations—e.g., color 1 (likely a square or L-shape) appears in rows 2-8 but shifted left and split incorrectly across rows with color 5 and 4 misplaced nearby; color 4 is fragmented and not in the expected long horizontal bar in rows 5-6; color 6 is correctly at bottom but color 5 is in wrong spot; overall layout has extra empty rows and no proper centering, leading to a taller/misaligned grid compared to expected (which has compact rows with 4 at top-right, 5 left-middle, 1 bottom-left, 6 bottom).
 * Sorting by min row/col works for order but fails if shapes overlap in original positions or if normalization rotates them unexpectedly.
 * Normalization is partially helpful but broken/subtle issues: single 90-degree rotation if h!=w forces non-square shapes incorrectly (e.g., long bars become vertical when horizontal expected); vertical flip logic based on half-counts misorients shapes where pixel distribution is even or asymmetric (e.g., may flip an "upright" shape upside-down); horizontal flip on bottom quadrants biases left but over-applies if shape is centered.
 * Packing into rows with capacity=2*max_h and gap=2 works for simple cases but fails when shapes have varying heights (tall shapes force short rows, causing misalignment); centering assumes global max width but doesn't pad rows evenly.
 * Border addition with thickness=2 is correct and consistent.
 * extract_all_main_shapes is essential and works well for isolation; flood_fill is reliable for components.
 * build_rows and get_all_cells are helpful for packing but produce incorrect offsets in complex layouts (e.g., start_x calculation centers but ignores per-row height variations).
 * The full program handles empty grids but assumes rectangular input; no error for non-uniform row lengths.
 * Unknown reason for exact shape distortions in Training 2 (possibly rotation/flip combo in normalize_shape altering pixel connectivity or bounding).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears malformed or overcomplicated: it generates a very tall (32+ rows) grid with shapes like long horizontal 8/9 bars at top/middle/bottom, vertical 3's on right, scattered 5/6 clusters, but lacks clear row packing—e.g., rows 2-4 have mixed 8 and 3's without gaps, row 11-20 has fragmented 5's extending irregularly (some rows have 13 5's, others partial), and centering is absent (shapes hug left with uneven background). This suggests over-extraction (possibly including small components or misidentifying background=4), failed normalization (bars not rotated to canonical, 5's not squared), or packing errors (capacity too small, leading to many short rows; gaps not enforced). It doesn't match a sensible "catalog" layout—expected would likely be 4-6 compact rows of normalized tetromino-like shapes (e.g., I, O, T, L pieces in colors 3,5,6,8,9) centered with thickness=2 border, shorter and more organized. To handle test, need better normalization (multi-rotation trials for minimal bounding or chirality), dynamic capacity/gap based on shapes, and stricter component filtering.

[2025-10-01 02:56:27] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify the background color, extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors that meet a minimum size threshold, normalize each shape's orientation and position through translations, rotations, and flips to standardize their appearance (e.g., making them "bottom-left justified" based on weight distribution), and then rearrange these normalized shapes into a new compact grid arranged horizontally in the order they appear in the original grid (sorted by top-left position), with added borders and padding to form a square output grid while preserving the original colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most frequent non-zero color as background; ignore zeros and treat them as empty/transparent, but ensure extraction skips background entirely.
 * Shape extraction: Only consider 4-connected (up/down/left/right) components of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise should be omitted. Sort extracted shapes by their minimum row (topmost position), then by minimum column (leftmost within same row) to preserve reading order (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom in original grid).
 * Normalization subtleties: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. If height > width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise to prefer landscape orientation, then re-translate. For vertical flip: Divide bounding box height in half; if bottom half has equal or more cells than top half, flip vertically (upside-down) and re-translate—this prefers "upright" or balanced shapes but can invert if bottom-heavy. For horizontal flip: In the bottom half, if more cells are on the right than left, flip horizontally (mirror left-right) and re-translate—this prefers left-heavy bottoms. Recalculate bounding box after each transformation. These flips/rotations can subtly change how shapes "face" or align, and equal-weight cases flip vertical (which might not always be desired if the puzzle expects "as-is" for balanced shapes).
 * Arrangement: Place normalized shapes side-by-side horizontally in a row, with 1-cell gaps between them (but no leading gap for the first). Use the max height across all shapes for the row height; widths add up with gaps. This creates a rectangular inner grid.
 * Border and padding: Add a thin border (size 1 in this attempt, but expected seems to use size 2 or variable) of background color around the inner grid. Then pad the entire bordered grid to a square by centering it in a larger grid of side length equal to max(outer_height, outer_width), filling extras with background—this ensures square output but can lead to oversized grids if inner arrangement is too wide/tall.
 * Grid sizing issues: Outputs must match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected 12x12, but generated 16x16; train2 expected ~20x28? but generated 32x32). Avoid over-padding or assuming fixed sizes; calculate minimally. Preserve exact cell counts and positions from normalized shapes without overlap or clipping.
 * Color preservation: Keep original colors for shapes; do not change them during normalization or placement.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have uneven shapes, multiple components per color, or shapes touching borders. Zeros are not background but empty—do not treat as shapes. If no shapes, output minimal background grid. Sorting ensures order like reading a book, which might place vertically stacked shapes in input as sequential in output.
 * Potential misses: The >=4 cell threshold works but might filter too aggressively if small shapes are intended. Horizontal arrangement assumes all fit in one row; if too wide, might need multi-row or vertical stacking (not handled here). Border size is inconsistent (attempt uses 1, but expected visuals suggest 2). Flips might over-transform (e.g., equal bottom/top flips vertical, but expected might keep original orientation). Padding centers but can create uneven borders if dimensions differ oddly.

    return color, positions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it correctly identifies background via frequency and extracts components using flood fill with size filter and sorting by position, which isolates main shapes in order.
 * Normalization functions (translate, bounding box, heaviness checks, flips, rotate) are conceptually helpful for standardizing shapes but produce incorrect orientations/flips in outputs (e.g., shapes appear inverted or mirrored compared to expected, possibly due to flipping on equal weights or unnecessary rotations).
 * Horizontal arrangement with gaps works in theory but fails in practice: shapes are placed but with wrong spacing (no gaps in some expected), leading to oversized inner grids; train1 places only partial/wrong shapes (e.g., only 3's visible, missing 8/1), train2 crams multiple shapes into one area without proper separation.
 * Border addition (size 1) and padding to square are implemented but wrong: uses border=1 (expected visuals suggest 2), and padding over-expands (e.g., train1 to 16x16 vs expected 12x12; train2 to 32x32 vs ~20x28; test to ~50x50 vs likely smaller compact square), centering but creating too much empty space.
 * arrange_shapes_horizontal adds +1 gaps between shapes (including after last?), inflating width unnecessarily—expected has tighter packing without consistent gaps.
 * place_shape is basic and correct for overlaying but clips if out-of-bounds (not an issue here).
 * Overall, extraction and normalization are partially working (shapes are detected), but transformation rules are too aggressive/subtle mismatches (e.g., unknown why train1 only shows 3's, perhaps extraction missed colors or sorting failed); arrangement/bordering/padding bloat the grid size and misplace elements.
 * Function add_border is helpful but needs adjustable size (try 2); pad_to_max_dimension is relevant but over-pads—consider minimal square without centering if not needed.
 * Functions like count_cells_in_half, is_bottom_heavy, flip_vertical, count_bottom_left_right, is_bottom_right_heavy, flip_horizontal are tied to normalization and provide weight-based decisions, but may be overkill or incorrect for puzzle (e.g., expected shapes seem unrotated/unflipped in train1/2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an enormously oversized ~50x50 grid (way larger than needed) filled almost entirely with background 4's, with shapes (6,9,8,5) crammed into the bottom rows (rows 20-29) in a dense, non-arranged cluster without horizontal spacing, borders, or proper padding/centering—expected should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with shapes arranged horizontally in sorted order, thin borders, and minimal padding, preserving distinct separated positions like in training examples.
 * Shapes appear partially normalized (e.g., 9's in a block, 6's extended, 8/5 adjacent) but not translated/rotated/flipped correctly, and placement ignores order/sorting, leading to overlap or wrong adjacency; no visible borders, and excessive empty space above suggests failed inner grid calculation or padding explosion.
 * This highlights the same issues as training: over-sized output from bad arrangement + padding, incomplete shape extraction/placement (possibly missed some components or colors), and normalization not matching expected orientations (e.g., if test has tall shapes, rotation might have failed silently).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 possibly empty but backgrounds are non-zero), and the goal is to identify distinct connected shapes (blobs of the same color, excluding the background), normalize their positions and orientations to a standard form, and rearrange them into a new larger grid framed by the background color, with shapes placed in a specific spatial layout (e.g., horizontally adjacent or in rows/columns based on original positions) rather than simply stacked.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other colors represent potential shapes, but only connected components (4-connected, via flood fill) of size >=4 cells are considered "main shapes"—smaller blobs are ignored.
 * Shapes must be extracted per color, taking the largest component per color if multiple exist (as in the code's components_by_color logic).
 * Normalization involves translating the shape to (0,0) top-left, then optionally rotating 90 degrees clockwise if height >= width (to prefer wider orientations?), checking for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top half) and flipping vertically if so, then trimming empty space from top/left to re-minimize bounding box— this seems partially correct but may over-rotate or flip in ways that distort shapes relative to expected outputs.
 * Arrangement is key: the code stacks shapes vertically into a square inner canvas (summing heights, max width, padding to square), then adds a 1-cell border, but expected outputs place shapes horizontally adjacent (e.g., in example 1, 8's left, 1's middle-right, 3's bottom-right; in example 2, shapes like 4's and 6's are split across rows/columns), suggesting sorting by original min row position and placing side-by-side or in a grid layout to fit within a bordered frame matching input dimensions or expanded minimally.
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by min row of positions, which is good for vertical order, but expected seems to preserve horizontal relationships or place in original relative positions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs expand the grid (e.g., example 1 input likely 10x10 becomes 12x12 framed), with empty space filled by background; shapes don't overlap and are not rotated/flipped in ways that change their relative "up" direction—code's bottom-heavy flip may be unnecessary or wrongly applied.
 * Handle empty/whitespace: Grids may have irregular shapes; ensure no overwriting during placement.
 * Colors: Preserve original colors; background frames everything.
 * Edge cases: Multiple components per color (take largest); no shapes (return minimal bg grid); varying input sizes.
 * Puzzle rules imply preserving shape integrity—no scaling, just translation/rotation/flip for canonical form, then precise placement to match a "composed" image where shapes are juxtaposed as if "cut out" and reassembled in a new composition.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the most common non-zero as bg, useful for framing and exclusion.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components per color.)

```python
def extract_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components_by_color = {}
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                size = len(component)
                if size >= 4:
                    if color not in components_by_color or size > len(components_by_color[color][1]):
                        components_by_color[color] = (color, component)
    shapes = list(components_by_color.values())
    shapes.sort(key=lambda x: min(pr for pr, pc in x[1]))
    return shapes
```
(This is helpful for identifying and sorting largest shapes by min row, but may need adjustment to handle multiple per color or different sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2) and extracts main shapes via flood fill, ignoring small components and bg— this worked for finding the right colors and rough positions.
 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors in an input grid, normalize their positions, orientations, and shapes to a standard form (e.g., top-left aligned, possibly rotated or flipped for consistency), and then rearrange them horizontally side-by-side in a new output grid filled with the background color, ensuring the overall output is a square grid with optional bordering padding while preserving the relative internal structure of each shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the dominant color in the grid (most frequent non-zero value), but it may surround shapes or fill large areas; do not treat zero as background unless specified, and ensure shapes are only extracted if they are connected components of the same color with at least a minimum size (e.g., >=4 cells in the code, but this threshold may be arbitrary or unnecessary).
 * Shapes must be extracted via flood fill on connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right), ignoring background and other colors; small or isolated cells (<4) are skipped, which worked but may over-filter if shapes are small.
 * Normalization is crucial: translate shapes to (0,0) origin (min row/col = 0), determine bounding box height/width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise if height > width to make them landscape-oriented, flip horizontally if the bottom half has more mass on the right than left (to standardize "facing" or asymmetry), and re-normalize origin after transformations; this attempts to canonicalize shapes but fails in examples due to incorrect rotation/flipping logic (e.g., over-rotates or flips asymmetrically, leading to distorted placements).
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by minimum row position in original grid (top-to-bottom order of first appearance), which may be correct for reading order but doesn't match expected horizontal left-to-right arrangement in outputs.
 * Placement: Shapes are placed side-by-side horizontally in rows, aligned to the top of the output grid, with their normalized widths added cumulatively; add 1-cell borders top/bottom/left/right around the entire arrangement, then pad to make the output square by adding background rows/columns centered (e.g., if wider than tall, add rows in the middle); total output size should match the minimal square enclosing the bordered arrangement, but code over-pads massively (e.g., +2 borders then squaring leads to oversized grids).
 * Subtleties: Preserve exact relative positions within each shape (no stretching/compression); do not merge shapes or alter colors; output must exactly match expected dimensions and cell values, including background fills; in examples, shapes are abutted directly without gaps between them, but bordered overall; rotations/flips must ensure shapes "face" consistently (e.g., bottom-heavy or asymmetric shapes flipped to standardize); minimum shape size (>=4) skips noise but may miss valid small shapes; background identification counts only non-zero, but if all zero, defaults to 0—ensure it doesn't misidentify shapes as background.
 * Edge cases: Grids with no shapes return single background cell; varying shape sizes require dynamic max height for vertical alignment; if arrangement is taller than wide post-border, pad columns centered; test input has multiple shapes (colors 8,3,5,9,6?) that need sequential horizontal placement without distortion.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid re-processing; use deque for BFS efficiency; counter for background via frequency; handle empty grids; sorting by y-position assumes vertical scanning order, but examples suggest left-to-right or appearance order; final squaring pads symmetrically but code's half = extra//2 may off-center if odd; generated outputs show shapes concatenated horizontally but with wrong normalization (e.g., 8's block is too wide/tall, 1's misplaced), leading to non-matching dimensions (14x14 vs expected 12x12 for train1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This works well for finding the most frequent non-background color as bg, but may need adjustment if bg is zero or sparse.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of the same color, avoiding background and other shapes; use it in future attempts.)

```python
def get_h_w(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in positions)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```
(This correctly computes bounding box height/width from positions; helpful for normalization and placement sizing.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (The full function from the code is partially helpful for origin translation and basic rotation/flip, but broken in rotation logic—if h > w, it rotates but then swaps h/w incorrectly, and flip condition based on bottom-half mass is heuristic but misapplies, leading to distorted shapes; salvage the translation parts but rewrite rotation/flip.)
```
(Partially helpful for translation to (0,0) and bounding box calc, but the rotation (if h>w, rotate to landscape then flip vertically?) and flip (bottom-right > bottom-left mass) are flawed and cause mismatches; do not reuse as-is, but adapt the min_r/min_c normalization.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 for train1, 3 for train2) and extracts components via flood fill, skipping small ones (>=4 cells), which worked for finding main shapes but may be too strict.
 * Normalization attempts to standardize orientation (rotate if tall, flip if asymmetric) but fails: for train1, the 8-shape is rotated/flipped into a 4x4 block instead of expected 4-high x 4-wide with cutout; 1-shape becomes 2x2 but misplaced; 3-shape distorted to 2-high x 6-wide but wrong alignment.
 * Placement sorts shapes by min row (vertical order), then concatenates horizontally with no gaps, adds borders, and pads to square—but over-pads (e.g., train1 becomes 14x14 instead of 12x12, with shapes centered wrongly in rows 6-9 instead of rows 3-10 top-aligned); for train2, shapes are crammed into rows 12-16 with huge background overhead (28x28 vs expected ~20x20), and order wrong (1's,5's,4's,6's misplaced relative to expected vertical-ish but horizontal arrangement).
 * Train1 generated: Shapes horizontally concatenated but normalized wrongly (8's too blocky/wide, 1's shifted right, 3's bottom-heavy flip failed), dimensions oversized with borders, shapes in middle rows 6-9 with top/bottom all-bg rows; expected: 12x12, shapes top-aligned in rows 3-10, 8's left (4w), then 1's (2w), then 3's (6w max), with precise cutouts (e.g., 8's have 2-wide bottom).
 * Train2 generated: All-bg top 11 rows, shapes in 12-16 (1's left, then 5's/4's/6's distorted/wrong widths), bottom all-bg; expected: More compact ~20x20, shapes in scattered rows (e.g., 4's mid-right rows 3-8, 6's lower rows 11-16, 1's bottom rows 19-26, 5's integrated), horizontal but with vertical spacing preserved? Wait, expected seems to rearrange in appearance order horizontally per "section" but code linearizes wrongly.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken (rotation swaps h/w but positions list incorrectly, flip miscalculates mass leading to upside-down or mirrored shapes); do not use as-is.
 * Overall, component extraction essential and works, but sorting/placement/padding logic misses top-alignment, exact widths, and minimal sizing; unknown why train2 expected has shapes not strictly horizontal (e.g., 1's at bottom, 5's overlapping sections)—may need order by first appearance x-then-y, not just y.
 * Test output generated: A massive ~32x48 grid (way oversized from over-padding/squaring), mostly all 4's (bg), with shapes only in rows 18-20 (8's left long block, then 3's/5's/9's/6's concatenated but distorted: 8's 3-high x10-wide instead of structured, 9's 3-high x9-wide blocky, 6's trailing); this does not look correct—expected should be compact square (maybe 20x20+), shapes normalized and top-aligned horizontally in order of appearance (likely 8,3,5,9,6 from positions), preserving cutouts (e.g., 8's probably L or irregular, not solid; 9's stepped, 6's bar-like), with 1-cell borders and centered padding if needed, not this huge empty expanse; differences: wrong dims/shape integrity/placement, shapes merged/distorted without gaps but wrong orientations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it is an oversized rectangular-then-squared grid (~32 rows x 48 cols, padded to square?) with excessive background, shapes only in a narrow band (rows 18-20), and visible distortions (e.g., 8's as solid 10-wide bar instead of expected irregular form with holes/cutouts, 9's blocky without steps, overall not top-aligned or compact).
 * The test output is missing proper normalization (no rotation/flip to standard, leading to raw concatenated widths totaling ~40+), exact shape preservation (flood fill captures but transforms break structure), and minimal sizing (should be ~22x22 bordered square based on max h~8-10, total w~30-40, pad to square).
 * Make sure to account for multiple asymmetric shapes (e.g., 3's small, 5's/6's medium, 9's large stepped, 8's complex) by improving flip/rotate heuristics and sorting by scan order (row-major left-to-right-top-to-bottom) to handle test case; unknown why generated is so vertically centered with huge top/bottom bg, but likely from code's +2 borders then aggressive squaring without trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting connected components (blobs) of the same non-background color from an input grid, filtering out small ones (less than 4 cells), normalizing their positions to a local origin, optionally rotating them to prefer landscape orientation, sorting them by their original top-left positions, and then reassembling them into a new compact grid with a background border and padding to a square shape. The goal is to create a "catalog" or standardized rendering of the extracted shapes while preserving their identities and relative ordering, but the current approach fails in arrangement, leading to mismatched layouts compared to expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color (or 0 if none); all other colors are treated as foreground for components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and same-color; only extract those with >=4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalize each component by translating positions relative to its min_r and min_c, compute its bounding box height (h) and width (w).
 * Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if h > w (tall shapes) to make them wider, updating positions as (c, h-1-r); this prefers horizontal/landscape shapes but may alter visual orientation subtly.
 * Sort extracted shapes by original (min_r, min_c) to process in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, mimicking reading order.
 * Arrangement is critical: current horizontal side-by-side placement creates a thin strip, but expected outputs suggest a more grid-like or vertically stacked layout that preserves relative vertical positioning (e.g., top shapes above bottom ones, with horizontal alignment within rows).
 * Add a 1-cell border of background around the inner arrangement, then pad the entire grid to the nearest square (max dimension) with background, centering the content.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs have consistent sizing (e.g., 12x12 for training 1, 20x20 for training 2), implying the inner arrangement's max_h and total_w determine the final side length after border (+2) and padding.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may overlap or align in the new grid based on original relative positions, but current code ignores vertical offsets and packs everything into one row; also, rotation may misalign shapes if the puzzle expects no rotation or different rotation logic.
 * Handle empty grids or no valid components by returning a single background cell.
 * Outputs use lists of lists, with rows as lists of ints; ensure deep copies to avoid mutation.
 * Potential edge: Shapes with irregular bounding boxes (e.g., L-shapes) must fill their relative positions correctly without gaps in the new grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common non-zero color; useful for distinguishing foreground.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This performs standard 4-connected flood fill for same-color components; essential for extracting blobs accurately.)

```python
def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts and filters components >=4 cells, with min_r/min_c for sorting; core to identifying valid shapes, but note it skips background cells correctly.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    relative = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]
    h = max(r for r, _ in relative) + 1
    w = max(c for _, c in relative) + 1
    return relative, h, w
```
(This normalizes shape positions to (0,0) origin and computes tight bounding box; helpful for isolating shapes.)

```python
def rotate_if_tall(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if h <= w:
        return positions, h, w
    new_positions = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]
    new_h = w
    new_w = h
    return new_positions, new_h, new_w
```
(This rotates tall shapes to landscape; useful but may be a subtlety—puzzle might not require rotation, or it could be causing mismatches in shape orientation.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    new_h = gh + 2
    new_w = gw + 2
    new_grid = [[bg] * new_w for _ in range(new_h)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This adds a 1-cell background border; correct and necessary for framing.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    side = max(gh, gw)
    if gh == 0 or gw == 0:
        return [[bg]]
    if side == gh == gw:
        return [row[:] for row in grid]  # copy
    new_grid = [[bg] * side for _ in range(side)]
    offset_r = (side - gh) // 2
    offset_c = (side - gw) // 2
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[offset_r + i][offset_c + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This centers and pads to square with background; works well but amplifies issues if inner grid is imbalanced.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters components (>=4 cells), normalizes positions, and applies optional rotation, but fails in sorting and arrangement: shapes are sorted by (min_r, min_c) but placed horizontally side-by-side in a single row, creating a thin inner grid (e.g., height ~2-4, wide total_w), leading to many empty rows after bordering and square-padding.
 * For training example 1: Generated a 14x14 grid with all shapes crammed into rows 5-8 (8's left, 1's middle, 3's right, but misaligned and no vertical separation), surrounded by 2's border and top/bottom padding; expected is 12x12 with 8's top-left (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1's top-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9), 3's bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 8-13, horizontal), preserving vertical ordering and compactness—generated mismatches by flattening to one row and oversized padding.
 * For training example 2: Generated a 28x28 grid (way oversized) with 10+ empty rows top/bottom, shapes crammed into rows 11-16 (1's left, 5's scattered, 4's/6's middle-right, but jumbled and no grid structure); expected is 20x20 with shapes in a multi-row layout (4's/5's top-middle rows 2-7, 6's middle rows 10-15, 1's bottom rows 18-25, with vertical stacking and horizontal alignment within "rows" of shapes)—generated differs by horizontal packing, wrong size, and poor alignment (e.g., 1's and 5's fragmented).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order but doesn't account for vertical grouping; build_inner_grid is broken for multi-row arrangements—needs to place shapes in rows based on original min_r buckets or similar.
 * Rotation may be unhelpful or incorrect: e.g., in training 1, 3's is horizontal in expected but might be rotated if tall; don't use if it distorts expected shapes.
 * Flood_fill and extract_raw_components are essential and correct for component detection; translate_to_origin is helpful for normalization.
 * add_border and pad_to_square are correct but highlight arrangement flaws (e.g., thin inner -> empty square).
 * Overall, extraction works (shapes identified correctly), but rearrangement doesn't mimic the expected "poster" or "inventory" layout with vertical stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it's a massive ~48x48? grid (inferred from 48 elements per row) mostly filled with background 4's (empty rows 0-16 and 20-47), with shapes crammed into only rows 17-19 (8's left spanning multiple rows but flattened, 3's/5's/9's/6's jumbled horizontally without vertical separation or alignment, e.g., 8's block rows 17-19 cols 1-9, then scattered smaller blobs like 3's at cols 10-12, 5's at 13-21, etc., ending with 6's right).
 * It differs from what we'd expect (based on training): should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with extracted shapes (8,3,5,9,6 colors visible) arranged in a multi-row grid layout (e.g., larger 8's block top, smaller ones below/right, bordered by 4's, centered), preserving relative original positions vertically; instead, horizontal cramming creates imbalance, no stacking (all in 3 rows), and excessive empty space, suggesting the same arrangement bug as training examples.
 * Shapes seem extracted correctly (e.g., large 8's, 9's block, 6's), but placement ignores vertical offsets—e.g., if test has vertically separated shapes, they should stack, not inline; rotation might have flipped some (unknown if needed).
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too sparse/empty, mismatched size, no visual "catalog" structure; likely fails if test expects similar to training 2's stacked layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains a background color and multiple connected components (shapes) of different colors, and the goal is to extract the "main" shapes (likely those with sufficient size, e.g., >=4 cells), normalize their position and orientation in a canonical way (translating to top-left, possibly rotating/flipping for consistency), and then reassemble them into a new output grid with the same background, arranged in a structured layout (e.g., sorted by original position or color, possibly stacked vertically with borders or spacing to match the expected compositions).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Extract only "main" shapes: Connected components of the same color, excluding the background (identified as the most frequent non-zero color), and filter to those with at least 4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalization is crucial but tricky: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; ensure consistent orientation by rotating clockwise if height > width (to prefer landscape), always flipping vertically (to prefer "upright" or top-heavy?), and conditionally flipping horizontally if the shape is "bottom-right heavy" (more cells in bottom-right quadrant than bottom-left, to prefer left-leaning or balanced asymmetry).
 * Arrangement rules: Shapes should be placed in the output in the order they appear when scanned top-to-bottom, left-to-right (based on the minimum row/col of the component), but stacked vertically rather than horizontally; include spacing or gaps (e.g., 1-2 cells of background) between shapes, and add a uniform border (thickness 2) around the entire composition; the inner grid height should accommodate the tallest shape, but the overall layout expands vertically for multiple shapes.
 * Background handling: Correctly identify as the most common non-zero color (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2, 4 in test); fill all non-shape areas with it; do not treat 0 as background if non-zero colors dominate.
 * Sorting and placement subtleties: After extraction, sort components by their original top-left position (min row, then min col); place each normalized shape at increasing y-positions (vertical stacking) with x-offsets to align left or center; ensure bounding boxes don't overlap and gaps prevent merging; in ex1, the 8-shape is placed highest, 1-shape mid-right, 3-shape lowest-right, suggesting vertical progression with horizontal offsets based on original relative positions.
 * Size and padding: Output should match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., ex1: 12 rows x 12 cols inner? but with border; ex2 taller with more vertical space); add border after inner composition; if no shapes, return a single bg cell.
 * Easy-to-miss elements: Shapes may have irregular forms (e.g., L-shapes or protrusions in ex1's 8 and 3); normalization flips/rotations must preserve connectivity and color but can alter visual "up" direction—over-flipping leads to mismatches (e.g., 3-shape in ex1 appears "upside-down" or mirrored in generated); original positions influence order/placement (not just color); small shapes (<4 cells) are ignored, but in ex2, some 1's and 5's seem split or partial.
 * General: Grids are rectangular; use 4-directional connectivity for flood-fill; handle empty/zero grids gracefully.

(Translation and bounding box utilities; core to normalization, work well but need integration with correct rotation/flip logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters main shapes (>=4 cells), sorts them by original position, and normalizes via translation/rotation/flip, but arranges them horizontally side-by-side with fixed gaps (1 cell), leading to wide, short grids instead of vertical stacking.
 * Train 1 generated a compact 8x18 grid (after border?) with 8-shape left, 1-shape mid, 3-shape right, all at similar heights (rows 2-5), but expected is 12x12 with vertical separation: 8-shape top (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1-shape mid-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9 but lower effective), empty space below 8, then 3-shape bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 4-9 and 8-11); difference: horizontal vs. vertical layout, no vertical spacing, and possible flip mismatch on 3-shape (appears shifted right in generated).
 * Train 2 generated a messy 10x34 horizontal jumble with shapes overlapping or poorly spaced (e.g., 1's and 5's mixed left, 4's and 6's mid-right, extra 5's/6's duplicated?), but expected is ~18x20 with vertical sections: upper 4's/5's stacked, mid 6's horizontal, lower 1's vertical with 5's right; differences: extreme width from horizontal placement, incorrect sorting/placement (e.g., 1's appear low but should be bottom, 5's duplicated or mispositioned), and border adds uneven padding; unknown why some shapes like 5's are split or extra in generated.
 * Normalization flips (always vertical, conditional horizontal) may over-correct, causing shape orientations to mismatch expected (e.g., 3 in ex1 looks "flipped" horizontally in generated vs. expected left-aligned); rotation only if h>w works but doesn't handle all asymmetries.
 * Arrangement uses max height for inner grid but places all at y=0 with x-offsets, ignoring vertical progression; should instead accumulate height with per-shape y-offsets based on order.
 * add_border is helpful and correct (thickness=2, pads uniformly), but applied to wrong inner layout.
 * is_bottom_right_heavy and flip functions are somewhat helpful for asymmetry but may be too aggressive—consider optional or rule-based (e.g., only if > certain imbalance threshold).
 * Overall, extraction/sorting is strong (shapes identified correctly), but layout is the core failure; no unhelpful functions, but the full program() integrates poorly (e.g., current_x accumulation assumes horizontal).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an extremely wide ~13x51 grid (after border) with all shapes (8,3,5,9,6, etc.) crammed horizontally in a single band (mostly rows 2-11), with some vertical extent for taller shapes like 8/9/6 but no true stacking—e.g., 8-shape left tall, then 3/5/9/6 clustered mid-right, all at similar heights with minimal gaps, leading to a linear "strip" composition.
 * It mismatches expected logic from trainings, which use vertical stacking with offsets (e.g., shapes at increasing y-positions, horizontal shifts for alignment); here, everything is side-by-side, causing overlaps or squeezes (e.g., 9-shape protrudes but not separated vertically from 6); border is added correctly, but inner layout is wrong—test likely needs taller grid with shapes like 8 top, 3/5 mid, 9/6 bottom, sorted by original positions, preserving relative x-offsets from input.
 * Does not make sense: Too horizontal and compact, ignores vertical order from extraction sort; possible normalization issues (e.g., 8-shape rotated wrong, appearing stretched); extra bg fills but no spacing between sections.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from a grid, normalizing their orientation and position to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips based on heuristics like bottom-heaviness or right-heaviness), sorting them by original position, and then rearranging them into a new bordered grid with the background color, likely in a packed row-based layout to simulate a "catalog" or standardized display of the shapes while preserving their normalized forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all empty spaces in the output use this.
 * Extract only connected components (4-connected, same color) with at least 4 cells; ignore smaller blobs or single cells.
 * Components must be flood-filled correctly to capture full shapes, even irregular ones like L-shapes or those with protrusions.
 * Normalization is critical: translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; if height > width, rotate 90° clockwise; check for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top) and flip vertically if so (especially after rotation); check for "bottom-right heavy" (in bottom half, more cells on right than left) and flip horizontally if so; re-translate after each transform to keep origin at (0,0).
 * Sorting: Components are sorted by their original minimum row and column (top-left position in source grid), which determines arrangement order.
 * Arrangement: Pack shapes into rows on a new canvas; use a capacity limit (e.g., max_width + max_height of shapes) to decide when to start a new row; add horizontal gaps (e.g., 2 units) between shapes in a row, vertical gaps (e.g., 0) between rows; align shapes left-to-right in rows, top-to-bottom for rows; compute total canvas size based on max row dimensions.
 * Border: Add a uniform border (thickness 2) of background color around the arranged inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations/flips must update bounding box dimensions correctly after each step; "heaviness" checks only apply if height/width >1; arrangement may need to align shapes to a baseline (e.g., bottom-aligned in rows?) or handle varying heights without vertical centering; original positions influence order but not final placement beyond sorting; ensure no overlaps or out-of-bounds writes; the expected outputs show shapes in "canonical" orientations that look standardized (e.g., L-shapes opening rightward or downward), suggesting normalization is key but may need additional rules like preferring certain rotations.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must respect grid bounds and only same-color cells; normalization can chain (e.g., rotate then flip, re-check heaviness); packing may fail if capacity is miscalculated (e.g., too small, causing unnecessary row breaks); shapes like partial rectangles or hooks (e.g., the 3's L-shape) get flipped to a consistent form, but if flips are wrong, they appear mirrored or rotated incorrectly in output; border thickness is fixed at 2, and canvas must be exactly sized to fit with border.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it handles extraction and normalization partially; issues in packing lead to misaligned rows (e.g., shapes starting at wrong x-offsets); test case has multiple rows of shapes (8,5,9,6 with small 3's), suggesting need for multi-row packing without excessive gaps.

```
(These handle translation, bounding box, and basic transforms; core to normalization and work correctly individually, but chaining in normalize_shape needs fixes for re-translation and re-bounding after each step.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    rotated = False
    if h > w:
        positions = rotate_90_cw(positions, h, w)
        rotated = True
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    do_v_flip = rotated or is_bottom_heavy(positions, h)
    if do_v_flip:
        positions = flip_vertical(positions, h)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    if is_bottom_right_heavy(positions, h, w):
        positions = flip_horizontal(positions, w)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    return color, positions
```
(This attempts full normalization but is buggy: is_bottom_heavy and is_bottom_right_heavy definitions may be incorrect—bottom_heavy counts top vs bottom but doesn't specify "heavy" threshold clearly; bottom_right_heavy only checks bottom half and compares left/right counts strictly (>); vertical flip condition ties to rotation oddly; doesn't handle multiple rotations or full 360° normalization; re-bounding after flips is good but heaviness checks may need to be recursive or more robust for irregular shapes.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], thickness: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg for _ in range(nw)] for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This correctly adds a fixed-thickness border; helpful and accurate.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided, but it successfully extracts components (e.g., identifies 8,1,3 in train1 and various in train2/test), normalizes positions to origin, and adds border correctly.
 * What worked: Background detection, flood-fill extraction (captures full shapes >=4 cells), translation to origin, basic rotation/flip mechanics, sorting by original min_r/min_c, and border addition; the inner grid filling avoids overlaps.
 * What didn't work: Normalization heuristics are incomplete—e.g., in train1, the 3-shape (likely an L or hook) isn't flipped/rotated to match expected (generated places it as a left-aligned partial rectangle in row 6-9 cols 6-9, but expected has it right-shifted in row 6-7 cols 8-9 and full in row 8-9 cols 4-9, suggesting wrong canonical orientation); in train2, multiple shapes (1,5,4,6) are packed incorrectly (generated spreads them across rows with wrong alignments, e.g., 1's left then 5's right, but expected groups 4's large in middle-right, 5's small left, 6's bottom, 1's bottom-left with extensions).
 * Arrangement/packing is the main failure: Uses capacity = max_w + max_h (e.g., ~8 for squares), gap_h=2, but breaks rows too early or left-aligns without matching expected offsets (e.g., train1 generated puts 3's at col 6, expected at col 4-9 with gap; train2 generated has vertical stacking issues, e.g., 4's split across rows wrongly); no vertical alignment within rows (shapes may need bottom-alignment); total canvas sizing pads correctly but positions don't match.
 * Sorting works (order seems 8 then 1 then 3 in train1, matching original positions), but downstream packing ignores subtle spacing (e.g., expected has larger gaps or fixed columns).
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is broken/not helpful: Capacity logic causes poor packing (e.g., fits 8+1 in row1 but 3 alone in row2 left-aligned; train2 overflows rows wrongly); gaps are asymmetric (h=2, v=0); doesn't compute max row width correctly for centering or right-alignment; suggest replacing with fixed-grid or better knapsack-style packing.
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is partially helpful but flawed: Simple half-split count works for symmetric cases but fails for irregulars (e.g., L-shapes may not trigger flip correctly; threshold is >= but may need > or weighted center-of-mass).
 * Function `is_bottom_right_heavy` similar issue: Only bottom-half check is good, but strict > count may miss balanced-but-skewed shapes; applied too late in chain.
 * Overall, extraction/normalization gets ~70% right (shapes identifiable), but transform logic and packing need overhaul for orientations and layout to match expected standardized arrangements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it rearranges shapes (large 8/9/5/6 blocks, small 3's) into a multi-row packed grid with border 4, but the layout is misaligned similar to trainings—e.g., 8's top-left spanning rows 2-10 cols 2-11, small 3's awkwardly next to it in rows 2-4 cols 12-15, then 5's below in rows 11-20 with internal structure (suggesting partial normalization of a complex shape), 9's mid-right rows 20-28, 6's bottom rows 29-38; this seems like linear left-to-right packing with row breaks, but expected likely needs better canonical orientations (e.g., all "bottom-left" aligned L's or hooks) and tighter/spaced rows matching original relative positions or a grid-like catalog (e.g., sorted into 2-3 per row with even spacing); small 3's are repeated/clustered oddly, possibly from extraction error or no deduping; overall, it "makes sense" as an attempt at rearrangement but fails subtlety like train cases (wrong flips cause 5/9/6 to appear stretched vertically/horizontally; packing capacity too loose, leading to tall thin canvas instead of compact); to handle test, need to refine heaviness to prefer "opening right/down" for hooks, increase gap_h to 3-4 for alignment, and ensure post-transform bounding boxes trigger correct row heights.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves extracting distinct connected components (shapes) of the same color from an input grid, ignoring small ones (under 4 cells), normalizing each shape's orientation through translations, rotations, and flips to a canonical form (e.g., minimizing height relative to width and balancing cell distribution), sorting them (likely by original top-left position), and rearranging them into a new bordered grid with row-based packing where rows are filled left-to-right without exceeding a width limit based on the tallest shape, but the current implementation's sorting, normalization balancing, and row alignment logic produce incorrect layouts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are connected components of the same non-background color; background is likely the dominant surrounding color (not necessarily the most common non-zero as currently implemented, which can misidentify it if a shape is larger than the background).
 * Ignore components smaller than 4 cells to filter out noise or minor elements.
 * Normalization must produce a unique canonical representation: translate to (0,0) origin, rotate 90° CW repeatedly until height <= width, then optionally flip vertically if the bottom half has more or equal cells than the top, and flip horizontally if the post-flip bottom-right quadrant has more cells than bottom-left; this ensures consistent orientation but can fail if the balancing logic doesn't match the expected "heavier" side correctly (e.g., subtle cell counts in halves/quadrants can lead to wrong flips).
 * Sorting of shapes should be by their original minimum row then minimum column (top-left priority) to preserve input order, but current implementation sorts components this way before normalization, which is good, but downstream placement ignores it.
 * Layout: Use a maximum row width of 2 * global max height for packing; fill rows greedily left-to-right with gaps (e.g., 2 units); for multi-row outputs, align subsequent rows to the right edge of the previous row's content (via prev_end - row_span +1), but this creates incorrect staggering/overlap in examples; add a 2-unit border around the entire inner grid.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must exactly match expected dimensions and positions, including empty background fills; shapes must not overlap or clip; vertical gaps between rows should be 0 or minimal; in examples, shapes like the 3's in train1 appear in specific orientations (e.g., wide horizontal at bottom, narrow vertical at side) suggesting the normalization sometimes needs to prefer certain rotations/flips over others, or perhaps sort by color after position.
 * Background identification: Current counter ignores 0 and picks most common non-zero, but in examples (bg=2 or 3), it works coincidentally but could fail if background is 0 or less common; extraction skips background and 0.
 * Potential misses: Original shapes may have irregular bounding boxes, so post-normalization bounding boxes must be recomputed accurately; flips/rotations change coordinates, requiring re-translation; large grids (like test) need efficient packing without unnecessary empty space.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes, multiple shapes per color (but examples treat same-color connected as one), and ensure the final grid includes full borders even if inner is empty.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it correctly extracts shapes via flood-fill and filters small ones, normalizes orientations (rotation and flips), and adds borders, but fails on layout packing and alignment.
 * Train1: Generated correctly places 8's and 1's in top rows but swaps the 3's—wide horizontal 3's (6-wide) appear in rows 6-7 middle instead of rows 8-9 middle, and narrow vertical 3's (2-wide) in rows 8-9 right instead of rows 6-7 right; this suggests wrong row assignment and possible normalization flip/rotation mismatch for 3's (unknown why, perhaps vertical flip threshold is too loose).
 * Train2: Generated has severely disrupted layout—e.g., 1's and 5's are placed top-middle and scattered, 4's horizontal in middle but shifted left, 6's bottom but with extra rows and misalignments (e.g., 1's span rows 2-5 and 18-25 incorrectly); expected has more compact vertical stacking with 4's/6's centered, 1's/5's side-placed, indicating packing greedily overflows rows and the right-alignment for subsequent rows (prev_end calc) causes staggering/overlap.
 * Sorting by original position works for extraction but is ignored in placement, leading to arbitrary row filling.
 * Normalization balancing (e.g., v_flipped if bottom >= top) produces wrong orientations for asymmetric shapes like the 3's, causing expected vs. generated shape forms to differ (e.g., one vertical, one horizontal).
 * Row packing logic breaks on multi-shape rows: max_row_w = 2*max_h is reasonable but gap=2 and left-to-right greedy fill doesn't center or justify rows correctly; vert_gap=0 is good but current_y += mh + vert_gap skips properly, yet prev_end adjustment for row_start_x misaligns non-first rows to the left instead of right/center.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the full program() integrates them poorly; extract_all_main_shapes and flood_fill are essential and correct, while normalize_shape needs refinement for flip conditions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it produces a large 32x22 grid (after border?) with shapes like 8's (11-wide horizontal top), 3's (3-wide vertical side), 5's (scattered horizontal/vertical middle), 9's (11-wide horizontal bottom), 6's (9-wide horizontal very bottom), but placements show irregularities: e.g., 3's repeat in cols 13-15 across multiple row groups without connection, 5's have a wide 9-cell row 14-16 but narrow above/below suggesting poor packing, and overall staggering (e.g., row starts shift leftward) creates empty spaces and non-compact layout unlike the tighter, vertically stacked expected patterns in trains.
 * Compared to trains, it exacerbates alignment issues: shapes aren't right-justified or centered per row (e.g., 8's and 9's span cols 2-12 but 5's/6's start at col 7, leaving uneven gaps); no expected provided, but mentally simulating rules (extract/normalize/sort by pos/pack rows max 2*max_h~22 wide, border), it should be more uniform without the vertical repetition of side 3's or mid-grid 5's overflow—likely wrong due to same row_start_x bug causing left-drift and normalization failing on complex shapes like 5's/6's (e.g., if they have uneven quadrants, flips misorient).
 * Test highlights scalability issue: with more/larger shapes (colors 3,5,6,8,9), greedy packing creates too many short rows and misaligns, missing subtle rule that rows should be centered or fully left-aligned without prev_end adjustment.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from an input grid, normalize each shape's position and orientation to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips), and then rearrange them into a new grid layout with rows of shapes, gaps between them, centered alignment per row, and a bordered background. The output preserves the original colors and connected structure but standardizes the composition for consistency across inputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most common non-zero color as background (bg); ignore all bg cells during extraction, but do not extract components of the bg color itself even if connected.
 * Shape extraction: Only extract 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same color with size >=4 cells; smaller blobs or single cells are ignored as noise. Sort extracted components by their top-left position (min row, then min col) before processing.
 * Normalization process: Translate all positions to origin (0,0); compute bounding box (h=height, w=width); rotate 90° CW repeatedly until h <= w (track rotations for later flips); for vertical flip decision, count cells in top vs. bottom half—if rotations even and bottom heavier, or rotations odd and top heavier, flip vertically; after vertical flip (if any), check bottom half's left vs. right mass—if right heavier, flip horizontally. This ensures a "standard" orientation minimizing asymmetry.
 * Layout arrangement: After normalization, sort shapes implicitly by extraction order (which is position-based); place into rows where each row's max width is max(h+w across shapes) + gaps; start new row if adding next shape exceeds row width; add gap=2 between shapes in row; center each row by shifting left-aligned content; stack rows vertically with no vertical gaps; final inner grid size based on max row width and total height; add thickness=2 border of bg around the entire inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations affect flip logic (even/odd parity changes vertical mass interpretation); bounding box updates after each transform; components must be exactly same-color connected (flood-fill stops at color mismatch); output grid must match exact dimensions and positions—no extra bg inside shapes or overlaps; preserve original colors (do not remap); if no valid shapes, output single bg cell; extraction skips visited cells to avoid reprocessing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with all bg or tiny shapes return minimal bg grid; shapes touching border or each other are still separate if different colors; normalization can change effective h/w; horizontal flip only after vertical to avoid over-correction; sorting by min position ensures consistent order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

(These form the normalization pipeline; critical for standardizing shapes—translate, rotate until h<=w, conditional flips based on mass distribution. The vertical flip logic depends on rotation parity, which is a subtle but key detail.)

    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg] * nw for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(Helpful for final bordering; ensures consistent padding around the composed inner grid.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core extraction, normalization, and layout logic works for simple cases with fewer shapes or standard orientations.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated output has incorrect shape ordering/placement (e.g., shape 1 appears in top-middle but expected at bottom; shape 5 misplaced to right of 1 instead of left; shape 4's wide bar is split and lower than expected; shape 6's L-shape is rotated/flipped wrong, appearing as a vertical stack instead of horizontal with extension). Dimensions mismatch (generated 20x16 inner? vs expected 20x20 with more even spacing); rows not centered properly (e.g., expected has centered 4-bar spanning most width, but generated has it offset); vertical stacking has extra empty rows or misaligned heights.
 * Normalization likely over-rotates or misapplies flips in training 2 (e.g., shape 4's horizontal bar becomes vertical in generated; shape 1's partial square not flipped to match expected orientation); extraction sorts correctly but layout row-breaking fails when shapes have varying h/w post-normalization.
 * Layout uses max_row_w = max_h + max_w, but this assumes single-shape rows—fails when multiple small shapes fit but code breaks rows prematurely; gap=2 is applied but centering shift = total_w - row_used_w doesn't account for gaps in used_w calc.
 * extract_all_main_shapes is helpful and correct (properly filters >=4, sorts); flood_fill is solid (no leaks across colors).
 * The full program() integrates everything but has bugs in row packing (current_x += sw + gap overflows incorrectly) and inner_grid filling (abs_x = shift + local_x ignores gaps in placement, causing overlaps or shifts).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though normalize_shape's flip conditions may need tuning for asymmetric shapes like L's or partial bars.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It extracts 5+ shapes (colors 3,5,6,8,9) with bg=4, but arrangement is a tall vertical stack (32x18?) with shapes in columns rather than rows—e.g., multiple horizontal bars (8,9) stacked directly, small protrusions like 3's on right of some bars suggest poor normalization (possibly unflipped or unrotated, as 3's look like detached arms); shape 5's complex form (looks like a plus or cross with extensions) spans unevenly, indicating failed bounding/translate after flips; no visible gaps between shapes in "rows," and centering absent (left-heavy alignment); border thickness=2 is applied but inner content overflows or misaligns (e.g., 5's bottom extensions hit border unevenly).
 * Compared to expected (inferred from pattern/rules): Should have shapes normalized (e.g., all bars horizontal with h<=w, L-shapes standardized to bottom-left heavy), sorted by original top-left, packed into 2-3 rows with gap=2 and centering (wider rows like 8/9 bars spanning full width), total inner ~20-24 high x max_row_w wide, no vertical stacking without row breaks—current output mashes everything vertically, missing the row-based horizontal composition.
 * Test highlights normalization issues for tall/thin shapes (e.g., 5 and 6 seem rotated wrong, as their extensions are vertical instead of balanced); layout bug amplified here with more shapes, causing no row breaks (current_x never exceeds due to small sw post-norm?); extraction seems to catch all >=4 (good), but order wrong (e.g., 8 before 3, but 3's small position should sort earlier).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of distinct colored shapes (connected components of non-background cells) from an input grid, normalization of those shapes for canonical orientation and position, and rearrangement into a new output grid that packs the shapes into centered rows with gaps, surrounded by a thick background border. The output preserves the original colors of the shapes while using the input's dominant color as the background, aiming to create a standardized "catalog" or layout of the shapes sorted by their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other cells are treated as shape pixels unless they match this background.
 * Only extract "main" shapes: connected components (4-directional flood fill) of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise are ignored.
 * Shapes must be normalized: translate to (0,0) origin, optionally rotate 90 degrees clockwise once if height != width (to attempt squaring), flip vertically based on top/bottom pixel counts for "upright" orientation, and flip horizontally if the bottom-right quadrant has more pixels than bottom-left (for left-leaning bias).
 * Sorting: Components are sorted by the minimum row of their pixels, then by minimum column, to process in top-to-left order.
 * Packing: Shapes are placed into rows where the total width (including gaps of 2 between shapes) fits a capacity of 2 * max_shape_height; rows are centered horizontally in the final inner grid by calculating used width per row and offsetting from the global max width.
 * Output structure: Inner grid built from packed shapes (no overlaps, background-filled), then wrapped in a thickness=2 border of background color; if no shapes, output a single background cell (or bordered version).
 * Subtleties: Normalization can alter shape appearance (e.g., rotation only once may not always canonicalize rectangles properly; vertical flip logic depends on even/odd rotations and half-point splits, which may misorient asymmetric shapes). Gaps are fixed at 2, but only between shapes in a row (no leading/trailing gaps). Row heights are determined by the tallest shape in the row, with shapes aligned at top-left within their bounding box. Empty rows or single-shape rows must still be centered. Colors are preserved, but if normalization changes positions, it can shift pixel placements. Potential edge cases: all-background input, single-pixel shapes (ignored), non-square shapes that don't normalize well, or shapes touching the border. The output dimensions grow based on content (inner height = sum of row max heights; inner width = max row used width; final = inner + 4 thickness).

```
(These are core for normalization: translation, bounding, and transformations; useful but the full normalize_shape logic needs tuning for accuracy.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled Training example 1, extracting, normalizing, packing, and bordering shapes to match the expected output.
 * For Training example 2, the generated output is INCORRECT: shapes are extracted and normalized but placed in wrong positions and orientations—e.g., color 1 (likely a square or L-shape) appears in rows 2-8 but shifted left and split incorrectly across rows with color 5 and 4 misplaced nearby; color 4 is fragmented and not in the expected long horizontal bar in rows 5-6; color 6 is correctly at bottom but color 5 is in wrong spot; overall layout has extra empty rows and no proper centering, leading to a taller/misaligned grid compared to expected (which has compact rows with 4 at top-right, 5 left-middle, 1 bottom-left, 6 bottom).
 * Sorting by min row/col works for order but fails if shapes overlap in original positions or if normalization rotates them unexpectedly.
 * Normalization is partially helpful but broken/subtle issues: single 90-degree rotation if h!=w forces non-square shapes incorrectly (e.g., long bars become vertical when horizontal expected); vertical flip logic based on half-counts misorients shapes where pixel distribution is even or asymmetric (e.g., may flip an "upright" shape upside-down); horizontal flip on bottom quadrants biases left but over-applies if shape is centered.
 * Packing into rows with capacity=2*max_h and gap=2 works for simple cases but fails when shapes have varying heights (tall shapes force short rows, causing misalignment); centering assumes global max width but doesn't pad rows evenly.
 * Border addition with thickness=2 is correct and consistent.
 * extract_all_main_shapes is essential and works well for isolation; flood_fill is reliable for components.
 * build_rows and get_all_cells are helpful for packing but produce incorrect offsets in complex layouts (e.g., start_x calculation centers but ignores per-row height variations).
 * The full program handles empty grids but assumes rectangular input; no error for non-uniform row lengths.
 * Unknown reason for exact shape distortions in Training 2 (possibly rotation/flip combo in normalize_shape altering pixel connectivity or bounding).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears malformed or overcomplicated: it generates a very tall (32+ rows) grid with shapes like long horizontal 8/9 bars at top/middle/bottom, vertical 3's on right, scattered 5/6 clusters, but lacks clear row packing—e.g., rows 2-4 have mixed 8 and 3's without gaps, row 11-20 has fragmented 5's extending irregularly (some rows have 13 5's, others partial), and centering is absent (shapes hug left with uneven background). This suggests over-extraction (possibly including small components or misidentifying background=4), failed normalization (bars not rotated to canonical, 5's not squared), or packing errors (capacity too small, leading to many short rows; gaps not enforced). It doesn't match a sensible "catalog" layout—expected would likely be 4-6 compact rows of normalized tetromino-like shapes (e.g., I, O, T, L pieces in colors 3,5,6,8,9) centered with thickness=2 border, shorter and more organized. To handle test, need better normalization (multi-rotation trials for minimal bounding or chirality), dynamic capacity/gap based on shapes, and stricter component filtering.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 03:04:07] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "main" shapes (connected components of non-background cells, filtered by size) from an input grid, normalize each shape's position and orientation to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips based on geometric properties), sort them by their original positions, and then repack them into a new compact grid layout with specific packing rules, gaps, alignment, and a surrounding border of background color—all while preserving the original colors of the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; zero (0) represents empty space but is not considered for bg—ensure this doesn't misidentify bg in grids with sparse or uneven color distribution.
 * Only extract "main shapes": connected components (4-directional flood fill) of the same color with size >=4 cells; ignore smaller blobs, single cells, or bg-colored components—subtlety: components must be exactly the same color, and bg cells block connectivity.
 * Normalization is multi-step and asymmetric: (1) Translate to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. (2) Rotate 90° CW repeatedly until height <= width (while h > w), tracking rotation count. (3) Vertical flip decision based on top/bottom half cell counts, but flipped logic depending on even/odd rotations (e.g., for even rotations, flip if bottom >= top; for odd, flip if top >= bottom)—this ensures a "preferred" vertical orientation but can be tricky if halves are equal (no flip). (4) After vertical adjustment, horizontal flip if bottom-right quadrant has more cells than bottom-left (using floor(h/2) and floor(w/2) for quadrants)—this canonicalizes left-right asymmetry. Subtlety: re-translate after each transform, and bounding box (h,w) must be recomputed each time; equal counts in flip decisions default to no flip.
 * Sorting: After extraction, sort shapes by original min row, then min col of their positions (not normalized)—this preserves input order for arrangement but can lead to unexpected row breaks if positions are clustered oddly.
 * Arrangement: Pack shapes into rows greedily left-to-right with horizontal gap=2 between shapes; limit row width to cap=2*max_h (where max_h is global max normalized height) to avoid overly wide rows. Vertical gap=0 between rows. For rows with multiple shapes: left-align at x=0. For single-shape rows: right-align by starting at inner_w - used_w (where inner_w = max used width across all rows)—this creates asymmetric centering that may not visually balance if shapes vary in width. Total inner grid height = sum(row heights) + v_gap*(rows-1); pad inner grid to uniform width with bg. Finally, add a border of thickness=2 all around with bg color—subtlety: this expands dimensions by 4 in each direction, and empty grids return a single bg cell.
 * Edge cases: Empty input or no main shapes → single bg cell. Shapes with h==w after rotation don't rotate further. Quadrant counts use >= half_r for bottom, < half_c for left (floor division, so odd dimensions may unbalance quadrants). Packing may create uneven rows if cap is hit mid-row. Original positions influence sort but not placement offsets.
 * Potential pitfalls: Misidentifying bg leads to extracting bg as a shape. Normalization flips/rotations can alter perceived shape if counts tie (no flip). Single-row right-alignment may not match expected centering. Gap=2 is fixed but may need adjustment if shapes touch in expected output. Sorting by original position assumes top-left priority, but if shapes overlap in min coords, ties may break wrongly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return counts.most_common(1)[0][0] if counts else 0

(This correctly identifies bg as most common non-zero color; useful for filtering.)

```python
def flood_fill(grid: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and grid[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential for extracting connected components accurately via BFS; 4-connected, same-color only.)

```python
def extract_all_main_shapes(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []

    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] != 0 and grid[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = grid[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(grid, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:

    components.sort(key=lambda x: (min(rr for rr, _ in x[1]), min(cc for _, cc in x[1])))
    return components
```
(This reliably extracts and sorts main shapes by original position; key for input processing—size >=4 filter avoids noise.)

    if br_count > bl_count:
        positions = flip_horizontal(positions, w)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    return color, positions
```
(These are core for canonicalization; rotation/flip logic handles asymmetry well but may need tweak for tie cases; translate and bbox are reliable basics.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], thickness: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg] * nw for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This correctly adds uniform border; thickness=2 is fixed but matches examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) succeeded on Training example 1, correctly extracting, normalizing, and arranging simple shapes with proper bg=3, borders, and packing—indicating core extraction and normalization work for basic cases with few shapes.
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated a 20x16 grid (after border) with shapes (1's as 2x8 horizontal bars, 5's as 2x2, 4's as L/varied, 6's as 4x2/2x4) packed in 4 rows but left-aligned overall, with incorrect order (e.g., 1's top-left, then 5's/4's/6's below); dimensions mismatch expected 24x20 (wider due to better packing?); shapes misplaced (e.g., generated has 1's at rows 2-5 cols 2-9, but expected has 1's bottom at rows 19-22 cols 2-5/6-7; 4's expected wider and centered differently; 5's and 6's swapped positions/rotations). Subtlety: likely wrong normalization (e.g., rotations/flips altered shapes differently) or packing (greedy row-breaking hit cap too early, leading to more/narrower rows; single-row alignment right-shifted some shapes oddly).
 * Sorting by original min row/col worked for train1 but may have grouped shapes wrongly in train2 if input positions clustered vertically/horizontally.
 * Packing logic partially worked (gaps=2, v_gap=0, cap=2*max_h) but produced narrower inner_w=12 vs expected ~16, suggesting cap too restrictive or normalization increased widths unevenly.
 * Border addition worked (thickness=2, bg fill), but overall dims wrong due to inner grid errors.
 * Flood fill and extraction helpful and correct (identified all main shapes by color/size), but size >=4 filter may have included/excluded edge blobs if input has them.
 * Normalization functions are helpful but subtle bugs: vertical flip logic (even/odd rotation dependency) may over/under-flip if top/bottom equal; horizontal flip only if br > bl (strict >, so ties keep original); rotation stops at h<=w but doesn't prefer square or minimal bbox.
 * Arrangement code has issues: for len(row)==1, right-align (start_x = inner_w - used_w) may not match expected left/center; multi-row left-align at 0 assumes uniform padding, but max_used inner_w pads right with bg correctly yet leads to asymmetry.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but the full packing/row-building loop is buggy (greedy while loop breaks rows suboptimally; used_w calc assumes temp_start but doesn't account for padding properly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (24x18 grid, bg=4) extracts and arranges 5+ shapes (8's as large 3x9 horizontals, 3's as 3x1 verticals, 5's as extended 5x3/3x9, 9's as 7x3 verticals with protrusions, 6's as 3x9 horizontals) in ~6 rows with gaps and border, but without the test input grid, it's impossible to verify exact correctness—however, it follows the same logic as the failed train2, so likely incorrect in normalization/packing/order.
 * Does not look fully correct: Shapes like 8's and 9's appear over-rotated (e.g., 8's are wide horizontals in rows 2-4/9-11/21-23, but if input had verticals, rotation while h>w may have forced unwanted 90° turns); 5's have irregular extensions (rows 14-20 cols 7-16, looking like a cross or plus, possibly wrong flip); 3's are tiny verticals (rows 2-4/21-23 cols 13-15) placed as "spacers" but may be misextracted if input bg=4 surrounded them oddly. Packing seems greedy (rows break at cap~18? but inner_w=14, leading to left-heavy layout); single-shape rows (e.g., bottom 6's) right-aligned, creating imbalance. Compared to train2 failure, this likely has similar issues: wrong dims (expected may be wider/taller), misplaced shapes (e.g., 3's should integrate differently), and normalization artifacts (e.g., 5's/6's look flipped horizontally incorrectly if br_count == bl_count).
 * Missing elements: No clear centering for all rows (only singles right-aligned, which may not match); potential over-extraction if small 3's blobs <4 cells were included erroneously (but code filters >=4, so maybe input has exactly 3-cell? Wait, code would skip). To handle test, need input grid to confirm, but output doesn't "make sense" as a canonical repack—looks fragmented, with unused space (e.g., cols 16-14 empty in many rows), suggesting packing cap or gap=2 too tight.
 * Account for tests with tall/narrow shapes (e.g., 9's 7-high) by ensuring rotation minimizes height but respects h<=w; variable shape counts (5+ here vs 4 in train2) may need better row balancing beyond greedy.

[2025-10-01 03:04:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify the background color, extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors that meet a minimum size threshold, normalize each shape's orientation and position through translations, rotations, and flips to standardize their appearance (e.g., making them "bottom-left justified" based on weight distribution), and then rearrange these normalized shapes into a new compact grid arranged horizontally in the order they appear in the original grid (sorted by top-left position), with added borders and padding to form a square output grid while preserving the original colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most frequent non-zero color as background; ignore zeros and treat them as empty/transparent, but ensure extraction skips background entirely.
 * Shape extraction: Only consider 4-connected (up/down/left/right) components of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise should be omitted. Sort extracted shapes by their minimum row (topmost position), then by minimum column (leftmost within same row) to preserve reading order (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom in original grid).
 * Normalization subtleties: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. If height > width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise to prefer landscape orientation, then re-translate. For vertical flip: Divide bounding box height in half; if bottom half has equal or more cells than top half, flip vertically (upside-down) and re-translate—this prefers "upright" or balanced shapes but can invert if bottom-heavy. For horizontal flip: In the bottom half, if more cells are on the right than left, flip horizontally (mirror left-right) and re-translate—this prefers left-heavy bottoms. Recalculate bounding box after each transformation. These flips/rotations can subtly change how shapes "face" or align, and equal-weight cases flip vertical (which might not always be desired if the puzzle expects "as-is" for balanced shapes).
 * Arrangement: Place normalized shapes side-by-side horizontally in a row, with 1-cell gaps between them (but no leading gap for the first). Use the max height across all shapes for the row height; widths add up with gaps. This creates a rectangular inner grid.
 * Border and padding: Add a thin border (size 1 in this attempt, but expected seems to use size 2 or variable) of background color around the inner grid. Then pad the entire bordered grid to a square by centering it in a larger grid of side length equal to max(outer_height, outer_width), filling extras with background—this ensures square output but can lead to oversized grids if inner arrangement is too wide/tall.
 * Grid sizing issues: Outputs must match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected 12x12, but generated 16x16; train2 expected ~20x28? but generated 32x32). Avoid over-padding or assuming fixed sizes; calculate minimally. Preserve exact cell counts and positions from normalized shapes without overlap or clipping.
 * Color preservation: Keep original colors for shapes; do not change them during normalization or placement.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have uneven shapes, multiple components per color, or shapes touching borders. Zeros are not background but empty—do not treat as shapes. If no shapes, output minimal background grid. Sorting ensures order like reading a book, which might place vertically stacked shapes in input as sequential in output.
 * Potential misses: The >=4 cell threshold works but might filter too aggressively if small shapes are intended. Horizontal arrangement assumes all fit in one row; if too wide, might need multi-row or vertical stacking (not handled here). Border size is inconsistent (attempt uses 1, but expected visuals suggest 2). Flips might over-transform (e.g., equal bottom/top flips vertical, but expected might keep original orientation). Padding centers but can create uneven borders if dimensions differ oddly.

        positions = flip_horizontal(positions, w)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    return color, positions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it correctly identifies background via frequency and extracts components using flood fill with size filter and sorting by position, which isolates main shapes in order.
 * Normalization functions (translate, bounding box, heaviness checks, flips, rotate) are conceptually helpful for standardizing shapes but produce incorrect orientations/flips in outputs (e.g., shapes appear inverted or mirrored compared to expected, possibly due to flipping on equal weights or unnecessary rotations).
 * Horizontal arrangement with gaps works in theory but fails in practice: shapes are placed but with wrong spacing (no gaps in some expected), leading to oversized inner grids; train1 places only partial/wrong shapes (e.g., only 3's visible, missing 8/1), train2 crams multiple shapes into one area without proper separation.
 * Border addition (size 1) and padding to square are implemented but wrong: uses border=1 (expected visuals suggest 2), and padding over-expands (e.g., train1 to 16x16 vs expected 12x12; train2 to 32x32 vs ~20x28; test to ~50x50 vs likely smaller compact square), centering but creating too much empty space.
 * arrange_shapes_horizontal adds +1 gaps between shapes (including after last?), inflating width unnecessarily—expected has tighter packing without consistent gaps.
 * place_shape is basic and correct for overlaying but clips if out-of-bounds (not an issue here).
 * Overall, extraction and normalization are partially working (shapes are detected), but transformation rules are too aggressive/subtle mismatches (e.g., unknown why train1 only shows 3's, perhaps extraction missed colors or sorting failed); arrangement/bordering/padding bloat the grid size and misplace elements.
 * Function add_border is helpful but needs adjustable size (try 2); pad_to_max_dimension is relevant but over-pads—consider minimal square without centering if not needed.
 * Functions like count_cells_in_half, is_bottom_heavy, flip_vertical, count_bottom_left_right, is_bottom_right_heavy, flip_horizontal are tied to normalization and provide weight-based decisions, but may be overkill or incorrect for puzzle (e.g., expected shapes seem unrotated/unflipped in train1/2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an enormously oversized ~50x50 grid (way larger than needed) filled almost entirely with background 4's, with shapes (6,9,8,5) crammed into the bottom rows (rows 20-29) in a dense, non-arranged cluster without horizontal spacing, borders, or proper padding/centering—expected should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with shapes arranged horizontally in sorted order, thin borders, and minimal padding, preserving distinct separated positions like in training examples.
 * Shapes appear partially normalized (e.g., 9's in a block, 6's extended, 8/5 adjacent) but not translated/rotated/flipped correctly, and placement ignores order/sorting, leading to overlap or wrong adjacency; no visible borders, and excessive empty space above suggests failed inner grid calculation or padding explosion.
 * This highlights the same issues as training: over-sized output from bad arrangement + padding, incomplete shape extraction/placement (possibly missed some components or colors), and normalization not matching expected orientations (e.g., if test has tall shapes, rotation might have failed silently).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 possibly empty but backgrounds are non-zero), and the goal is to identify distinct connected shapes (blobs of the same color, excluding the background), normalize their positions and orientations to a standard form, and rearrange them into a new larger grid framed by the background color, with shapes placed in a specific spatial layout (e.g., horizontally adjacent or in rows/columns based on original positions) rather than simply stacked.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other colors represent potential shapes, but only connected components (4-connected, via flood fill) of size >=4 cells are considered "main shapes"—smaller blobs are ignored.
 * Shapes must be extracted per color, taking the largest component per color if multiple exist (as in the code's components_by_color logic).
 * Normalization involves translating the shape to (0,0) top-left, then optionally rotating 90 degrees clockwise if height >= width (to prefer wider orientations?), checking for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top half) and flipping vertically if so, then trimming empty space from top/left to re-minimize bounding box— this seems partially correct but may over-rotate or flip in ways that distort shapes relative to expected outputs.
 * Arrangement is key: the code stacks shapes vertically into a square inner canvas (summing heights, max width, padding to square), then adds a 1-cell border, but expected outputs place shapes horizontally adjacent (e.g., in example 1, 8's left, 1's middle-right, 3's bottom-right; in example 2, shapes like 4's and 6's are split across rows/columns), suggesting sorting by original min row position and placing side-by-side or in a grid layout to fit within a bordered frame matching input dimensions or expanded minimally.
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by min row of positions, which is good for vertical order, but expected seems to preserve horizontal relationships or place in original relative positions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs expand the grid (e.g., example 1 input likely 10x10 becomes 12x12 framed), with empty space filled by background; shapes don't overlap and are not rotated/flipped in ways that change their relative "up" direction—code's bottom-heavy flip may be unnecessary or wrongly applied.
 * Handle empty/whitespace: Grids may have irregular shapes; ensure no overwriting during placement.
 * Colors: Preserve original colors; background frames everything.
 * Edge cases: Multiple components per color (take largest); no shapes (return minimal bg grid); varying input sizes.
 * Puzzle rules imply preserving shape integrity—no scaling, just translation/rotation/flip for canonical form, then precise placement to match a "composed" image where shapes are juxtaposed as if "cut out" and reassembled in a new composition.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the most common non-zero as bg, useful for framing and exclusion.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])

    visited[sr][sc] = True

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc

                    if color not in components_by_color or size > len(components_by_color[color][1]):
                        components_by_color[color] = (color, component)
    shapes = list(components_by_color.values())
    shapes.sort(key=lambda x: min(pr for pr, pc in x[1]))
    return shapes
```
(This is helpful for identifying and sorting largest shapes by min row, but may need adjustment to handle multiple per color or different sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2) and extracts main shapes via flood fill, ignoring small components and bg— this worked for finding the right colors and rough positions.
 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors in an input grid, normalize their positions, orientations, and shapes to a standard form (e.g., top-left aligned, possibly rotated or flipped for consistency), and then rearrange them horizontally side-by-side in a new output grid filled with the background color, ensuring the overall output is a square grid with optional bordering padding while preserving the relative internal structure of each shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the dominant color in the grid (most frequent non-zero value), but it may surround shapes or fill large areas; do not treat zero as background unless specified, and ensure shapes are only extracted if they are connected components of the same color with at least a minimum size (e.g., >=4 cells in the code, but this threshold may be arbitrary or unnecessary).
 * Shapes must be extracted via flood fill on connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right), ignoring background and other colors; small or isolated cells (<4) are skipped, which worked but may over-filter if shapes are small.
 * Normalization is crucial: translate shapes to (0,0) origin (min row/col = 0), determine bounding box height/width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise if height > width to make them landscape-oriented, flip horizontally if the bottom half has more mass on the right than left (to standardize "facing" or asymmetry), and re-normalize origin after transformations; this attempts to canonicalize shapes but fails in examples due to incorrect rotation/flipping logic (e.g., over-rotates or flips asymmetrically, leading to distorted placements).
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by minimum row position in original grid (top-to-bottom order of first appearance), which may be correct for reading order but doesn't match expected horizontal left-to-right arrangement in outputs.
 * Placement: Shapes are placed side-by-side horizontally in rows, aligned to the top of the output grid, with their normalized widths added cumulatively; add 1-cell borders top/bottom/left/right around the entire arrangement, then pad to make the output square by adding background rows/columns centered (e.g., if wider than tall, add rows in the middle); total output size should match the minimal square enclosing the bordered arrangement, but code over-pads massively (e.g., +2 borders then squaring leads to oversized grids).
 * Subtleties: Preserve exact relative positions within each shape (no stretching/compression); do not merge shapes or alter colors; output must exactly match expected dimensions and cell values, including background fills; in examples, shapes are abutted directly without gaps between them, but bordered overall; rotations/flips must ensure shapes "face" consistently (e.g., bottom-heavy or asymmetric shapes flipped to standardize); minimum shape size (>=4) skips noise but may miss valid small shapes; background identification counts only non-zero, but if all zero, defaults to 0—ensure it doesn't misidentify shapes as background.
 * Edge cases: Grids with no shapes return single background cell; varying shape sizes require dynamic max height for vertical alignment; if arrangement is taller than wide post-border, pad columns centered; test input has multiple shapes (colors 8,3,5,9,6?) that need sequential horizontal placement without distortion.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid re-processing; use deque for BFS efficiency; counter for background via frequency; handle empty grids; sorting by y-position assumes vertical scanning order, but examples suggest left-to-right or appearance order; final squaring pads symmetrically but code's half = extra//2 may off-center if odd; generated outputs show shapes concatenated horizontally but with wrong normalization (e.g., 8's block is too wide/tall, 1's misplaced), leading to non-matching dimensions (14x14 vs expected 12x12 for train1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This works well for finding the most frequent non-background color as bg, but may need adjustment if bg is zero or sparse.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of the same color, avoiding background and other shapes; use it in future attempts.)

```python
def get_h_w(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in positions)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```
(This correctly computes bounding box height/width from positions; helpful for normalization and placement sizing.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (The full function from the code is partially helpful for origin translation and basic rotation/flip, but broken in rotation logic—if h > w, it rotates but then swaps h/w incorrectly, and flip condition based on bottom-half mass is heuristic but misapplies, leading to distorted shapes; salvage the translation parts but rewrite rotation/flip.)
```
(Partially helpful for translation to (0,0) and bounding box calc, but the rotation (if h>w, rotate to landscape then flip vertically?) and flip (bottom-right > bottom-left mass) are flawed and cause mismatches; do not reuse as-is, but adapt the min_r/min_c normalization.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 for train1, 3 for train2) and extracts components via flood fill, skipping small ones (>=4 cells), which worked for finding main shapes but may be too strict.
 * Normalization attempts to standardize orientation (rotate if tall, flip if asymmetric) but fails: for train1, the 8-shape is rotated/flipped into a 4x4 block instead of expected 4-high x 4-wide with cutout; 1-shape becomes 2x2 but misplaced; 3-shape distorted to 2-high x 6-wide but wrong alignment.
 * Placement sorts shapes by min row (vertical order), then concatenates horizontally with no gaps, adds borders, and pads to square—but over-pads (e.g., train1 becomes 14x14 instead of 12x12, with shapes centered wrongly in rows 6-9 instead of rows 3-10 top-aligned); for train2, shapes are crammed into rows 12-16 with huge background overhead (28x28 vs expected ~20x20), and order wrong (1's,5's,4's,6's misplaced relative to expected vertical-ish but horizontal arrangement).
 * Train1 generated: Shapes horizontally concatenated but normalized wrongly (8's too blocky/wide, 1's shifted right, 3's bottom-heavy flip failed), dimensions oversized with borders, shapes in middle rows 6-9 with top/bottom all-bg rows; expected: 12x12, shapes top-aligned in rows 3-10, 8's left (4w), then 1's (2w), then 3's (6w max), with precise cutouts (e.g., 8's have 2-wide bottom).
 * Train2 generated: All-bg top 11 rows, shapes in 12-16 (1's left, then 5's/4's/6's distorted/wrong widths), bottom all-bg; expected: More compact ~20x20, shapes in scattered rows (e.g., 4's mid-right rows 3-8, 6's lower rows 11-16, 1's bottom rows 19-26, 5's integrated), horizontal but with vertical spacing preserved? Wait, expected seems to rearrange in appearance order horizontally per "section" but code linearizes wrongly.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken (rotation swaps h/w but positions list incorrectly, flip miscalculates mass leading to upside-down or mirrored shapes); do not use as-is.
 * Overall, component extraction essential and works, but sorting/placement/padding logic misses top-alignment, exact widths, and minimal sizing; unknown why train2 expected has shapes not strictly horizontal (e.g., 1's at bottom, 5's overlapping sections)—may need order by first appearance x-then-y, not just y.
 * Test output generated: A massive ~32x48 grid (way oversized from over-padding/squaring), mostly all 4's (bg), with shapes only in rows 18-20 (8's left long block, then 3's/5's/9's/6's concatenated but distorted: 8's 3-high x10-wide instead of structured, 9's 3-high x9-wide blocky, 6's trailing); this does not look correct—expected should be compact square (maybe 20x20+), shapes normalized and top-aligned horizontally in order of appearance (likely 8,3,5,9,6 from positions), preserving cutouts (e.g., 8's probably L or irregular, not solid; 9's stepped, 6's bar-like), with 1-cell borders and centered padding if needed, not this huge empty expanse; differences: wrong dims/shape integrity/placement, shapes merged/distorted without gaps but wrong orientations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it is an oversized rectangular-then-squared grid (~32 rows x 48 cols, padded to square?) with excessive background, shapes only in a narrow band (rows 18-20), and visible distortions (e.g., 8's as solid 10-wide bar instead of expected irregular form with holes/cutouts, 9's blocky without steps, overall not top-aligned or compact).
 * The test output is missing proper normalization (no rotation/flip to standard, leading to raw concatenated widths totaling ~40+), exact shape preservation (flood fill captures but transforms break structure), and minimal sizing (should be ~22x22 bordered square based on max h~8-10, total w~30-40, pad to square).
 * Make sure to account for multiple asymmetric shapes (e.g., 3's small, 5's/6's medium, 9's large stepped, 8's complex) by improving flip/rotate heuristics and sorting by scan order (row-major left-to-right-top-to-bottom) to handle test case; unknown why generated is so vertically centered with huge top/bottom bg, but likely from code's +2 borders then aggressive squaring without trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting connected components (blobs) of the same non-background color from an input grid, filtering out small ones (less than 4 cells), normalizing their positions to a local origin, optionally rotating them to prefer landscape orientation, sorting them by their original top-left positions, and then reassembling them into a new compact grid with a background border and padding to a square shape. The goal is to create a "catalog" or standardized rendering of the extracted shapes while preserving their identities and relative ordering, but the current approach fails in arrangement, leading to mismatched layouts compared to expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color (or 0 if none); all other colors are treated as foreground for components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and same-color; only extract those with >=4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalize each component by translating positions relative to its min_r and min_c, compute its bounding box height (h) and width (w).
 * Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if h > w (tall shapes) to make them wider, updating positions as (c, h-1-r); this prefers horizontal/landscape shapes but may alter visual orientation subtly.
 * Sort extracted shapes by original (min_r, min_c) to process in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, mimicking reading order.
 * Arrangement is critical: current horizontal side-by-side placement creates a thin strip, but expected outputs suggest a more grid-like or vertically stacked layout that preserves relative vertical positioning (e.g., top shapes above bottom ones, with horizontal alignment within rows).
 * Add a 1-cell border of background around the inner arrangement, then pad the entire grid to the nearest square (max dimension) with background, centering the content.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs have consistent sizing (e.g., 12x12 for training 1, 20x20 for training 2), implying the inner arrangement's max_h and total_w determine the final side length after border (+2) and padding.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may overlap or align in the new grid based on original relative positions, but current code ignores vertical offsets and packs everything into one row; also, rotation may misalign shapes if the puzzle expects no rotation or different rotation logic.
 * Handle empty grids or no valid components by returning a single background cell.
 * Outputs use lists of lists, with rows as lists of ints; ensure deep copies to avoid mutation.
 * Potential edge: Shapes with irregular bounding boxes (e.g., L-shapes) must fill their relative positions correctly without gaps in the new grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common non-zero color; useful for distinguishing foreground.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This performs standard 4-connected flood fill for same-color components; essential for extracting blobs accurately.)

```python
def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts and filters components >=4 cells, with min_r/min_c for sorting; core to identifying valid shapes, but note it skips background cells correctly.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    relative = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]
    h = max(r for r, _ in relative) + 1
    w = max(c for _, c in relative) + 1
    return relative, h, w
```
(This normalizes shape positions to (0,0) origin and computes tight bounding box; helpful for isolating shapes.)

```python
def rotate_if_tall(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if h <= w:
        return positions, h, w
    new_positions = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]
    new_h = w
    new_w = h
    return new_positions, new_h, new_w
```
(This rotates tall shapes to landscape; useful but may be a subtlety—puzzle might not require rotation, or it could be causing mismatches in shape orientation.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    new_h = gh + 2
    new_w = gw + 2
    new_grid = [[bg] * new_w for _ in range(new_h)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This adds a 1-cell background border; correct and necessary for framing.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    side = max(gh, gw)
    if gh == 0 or gw == 0:
        return [[bg]]
    if side == gh == gw:
        return [row[:] for row in grid]  # copy
    new_grid = [[bg] * side for _ in range(side)]
    offset_r = (side - gh) // 2
    offset_c = (side - gw) // 2
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[offset_r + i][offset_c + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This centers and pads to square with background; works well but amplifies issues if inner grid is imbalanced.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters components (>=4 cells), normalizes positions, and applies optional rotation, but fails in sorting and arrangement: shapes are sorted by (min_r, min_c) but placed horizontally side-by-side in a single row, creating a thin inner grid (e.g., height ~2-4, wide total_w), leading to many empty rows after bordering and square-padding.
 * For training example 1: Generated a 14x14 grid with all shapes crammed into rows 5-8 (8's left, 1's middle, 3's right, but misaligned and no vertical separation), surrounded by 2's border and top/bottom padding; expected is 12x12 with 8's top-left (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1's top-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9), 3's bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 8-13, horizontal), preserving vertical ordering and compactness—generated mismatches by flattening to one row and oversized padding.
 * For training example 2: Generated a 28x28 grid (way oversized) with 10+ empty rows top/bottom, shapes crammed into rows 11-16 (1's left, 5's scattered, 4's/6's middle-right, but jumbled and no grid structure); expected is 20x20 with shapes in a multi-row layout (4's/5's top-middle rows 2-7, 6's middle rows 10-15, 1's bottom rows 18-25, with vertical stacking and horizontal alignment within "rows" of shapes)—generated differs by horizontal packing, wrong size, and poor alignment (e.g., 1's and 5's fragmented).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order but doesn't account for vertical grouping; build_inner_grid is broken for multi-row arrangements—needs to place shapes in rows based on original min_r buckets or similar.
 * Rotation may be unhelpful or incorrect: e.g., in training 1, 3's is horizontal in expected but might be rotated if tall; don't use if it distorts expected shapes.
 * Flood_fill and extract_raw_components are essential and correct for component detection; translate_to_origin is helpful for normalization.
 * add_border and pad_to_square are correct but highlight arrangement flaws (e.g., thin inner -> empty square).
 * Overall, extraction works (shapes identified correctly), but rearrangement doesn't mimic the expected "poster" or "inventory" layout with vertical stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it's a massive ~48x48? grid (inferred from 48 elements per row) mostly filled with background 4's (empty rows 0-16 and 20-47), with shapes crammed into only rows 17-19 (8's left spanning multiple rows but flattened, 3's/5's/9's/6's jumbled horizontally without vertical separation or alignment, e.g., 8's block rows 17-19 cols 1-9, then scattered smaller blobs like 3's at cols 10-12, 5's at 13-21, etc., ending with 6's right).
 * It differs from what we'd expect (based on training): should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with extracted shapes (8,3,5,9,6 colors visible) arranged in a multi-row grid layout (e.g., larger 8's block top, smaller ones below/right, bordered by 4's, centered), preserving relative original positions vertically; instead, horizontal cramming creates imbalance, no stacking (all in 3 rows), and excessive empty space, suggesting the same arrangement bug as training examples.
 * Shapes seem extracted correctly (e.g., large 8's, 9's block, 6's), but placement ignores vertical offsets—e.g., if test has vertically separated shapes, they should stack, not inline; rotation might have flipped some (unknown if needed).
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too sparse/empty, mismatched size, no visual "catalog" structure; likely fails if test expects similar to training 2's stacked layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains a background color and multiple connected components (shapes) of different colors, and the goal is to extract the "main" shapes (likely those with sufficient size, e.g., >=4 cells), normalize their position and orientation in a canonical way (translating to top-left, possibly rotating/flipping for consistency), and then reassemble them into a new output grid with the same background, arranged in a structured layout (e.g., sorted by original position or color, possibly stacked vertically with borders or spacing to match the expected compositions).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Extract only "main" shapes: Connected components of the same color, excluding the background (identified as the most frequent non-zero color), and filter to those with at least 4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalization is crucial but tricky: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; ensure consistent orientation by rotating clockwise if height > width (to prefer landscape), always flipping vertically (to prefer "upright" or top-heavy?), and conditionally flipping horizontally if the shape is "bottom-right heavy" (more cells in bottom-right quadrant than bottom-left, to prefer left-leaning or balanced asymmetry).
 * Arrangement rules: Shapes should be placed in the output in the order they appear when scanned top-to-bottom, left-to-right (based on the minimum row/col of the component), but stacked vertically rather than horizontally; include spacing or gaps (e.g., 1-2 cells of background) between shapes, and add a uniform border (thickness 2) around the entire composition; the inner grid height should accommodate the tallest shape, but the overall layout expands vertically for multiple shapes.
 * Background handling: Correctly identify as the most common non-zero color (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2, 4 in test); fill all non-shape areas with it; do not treat 0 as background if non-zero colors dominate.
 * Sorting and placement subtleties: After extraction, sort components by their original top-left position (min row, then min col); place each normalized shape at increasing y-positions (vertical stacking) with x-offsets to align left or center; ensure bounding boxes don't overlap and gaps prevent merging; in ex1, the 8-shape is placed highest, 1-shape mid-right, 3-shape lowest-right, suggesting vertical progression with horizontal offsets based on original relative positions.
 * Size and padding: Output should match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., ex1: 12 rows x 12 cols inner? but with border; ex2 taller with more vertical space); add border after inner composition; if no shapes, return a single bg cell.
 * Easy-to-miss elements: Shapes may have irregular forms (e.g., L-shapes or protrusions in ex1's 8 and 3); normalization flips/rotations must preserve connectivity and color but can alter visual "up" direction—over-flipping leads to mismatches (e.g., 3-shape in ex1 appears "upside-down" or mirrored in generated); original positions influence order/placement (not just color); small shapes (<4 cells) are ignored, but in ex2, some 1's and 5's seem split or partial.
 * General: Grids are rectangular; use 4-directional connectivity for flood-fill; handle empty/zero grids gracefully.

(Translation and bounding box utilities; core to normalization, work well but need integration with correct rotation/flip logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters main shapes (>=4 cells), sorts them by original position, and normalizes via translation/rotation/flip, but arranges them horizontally side-by-side with fixed gaps (1 cell), leading to wide, short grids instead of vertical stacking.
 * Train 1 generated a compact 8x18 grid (after border?) with 8-shape left, 1-shape mid, 3-shape right, all at similar heights (rows 2-5), but expected is 12x12 with vertical separation: 8-shape top (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1-shape mid-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9 but lower effective), empty space below 8, then 3-shape bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 4-9 and 8-11); difference: horizontal vs. vertical layout, no vertical spacing, and possible flip mismatch on 3-shape (appears shifted right in generated).
 * Train 2 generated a messy 10x34 horizontal jumble with shapes overlapping or poorly spaced (e.g., 1's and 5's mixed left, 4's and 6's mid-right, extra 5's/6's duplicated?), but expected is ~18x20 with vertical sections: upper 4's/5's stacked, mid 6's horizontal, lower 1's vertical with 5's right; differences: extreme width from horizontal placement, incorrect sorting/placement (e.g., 1's appear low but should be bottom, 5's duplicated or mispositioned), and border adds uneven padding; unknown why some shapes like 5's are split or extra in generated.
 * Normalization flips (always vertical, conditional horizontal) may over-correct, causing shape orientations to mismatch expected (e.g., 3 in ex1 looks "flipped" horizontally in generated vs. expected left-aligned); rotation only if h>w works but doesn't handle all asymmetries.
 * Arrangement uses max height for inner grid but places all at y=0 with x-offsets, ignoring vertical progression; should instead accumulate height with per-shape y-offsets based on order.
 * add_border is helpful and correct (thickness=2, pads uniformly), but applied to wrong inner layout.
 * is_bottom_right_heavy and flip functions are somewhat helpful for asymmetry but may be too aggressive—consider optional or rule-based (e.g., only if > certain imbalance threshold).
 * Overall, extraction/sorting is strong (shapes identified correctly), but layout is the core failure; no unhelpful functions, but the full program() integrates poorly (e.g., current_x accumulation assumes horizontal).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an extremely wide ~13x51 grid (after border) with all shapes (8,3,5,9,6, etc.) crammed horizontally in a single band (mostly rows 2-11), with some vertical extent for taller shapes like 8/9/6 but no true stacking—e.g., 8-shape left tall, then 3/5/9/6 clustered mid-right, all at similar heights with minimal gaps, leading to a linear "strip" composition.
 * It mismatches expected logic from trainings, which use vertical stacking with offsets (e.g., shapes at increasing y-positions, horizontal shifts for alignment); here, everything is side-by-side, causing overlaps or squeezes (e.g., 9-shape protrudes but not separated vertically from 6); border is added correctly, but inner layout is wrong—test likely needs taller grid with shapes like 8 top, 3/5 mid, 9/6 bottom, sorted by original positions, preserving relative x-offsets from input.
 * Does not make sense: Too horizontal and compact, ignores vertical order from extraction sort; possible normalization issues (e.g., 8-shape rotated wrong, appearing stretched); extra bg fills but no spacing between sections.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from a grid, normalizing their orientation and position to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips based on heuristics like bottom-heaviness or right-heaviness), sorting them by original position, and then rearranging them into a new bordered grid with the background color, likely in a packed row-based layout to simulate a "catalog" or standardized display of the shapes while preserving their normalized forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all empty spaces in the output use this.
 * Extract only connected components (4-connected, same color) with at least 4 cells; ignore smaller blobs or single cells.
 * Components must be flood-filled correctly to capture full shapes, even irregular ones like L-shapes or those with protrusions.
 * Normalization is critical: translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; if height > width, rotate 90° clockwise; check for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top) and flip vertically if so (especially after rotation); check for "bottom-right heavy" (in bottom half, more cells on right than left) and flip horizontally if so; re-translate after each transform to keep origin at (0,0).
 * Sorting: Components are sorted by their original minimum row and column (top-left position in source grid), which determines arrangement order.
 * Arrangement: Pack shapes into rows on a new canvas; use a capacity limit (e.g., max_width + max_height of shapes) to decide when to start a new row; add horizontal gaps (e.g., 2 units) between shapes in a row, vertical gaps (e.g., 0) between rows; align shapes left-to-right in rows, top-to-bottom for rows; compute total canvas size based on max row dimensions.
 * Border: Add a uniform border (thickness 2) of background color around the arranged inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations/flips must update bounding box dimensions correctly after each step; "heaviness" checks only apply if height/width >1; arrangement may need to align shapes to a baseline (e.g., bottom-aligned in rows?) or handle varying heights without vertical centering; original positions influence order but not final placement beyond sorting; ensure no overlaps or out-of-bounds writes; the expected outputs show shapes in "canonical" orientations that look standardized (e.g., L-shapes opening rightward or downward), suggesting normalization is key but may need additional rules like preferring certain rotations.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must respect grid bounds and only same-color cells; normalization can chain (e.g., rotate then flip, re-check heaviness); packing may fail if capacity is miscalculated (e.g., too small, causing unnecessary row breaks); shapes like partial rectangles or hooks (e.g., the 3's L-shape) get flipped to a consistent form, but if flips are wrong, they appear mirrored or rotated incorrectly in output; border thickness is fixed at 2, and canvas must be exactly sized to fit with border.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it handles extraction and normalization partially; issues in packing lead to misaligned rows (e.g., shapes starting at wrong x-offsets); test case has multiple rows of shapes (8,5,9,6 with small 3's), suggesting need for multi-row packing without excessive gaps.

    return [(r, w - 1 - c) for r, c in positions]
```
(These handle translation, bounding box, and basic transforms; core to normalization and work correctly individually, but chaining in normalize_shape needs fixes for re-translation and re-bounding after each step.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    rotated = False
    if h > w:
        positions = rotate_90_cw(positions, h, w)
        rotated = True
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    do_v_flip = rotated or is_bottom_heavy(positions, h)
    if do_v_flip:
        positions = flip_vertical(positions, h)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    if is_bottom_right_heavy(positions, h, w):
        positions = flip_horizontal(positions, w)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    return color, positions
```
(This attempts full normalization but is buggy: is_bottom_heavy and is_bottom_right_heavy definitions may be incorrect—bottom_heavy counts top vs bottom but doesn't specify "heavy" threshold clearly; bottom_right_heavy only checks bottom half and compares left/right counts strictly (>); vertical flip condition ties to rotation oddly; doesn't handle multiple rotations or full 360° normalization; re-bounding after flips is good but heaviness checks may need to be recursive or more robust for irregular shapes.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], thickness: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg for _ in range(nw)] for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This correctly adds a fixed-thickness border; helpful and accurate.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided, but it successfully extracts components (e.g., identifies 8,1,3 in train1 and various in train2/test), normalizes positions to origin, and adds border correctly.
 * What worked: Background detection, flood-fill extraction (captures full shapes >=4 cells), translation to origin, basic rotation/flip mechanics, sorting by original min_r/min_c, and border addition; the inner grid filling avoids overlaps.
 * What didn't work: Normalization heuristics are incomplete—e.g., in train1, the 3-shape (likely an L or hook) isn't flipped/rotated to match expected (generated places it as a left-aligned partial rectangle in row 6-9 cols 6-9, but expected has it right-shifted in row 6-7 cols 8-9 and full in row 8-9 cols 4-9, suggesting wrong canonical orientation); in train2, multiple shapes (1,5,4,6) are packed incorrectly (generated spreads them across rows with wrong alignments, e.g., 1's left then 5's right, but expected groups 4's large in middle-right, 5's small left, 6's bottom, 1's bottom-left with extensions).
 * Arrangement/packing is the main failure: Uses capacity = max_w + max_h (e.g., ~8 for squares), gap_h=2, but breaks rows too early or left-aligns without matching expected offsets (e.g., train1 generated puts 3's at col 6, expected at col 4-9 with gap; train2 generated has vertical stacking issues, e.g., 4's split across rows wrongly); no vertical alignment within rows (shapes may need bottom-alignment); total canvas sizing pads correctly but positions don't match.
 * Sorting works (order seems 8 then 1 then 3 in train1, matching original positions), but downstream packing ignores subtle spacing (e.g., expected has larger gaps or fixed columns).
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is broken/not helpful: Capacity logic causes poor packing (e.g., fits 8+1 in row1 but 3 alone in row2 left-aligned; train2 overflows rows wrongly); gaps are asymmetric (h=2, v=0); doesn't compute max row width correctly for centering or right-alignment; suggest replacing with fixed-grid or better knapsack-style packing.
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is partially helpful but flawed: Simple half-split count works for symmetric cases but fails for irregulars (e.g., L-shapes may not trigger flip correctly; threshold is >= but may need > or weighted center-of-mass).
 * Function `is_bottom_right_heavy` similar issue: Only bottom-half check is good, but strict > count may miss balanced-but-skewed shapes; applied too late in chain.
 * Overall, extraction/normalization gets ~70% right (shapes identifiable), but transform logic and packing need overhaul for orientations and layout to match expected standardized arrangements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it rearranges shapes (large 8/9/5/6 blocks, small 3's) into a multi-row packed grid with border 4, but the layout is misaligned similar to trainings—e.g., 8's top-left spanning rows 2-10 cols 2-11, small 3's awkwardly next to it in rows 2-4 cols 12-15, then 5's below in rows 11-20 with internal structure (suggesting partial normalization of a complex shape), 9's mid-right rows 20-28, 6's bottom rows 29-38; this seems like linear left-to-right packing with row breaks, but expected likely needs better canonical orientations (e.g., all "bottom-left" aligned L's or hooks) and tighter/spaced rows matching original relative positions or a grid-like catalog (e.g., sorted into 2-3 per row with even spacing); small 3's are repeated/clustered oddly, possibly from extraction error or no deduping; overall, it "makes sense" as an attempt at rearrangement but fails subtlety like train cases (wrong flips cause 5/9/6 to appear stretched vertically/horizontally; packing capacity too loose, leading to tall thin canvas instead of compact); to handle test, need to refine heaviness to prefer "opening right/down" for hooks, increase gap_h to 3-4 for alignment, and ensure post-transform bounding boxes trigger correct row heights.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves extracting distinct connected components (shapes) of the same color from an input grid, ignoring small ones (under 4 cells), normalizing each shape's orientation through translations, rotations, and flips to a canonical form (e.g., minimizing height relative to width and balancing cell distribution), sorting them (likely by original top-left position), and rearranging them into a new bordered grid with row-based packing where rows are filled left-to-right without exceeding a width limit based on the tallest shape, but the current implementation's sorting, normalization balancing, and row alignment logic produce incorrect layouts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are connected components of the same non-background color; background is likely the dominant surrounding color (not necessarily the most common non-zero as currently implemented, which can misidentify it if a shape is larger than the background).
 * Ignore components smaller than 4 cells to filter out noise or minor elements.
 * Normalization must produce a unique canonical representation: translate to (0,0) origin, rotate 90° CW repeatedly until height <= width, then optionally flip vertically if the bottom half has more or equal cells than the top, and flip horizontally if the post-flip bottom-right quadrant has more cells than bottom-left; this ensures consistent orientation but can fail if the balancing logic doesn't match the expected "heavier" side correctly (e.g., subtle cell counts in halves/quadrants can lead to wrong flips).
 * Sorting of shapes should be by their original minimum row then minimum column (top-left priority) to preserve input order, but current implementation sorts components this way before normalization, which is good, but downstream placement ignores it.
 * Layout: Use a maximum row width of 2 * global max height for packing; fill rows greedily left-to-right with gaps (e.g., 2 units); for multi-row outputs, align subsequent rows to the right edge of the previous row's content (via prev_end - row_span +1), but this creates incorrect staggering/overlap in examples; add a 2-unit border around the entire inner grid.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must exactly match expected dimensions and positions, including empty background fills; shapes must not overlap or clip; vertical gaps between rows should be 0 or minimal; in examples, shapes like the 3's in train1 appear in specific orientations (e.g., wide horizontal at bottom, narrow vertical at side) suggesting the normalization sometimes needs to prefer certain rotations/flips over others, or perhaps sort by color after position.
 * Background identification: Current counter ignores 0 and picks most common non-zero, but in examples (bg=2 or 3), it works coincidentally but could fail if background is 0 or less common; extraction skips background and 0.
 * Potential misses: Original shapes may have irregular bounding boxes, so post-normalization bounding boxes must be recomputed accurately; flips/rotations change coordinates, requiring re-translation; large grids (like test) need efficient packing without unnecessary empty space.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes, multiple shapes per color (but examples treat same-color connected as one), and ensure the final grid includes full borders even if inner is empty.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it correctly extracts shapes via flood-fill and filters small ones, normalizes orientations (rotation and flips), and adds borders, but fails on layout packing and alignment.
 * Train1: Generated correctly places 8's and 1's in top rows but swaps the 3's—wide horizontal 3's (6-wide) appear in rows 6-7 middle instead of rows 8-9 middle, and narrow vertical 3's (2-wide) in rows 8-9 right instead of rows 6-7 right; this suggests wrong row assignment and possible normalization flip/rotation mismatch for 3's (unknown why, perhaps vertical flip threshold is too loose).
 * Train2: Generated has severely disrupted layout—e.g., 1's and 5's are placed top-middle and scattered, 4's horizontal in middle but shifted left, 6's bottom but with extra rows and misalignments (e.g., 1's span rows 2-5 and 18-25 incorrectly); expected has more compact vertical stacking with 4's/6's centered, 1's/5's side-placed, indicating packing greedily overflows rows and the right-alignment for subsequent rows (prev_end calc) causes staggering/overlap.
 * Sorting by original position works for extraction but is ignored in placement, leading to arbitrary row filling.
 * Normalization balancing (e.g., v_flipped if bottom >= top) produces wrong orientations for asymmetric shapes like the 3's, causing expected vs. generated shape forms to differ (e.g., one vertical, one horizontal).
 * Row packing logic breaks on multi-shape rows: max_row_w = 2*max_h is reasonable but gap=2 and left-to-right greedy fill doesn't center or justify rows correctly; vert_gap=0 is good but current_y += mh + vert_gap skips properly, yet prev_end adjustment for row_start_x misaligns non-first rows to the left instead of right/center.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the full program() integrates them poorly; extract_all_main_shapes and flood_fill are essential and correct, while normalize_shape needs refinement for flip conditions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it produces a large 32x22 grid (after border?) with shapes like 8's (11-wide horizontal top), 3's (3-wide vertical side), 5's (scattered horizontal/vertical middle), 9's (11-wide horizontal bottom), 6's (9-wide horizontal very bottom), but placements show irregularities: e.g., 3's repeat in cols 13-15 across multiple row groups without connection, 5's have a wide 9-cell row 14-16 but narrow above/below suggesting poor packing, and overall staggering (e.g., row starts shift leftward) creates empty spaces and non-compact layout unlike the tighter, vertically stacked expected patterns in trains.
 * Compared to trains, it exacerbates alignment issues: shapes aren't right-justified or centered per row (e.g., 8's and 9's span cols 2-12 but 5's/6's start at col 7, leaving uneven gaps); no expected provided, but mentally simulating rules (extract/normalize/sort by pos/pack rows max 2*max_h~22 wide, border), it should be more uniform without the vertical repetition of side 3's or mid-grid 5's overflow—likely wrong due to same row_start_x bug causing left-drift and normalization failing on complex shapes like 5's/6's (e.g., if they have uneven quadrants, flips misorient).
 * Test highlights scalability issue: with more/larger shapes (colors 3,5,6,8,9), greedy packing creates too many short rows and misaligns, missing subtle rule that rows should be centered or fully left-aligned without prev_end adjustment.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from an input grid, normalize each shape's position and orientation to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips), and then rearrange them into a new grid layout with rows of shapes, gaps between them, centered alignment per row, and a bordered background. The output preserves the original colors and connected structure but standardizes the composition for consistency across inputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most common non-zero color as background (bg); ignore all bg cells during extraction, but do not extract components of the bg color itself even if connected.
 * Shape extraction: Only extract 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same color with size >=4 cells; smaller blobs or single cells are ignored as noise. Sort extracted components by their top-left position (min row, then min col) before processing.
 * Normalization process: Translate all positions to origin (0,0); compute bounding box (h=height, w=width); rotate 90° CW repeatedly until h <= w (track rotations for later flips); for vertical flip decision, count cells in top vs. bottom half—if rotations even and bottom heavier, or rotations odd and top heavier, flip vertically; after vertical flip (if any), check bottom half's left vs. right mass—if right heavier, flip horizontally. This ensures a "standard" orientation minimizing asymmetry.
 * Layout arrangement: After normalization, sort shapes implicitly by extraction order (which is position-based); place into rows where each row's max width is max(h+w across shapes) + gaps; start new row if adding next shape exceeds row width; add gap=2 between shapes in row; center each row by shifting left-aligned content; stack rows vertically with no vertical gaps; final inner grid size based on max row width and total height; add thickness=2 border of bg around the entire inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations affect flip logic (even/odd parity changes vertical mass interpretation); bounding box updates after each transform; components must be exactly same-color connected (flood-fill stops at color mismatch); output grid must match exact dimensions and positions—no extra bg inside shapes or overlaps; preserve original colors (do not remap); if no valid shapes, output single bg cell; extraction skips visited cells to avoid reprocessing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with all bg or tiny shapes return minimal bg grid; shapes touching border or each other are still separate if different colors; normalization can change effective h/w; horizontal flip only after vertical to avoid over-correction; sorting by min position ensures consistent order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

(These form the normalization pipeline; critical for standardizing shapes—translate, rotate until h<=w, conditional flips based on mass distribution. The vertical flip logic depends on rotation parity, which is a subtle but key detail.)

```python

    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg] * nw for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(Helpful for final bordering; ensures consistent padding around the composed inner grid.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core extraction, normalization, and layout logic works for simple cases with fewer shapes or standard orientations.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated output has incorrect shape ordering/placement (e.g., shape 1 appears in top-middle but expected at bottom; shape 5 misplaced to right of 1 instead of left; shape 4's wide bar is split and lower than expected; shape 6's L-shape is rotated/flipped wrong, appearing as a vertical stack instead of horizontal with extension). Dimensions mismatch (generated 20x16 inner? vs expected 20x20 with more even spacing); rows not centered properly (e.g., expected has centered 4-bar spanning most width, but generated has it offset); vertical stacking has extra empty rows or misaligned heights.
 * Normalization likely over-rotates or misapplies flips in training 2 (e.g., shape 4's horizontal bar becomes vertical in generated; shape 1's partial square not flipped to match expected orientation); extraction sorts correctly but layout row-breaking fails when shapes have varying h/w post-normalization.
 * Layout uses max_row_w = max_h + max_w, but this assumes single-shape rows—fails when multiple small shapes fit but code breaks rows prematurely; gap=2 is applied but centering shift = total_w - row_used_w doesn't account for gaps in used_w calc.
 * extract_all_main_shapes is helpful and correct (properly filters >=4, sorts); flood_fill is solid (no leaks across colors).
 * The full program() integrates everything but has bugs in row packing (current_x += sw + gap overflows incorrectly) and inner_grid filling (abs_x = shift + local_x ignores gaps in placement, causing overlaps or shifts).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though normalize_shape's flip conditions may need tuning for asymmetric shapes like L's or partial bars.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It extracts 5+ shapes (colors 3,5,6,8,9) with bg=4, but arrangement is a tall vertical stack (32x18?) with shapes in columns rather than rows—e.g., multiple horizontal bars (8,9) stacked directly, small protrusions like 3's on right of some bars suggest poor normalization (possibly unflipped or unrotated, as 3's look like detached arms); shape 5's complex form (looks like a plus or cross with extensions) spans unevenly, indicating failed bounding/translate after flips; no visible gaps between shapes in "rows," and centering absent (left-heavy alignment); border thickness=2 is applied but inner content overflows or misaligns (e.g., 5's bottom extensions hit border unevenly).
 * Compared to expected (inferred from pattern/rules): Should have shapes normalized (e.g., all bars horizontal with h<=w, L-shapes standardized to bottom-left heavy), sorted by original top-left, packed into 2-3 rows with gap=2 and centering (wider rows like 8/9 bars spanning full width), total inner ~20-24 high x max_row_w wide, no vertical stacking without row breaks—current output mashes everything vertically, missing the row-based horizontal composition.
 * Test highlights normalization issues for tall/thin shapes (e.g., 5 and 6 seem rotated wrong, as their extensions are vertical instead of balanced); layout bug amplified here with more shapes, causing no row breaks (current_x never exceeds due to small sw post-norm?); extraction seems to catch all >=4 (good), but order wrong (e.g., 8 before 3, but 3's small position should sort earlier).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of distinct colored shapes (connected components of non-background cells) from an input grid, normalization of those shapes for canonical orientation and position, and rearrangement into a new output grid that packs the shapes into centered rows with gaps, surrounded by a thick background border. The output preserves the original colors of the shapes while using the input's dominant color as the background, aiming to create a standardized "catalog" or layout of the shapes sorted by their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other cells are treated as shape pixels unless they match this background.
 * Only extract "main" shapes: connected components (4-directional flood fill) of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise are ignored.
 * Shapes must be normalized: translate to (0,0) origin, optionally rotate 90 degrees clockwise once if height != width (to attempt squaring), flip vertically based on top/bottom pixel counts for "upright" orientation, and flip horizontally if the bottom-right quadrant has more pixels than bottom-left (for left-leaning bias).
 * Sorting: Components are sorted by the minimum row of their pixels, then by minimum column, to process in top-to-left order.
 * Packing: Shapes are placed into rows where the total width (including gaps of 2 between shapes) fits a capacity of 2 * max_shape_height; rows are centered horizontally in the final inner grid by calculating used width per row and offsetting from the global max width.
 * Output structure: Inner grid built from packed shapes (no overlaps, background-filled), then wrapped in a thickness=2 border of background color; if no shapes, output a single background cell (or bordered version).
 * Subtleties: Normalization can alter shape appearance (e.g., rotation only once may not always canonicalize rectangles properly; vertical flip logic depends on even/odd rotations and half-point splits, which may misorient asymmetric shapes). Gaps are fixed at 2, but only between shapes in a row (no leading/trailing gaps). Row heights are determined by the tallest shape in the row, with shapes aligned at top-left within their bounding box. Empty rows or single-shape rows must still be centered. Colors are preserved, but if normalization changes positions, it can shift pixel placements. Potential edge cases: all-background input, single-pixel shapes (ignored), non-square shapes that don't normalize well, or shapes touching the border. The output dimensions grow based on content (inner height = sum of row max heights; inner width = max row used width; final = inner + 4 thickness).

 * For Training example 2, the generated output is INCORRECT: shapes are extracted and normalized but placed in wrong positions and orientations—e.g., color 1 (likely a square or L-shape) appears in rows 2-8 but shifted left and split incorrectly across rows with color 5 and 4 misplaced nearby; color 4 is fragmented and not in the expected long horizontal bar in rows 5-6; color 6 is correctly at bottom but color 5 is in wrong spot; overall layout has extra empty rows and no proper centering, leading to a taller/misaligned grid compared to expected (which has compact rows with 4 at top-right, 5 left-middle, 1 bottom-left, 6 bottom).
 * Sorting by min row/col works for order but fails if shapes overlap in original positions or if normalization rotates them unexpectedly.
 * Normalization is partially helpful but broken/subtle issues: single 90-degree rotation if h!=w forces non-square shapes incorrectly (e.g., long bars become vertical when horizontal expected); vertical flip logic based on half-counts misorients shapes where pixel distribution is even or asymmetric (e.g., may flip an "upright" shape upside-down); horizontal flip on bottom quadrants biases left but over-applies if shape is centered.
 * Packing into rows with capacity=2*max_h and gap=2 works for simple cases but fails when shapes have varying heights (tall shapes force short rows, causing misalignment); centering assumes global max width but doesn't pad rows evenly.
 * Border addition with thickness=2 is correct and consistent.
 * extract_all_main_shapes is essential and works well for isolation; flood_fill is reliable for components.
 * build_rows and get_all_cells are helpful for packing but produce incorrect offsets in complex layouts (e.g., start_x calculation centers but ignores per-row height variations).
 * The full program handles empty grids but assumes rectangular input; no error for non-uniform row lengths.
 * Unknown reason for exact shape distortions in Training 2 (possibly rotation/flip combo in normalize_shape altering pixel connectivity or bounding).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears malformed or overcomplicated: it generates a very tall (32+ rows) grid with shapes like long horizontal 8/9 bars at top/middle/bottom, vertical 3's on right, scattered 5/6 clusters, but lacks clear row packing—e.g., rows 2-4 have mixed 8 and 3's without gaps, row 11-20 has fragmented 5's extending irregularly (some rows have 13 5's, others partial), and centering is absent (shapes hug left with uneven background). This suggests over-extraction (possibly including small components or misidentifying background=4), failed normalization (bars not rotated to canonical, 5's not squared), or packing errors (capacity too small, leading to many short rows; gaps not enforced). It doesn't match a sensible "catalog" layout—expected would likely be 4-6 compact rows of normalized tetromino-like shapes (e.g., I, O, T, L pieces in colors 3,5,6,8,9) centered with thickness=2 border, shorter and more organized. To handle test, need better normalization (multi-rotation trials for minimal bounding or chirality), dynamic capacity/gap based on shapes, and stricter component filtering.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "main" shapes (connected components of non-background cells, filtered by size) from an input grid, normalize each shape's position and orientation to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips based on geometric properties), sort them by their original positions, and then repack them into a new compact grid layout with specific packing rules, gaps, alignment, and a surrounding border of background color—all while preserving the original colors of the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; zero (0) represents empty space but is not considered for bg—ensure this doesn't misidentify bg in grids with sparse or uneven color distribution.
 * Only extract "main shapes": connected components (4-directional flood fill) of the same color with size >=4 cells; ignore smaller blobs, single cells, or bg-colored components—subtlety: components must be exactly the same color, and bg cells block connectivity.
 * Normalization is multi-step and asymmetric: (1) Translate to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. (2) Rotate 90° CW repeatedly until height <= width (while h > w), tracking rotation count. (3) Vertical flip decision based on top/bottom half cell counts, but flipped logic depending on even/odd rotations (e.g., for even rotations, flip if bottom >= top; for odd, flip if top >= bottom)—this ensures a "preferred" vertical orientation but can be tricky if halves are equal (no flip). (4) After vertical adjustment, horizontal flip if bottom-right quadrant has more cells than bottom-left (using floor(h/2) and floor(w/2) for quadrants)—this canonicalizes left-right asymmetry. Subtlety: re-translate after each transform, and bounding box (h,w) must be recomputed each time; equal counts in flip decisions default to no flip.
 * Sorting: After extraction, sort shapes by original min row, then min col of their positions (not normalized)—this preserves input order for arrangement but can lead to unexpected row breaks if positions are clustered oddly.
 * Arrangement: Pack shapes into rows greedily left-to-right with horizontal gap=2 between shapes; limit row width to cap=2*max_h (where max_h is global max normalized height) to avoid overly wide rows. Vertical gap=0 between rows. For rows with multiple shapes: left-align at x=0. For single-shape rows: right-align by starting at inner_w - used_w (where inner_w = max used width across all rows)—this creates asymmetric centering that may not visually balance if shapes vary in width. Total inner grid height = sum(row heights) + v_gap*(rows-1); pad inner grid to uniform width with bg. Finally, add a border of thickness=2 all around with bg color—subtlety: this expands dimensions by 4 in each direction, and empty grids return a single bg cell.
 * Edge cases: Empty input or no main shapes → single bg cell. Shapes with h==w after rotation don't rotate further. Quadrant counts use >= half_r for bottom, < half_c for left (floor division, so odd dimensions may unbalance quadrants). Packing may create uneven rows if cap is hit mid-row. Original positions influence sort but not placement offsets.
 * Potential pitfalls: Misidentifying bg leads to extracting bg as a shape. Normalization flips/rotations can alter perceived shape if counts tie (no flip). Single-row right-alignment may not match expected centering. Gap=2 is fixed but may need adjustment if shapes touch in expected output. Sorting by original position assumes top-left priority, but if shapes overlap in min coords, ties may break wrongly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def identify_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    counts = Counter()
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0:
                counts[cell] += 1
    return counts.most_common(1)[0][0] if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most common non-zero color; useful for filtering.)

```python
def flood_fill(grid: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    queue = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    component = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and grid[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential for extracting connected components accurately via BFS; 4-connected, same-color only.)

```python
def extract_all_main_shapes(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] != 0 and grid[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = grid[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(grid, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    components.append((color, comp))
    components.sort(key=lambda x: (min(rr for rr, _ in x[1]), min(cc for _, cc in x[1])))
    return components
```
(This reliably extracts and sorts main shapes by original position; key for input processing—size >=4 filter avoids noise.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if not positions:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]

def get_bounding_box(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1

def rotate_90_cw(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]

def flip_vertical(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(h - 1 - r, c) for r, c in positions]

def flip_horizontal(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(r, w - 1 - c) for r, c in positions]

def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    rotations = 0
    while h > w:
        positions = rotate_90_cw(positions, h, w)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
        rotations += 1
    half = h // 2
    top_count = sum(1 for r, _ in positions if r < half)
    bottom_count = len(positions) - top_count
    flip_v = False
    if rotations % 2 == 0:
        if bottom_count >= top_count:
            flip_v = True
    else:
        if top_count >= bottom_count:
            flip_v = True
    if flip_v:
        positions = flip_vertical(positions, h)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    half_r = h // 2
    half_c = w // 2
    bl_count = sum(1 for r, c in positions if r >= half_r and c < half_c)
    br_count = sum(1 for r, c in positions if r >= half_r and c >= half_c)
    if br_count > bl_count:
        positions = flip_horizontal(positions, w)
        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
    return color, positions
```
(These are core for canonicalization; rotation/flip logic handles asymmetry well but may need tweak for tie cases; translate and bbox are reliable basics.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], thickness: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg] * nw for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This correctly adds uniform border; thickness=2 is fixed but matches examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) succeeded on Training example 1, correctly extracting, normalizing, and arranging simple shapes with proper bg=3, borders, and packing—indicating core extraction and normalization work for basic cases with few shapes.
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated a 20x16 grid (after border) with shapes (1's as 2x8 horizontal bars, 5's as 2x2, 4's as L/varied, 6's as 4x2/2x4) packed in 4 rows but left-aligned overall, with incorrect order (e.g., 1's top-left, then 5's/4's/6's below); dimensions mismatch expected 24x20 (wider due to better packing?); shapes misplaced (e.g., generated has 1's at rows 2-5 cols 2-9, but expected has 1's bottom at rows 19-22 cols 2-5/6-7; 4's expected wider and centered differently; 5's and 6's swapped positions/rotations). Subtlety: likely wrong normalization (e.g., rotations/flips altered shapes differently) or packing (greedy row-breaking hit cap too early, leading to more/narrower rows; single-row alignment right-shifted some shapes oddly).
 * Sorting by original min row/col worked for train1 but may have grouped shapes wrongly in train2 if input positions clustered vertically/horizontally.
 * Packing logic partially worked (gaps=2, v_gap=0, cap=2*max_h) but produced narrower inner_w=12 vs expected ~16, suggesting cap too restrictive or normalization increased widths unevenly.
 * Border addition worked (thickness=2, bg fill), but overall dims wrong due to inner grid errors.
 * Flood fill and extraction helpful and correct (identified all main shapes by color/size), but size >=4 filter may have included/excluded edge blobs if input has them.
 * Normalization functions are helpful but subtle bugs: vertical flip logic (even/odd rotation dependency) may over/under-flip if top/bottom equal; horizontal flip only if br > bl (strict >, so ties keep original); rotation stops at h<=w but doesn't prefer square or minimal bbox.
 * Arrangement code has issues: for len(row)==1, right-align (start_x = inner_w - used_w) may not match expected left/center; multi-row left-align at 0 assumes uniform padding, but max_used inner_w pads right with bg correctly yet leads to asymmetry.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but the full packing/row-building loop is buggy (greedy while loop breaks rows suboptimally; used_w calc assumes temp_start but doesn't account for padding properly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (24x18 grid, bg=4) extracts and arranges 5+ shapes (8's as large 3x9 horizontals, 3's as 3x1 verticals, 5's as extended 5x3/3x9, 9's as 7x3 verticals with protrusions, 6's as 3x9 horizontals) in ~6 rows with gaps and border, but without the test input grid, it's impossible to verify exact correctness—however, it follows the same logic as the failed train2, so likely incorrect in normalization/packing/order.
 * Does not look fully correct: Shapes like 8's and 9's appear over-rotated (e.g., 8's are wide horizontals in rows 2-4/9-11/21-23, but if input had verticals, rotation while h>w may have forced unwanted 90° turns); 5's have irregular extensions (rows 14-20 cols 7-16, looking like a cross or plus, possibly wrong flip); 3's are tiny verticals (rows 2-4/21-23 cols 13-15) placed as "spacers" but may be misextracted if input bg=4 surrounded them oddly. Packing seems greedy (rows break at cap~18? but inner_w=14, leading to left-heavy layout); single-shape rows (e.g., bottom 6's) right-aligned, creating imbalance. Compared to train2 failure, this likely has similar issues: wrong dims (expected may be wider/taller), misplaced shapes (e.g., 3's should integrate differently), and normalization artifacts (e.g., 5's/6's look flipped horizontally incorrectly if br_count == bl_count).
 * Missing elements: No clear centering for all rows (only singles right-aligned, which may not match); potential over-extraction if small 3's blobs <4 cells were included erroneously (but code filters >=4, so maybe input has exactly 3-cell? Wait, code would skip). To handle test, need input grid to confirm, but output doesn't "make sense" as a canonical repack—looks fragmented, with unused space (e.g., cols 16-14 empty in many rows), suggesting packing cap or gap=2 too tight.
 * Account for tests with tall/narrow shapes (e.g., 9's 7-high) by ensuring rotation minimizes height but respects h<=w; variable shape counts (5+ here vs 4 in train2) may need better row balancing beyond greedy.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 03:09:27] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from a grid (considering only components with 4+ cells), normalizing their positions, orientations, and flips to a canonical form, and then rearranging them into a new bordered grid in a packed layout sorted by original position, likely to create a "catalog" or standardized arrangement of the shapes while preserving their colors and relative topologies.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Extract only "main" shapes: Connected components (4-directional flood fill) of the same color, excluding background (most common color) and small components (<4 cells); ignore isolated cells or tiny groups.
 * Normalization is multi-step and orientation-sensitive: Translate to (0,0) origin; rotate 90° CW repeatedly until height <= width (to prefer landscape); for vertical flip, compare mass above/below midline (favor more mass on top, but logic flips based on rotations %2 and top/bottom counts); for horizontal flip, compare mass in bottom-left vs bottom-right quadrants (favor more in bottom-left). This ensures shapes are in a "standard" pose, but the flip conditions are asymmetric and depend on parity of rotations, which can lead to inconsistencies if not handled carefully.
 * Sorting: Components sorted by original min row, then min column in the input grid, to process in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
 * Layout packing: Use a row-based packing with max row width = 2 * max normalized height (cap), gap=2 between shapes; start new row when next shape won't fit; in new row, place at x=0 or slightly overlapping previous row's end (max(0, last_row_end - w +1), which can cause slight overlaps or shifts); compute total dimensions from placements, fill with background, add 2-cell border.
 * Background identification: Most frequent non-zero color; if all zero, use 0.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Rotations change coordinate interpretations (e.g., vertical mass comparison inverts after odd rotations); flip logic isn't symmetric (e.g., vertical flip only if bottom >= top in even rotations, or top >= bottom in odd); horizontal flip only checks bottom half; bounding box after each transform; placement logic can misalign rows if previous row ends near cap, leading to suboptimal packing or unintended overlaps; shapes must retain exact relative positions after normalization but absolute offsets are discarded; output must match exact dimensions and positions, including duplicated rows for thick shapes (e.g., many 2-row shapes in input lead to paired rows in output).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns [[bg]]; single shape or no main shapes return bordered bg grid; varying shape thicknesses (e.g., 2 rows per shape in output if original was 2-high); colors preserved but not sorted by color—by position.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must be same-color only; visited prevents re-processing; deque for BFS efficiency; after all transforms, re-translate to origin; total_w computed as max offset + shape width; inner grid sized to fit placements exactly before bordering.

(Note: The above are helpful for extraction, normalization, and bordering; the main `program` function below integrates them but has placement bugs—use as base but fix packing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission shown; it correctly handled Training example 1 by extracting, normalizing, and packing shapes into a bordered grid matching the expected layout.
 * For Training example 2, it failed: Generated a 22x16 grid (shorter width, fewer columns) with shapes misplaced and in wrong order/positions—e.g., shape 1 (likely a small L or bar) placed mid-top-left but expected bottom; shape 4 (large block) split across rows incorrectly with 5 and 6 overlapping its space; shape 5 duplicated at bottom but expected mid-right; shape 6 (another block) low but expected mid; overall, rows are paired but packing overflows or shifts left incorrectly, leading to a denser but misaligned layout vs expected's wider 28x20 grid with shapes in position-sorted order (4 top-right, then 5+4 combo mid, 6 bottom-mid, 1 bottom-left with 5 extension).
 * Normalization worked partially (shapes retain topology) but may have over-rotated or mis-flipped some (e.g., shape 4 appears vertically stacked in generated but horizontally in expected).
 * Sorting by min row/col worked for order but placement logic broke: The "place_x = max(0, last_row_end - w +1)" causes unwanted left-shifts/overlaps in new rows, and cap=2*max_h is too narrow for this input's shapes, leading to more rows than expected.
 * Extraction via flood_fill is essential and correct (identifies components >=4 cells accurately).
 * Background ID correct (3 in train2).
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one missed handling wider layouts and row-start alignments (e.g., new rows should start at x=0 always, not shift based on prev end).
 * Function `program` (full integrator) is mostly helpful but broken in placement—fix the packing loop to avoid shifts and use wider cap or dynamic width.
 * No unhelpful functions here; all are relevant, but the packing in `program` is buggy (don't reuse as-is).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's a 36x18 grid (tall and narrow) with shapes 3,5,6,8,9 packed densely in columns, many duplicated rows (e.g., 3-row shapes repeated 3x, suggesting thick vertical stacking), but overlaps and misplacements—e.g., small shape 3 appears multiple times low-right but likely should be isolated; large 8 block spans top but fragmented; 5's extension (row17-19) overlaps 9's space below; 6's wide base at bottom but shifted left unnaturally; overall packing ignores position-sorting (e.g., 9 before 6?), uses bg=4, but layout feels vertical-biased instead of row-packed, missing expected horizontal spread and borders around isolated shapes—likely due to same placement bugs as train2 (narrow cap, shift logic causing cascades), resulting in a cluttered "tower" vs what should be a balanced catalog with shapes in original-order rows; without input grid, can't confirm exact expected, but it doesn't match puzzle intent of clean, sorted rearrangement.

[2025-10-01 03:09:27] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to identify the background color, extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors that meet a minimum size threshold, normalize each shape's orientation and position through translations, rotations, and flips to standardize their appearance (e.g., making them "bottom-left justified" based on weight distribution), and then rearrange these normalized shapes into a new compact grid arranged horizontally in the order they appear in the original grid (sorted by top-left position), with added borders and padding to form a square output grid while preserving the original colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most frequent non-zero color as background; ignore zeros and treat them as empty/transparent, but ensure extraction skips background entirely.
 * Shape extraction: Only consider 4-connected (up/down/left/right) components of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise should be omitted. Sort extracted shapes by their minimum row (topmost position), then by minimum column (leftmost within same row) to preserve reading order (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom in original grid).
 * Normalization subtleties: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. If height > width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise to prefer landscape orientation, then re-translate. For vertical flip: Divide bounding box height in half; if bottom half has equal or more cells than top half, flip vertically (upside-down) and re-translate—this prefers "upright" or balanced shapes but can invert if bottom-heavy. For horizontal flip: In the bottom half, if more cells are on the right than left, flip horizontally (mirror left-right) and re-translate—this prefers left-heavy bottoms. Recalculate bounding box after each transformation. These flips/rotations can subtly change how shapes "face" or align, and equal-weight cases flip vertical (which might not always be desired if the puzzle expects "as-is" for balanced shapes).
 * Arrangement: Place normalized shapes side-by-side horizontally in a row, with 1-cell gaps between them (but no leading gap for the first). Use the max height across all shapes for the row height; widths add up with gaps. This creates a rectangular inner grid.
 * Border and padding: Add a thin border (size 1 in this attempt, but expected seems to use size 2 or variable) of background color around the inner grid. Then pad the entire bordered grid to a square by centering it in a larger grid of side length equal to max(outer_height, outer_width), filling extras with background—this ensures square output but can lead to oversized grids if inner arrangement is too wide/tall.
 * Grid sizing issues: Outputs must match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., train1 expected 12x12, but generated 16x16; train2 expected ~20x28? but generated 32x32). Avoid over-padding or assuming fixed sizes; calculate minimally. Preserve exact cell counts and positions from normalized shapes without overlap or clipping.
 * Color preservation: Keep original colors for shapes; do not change them during normalization or placement.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have uneven shapes, multiple components per color, or shapes touching borders. Zeros are not background but empty—do not treat as shapes. If no shapes, output minimal background grid. Sorting ensures order like reading a book, which might place vertically stacked shapes in input as sequential in output.
 * Potential misses: The >=4 cell threshold works but might filter too aggressively if small shapes are intended. Horizontal arrangement assumes all fit in one row; if too wide, might need multi-row or vertical stacking (not handled here). Border size is inconsistent (attempt uses 1, but expected visuals suggest 2). Flips might over-transform (e.g., equal bottom/top flips vertical, but expected might keep original orientation). Padding centers but can create uneven borders if dimensions differ oddly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it correctly identifies background via frequency and extracts components using flood fill with size filter and sorting by position, which isolates main shapes in order.
 * Normalization functions (translate, bounding box, heaviness checks, flips, rotate) are conceptually helpful for standardizing shapes but produce incorrect orientations/flips in outputs (e.g., shapes appear inverted or mirrored compared to expected, possibly due to flipping on equal weights or unnecessary rotations).
 * Horizontal arrangement with gaps works in theory but fails in practice: shapes are placed but with wrong spacing (no gaps in some expected), leading to oversized inner grids; train1 places only partial/wrong shapes (e.g., only 3's visible, missing 8/1), train2 crams multiple shapes into one area without proper separation.
 * Border addition (size 1) and padding to square are implemented but wrong: uses border=1 (expected visuals suggest 2), and padding over-expands (e.g., train1 to 16x16 vs expected 12x12; train2 to 32x32 vs ~20x28; test to ~50x50 vs likely smaller compact square), centering but creating too much empty space.
 * arrange_shapes_horizontal adds +1 gaps between shapes (including after last?), inflating width unnecessarily—expected has tighter packing without consistent gaps.
 * place_shape is basic and correct for overlaying but clips if out-of-bounds (not an issue here).
 * Overall, extraction and normalization are partially working (shapes are detected), but transformation rules are too aggressive/subtle mismatches (e.g., unknown why train1 only shows 3's, perhaps extraction missed colors or sorting failed); arrangement/bordering/padding bloat the grid size and misplace elements.
 * Function add_border is helpful but needs adjustable size (try 2); pad_to_max_dimension is relevant but over-pads—consider minimal square without centering if not needed.
 * Functions like count_cells_in_half, is_bottom_heavy, flip_vertical, count_bottom_left_right, is_bottom_right_heavy, flip_horizontal are tied to normalization and provide weight-based decisions, but may be overkill or incorrect for puzzle (e.g., expected shapes seem unrotated/unflipped in train1/2).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an enormously oversized ~50x50 grid (way larger than needed) filled almost entirely with background 4's, with shapes (6,9,8,5) crammed into the bottom rows (rows 20-29) in a dense, non-arranged cluster without horizontal spacing, borders, or proper padding/centering—expected should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with shapes arranged horizontally in sorted order, thin borders, and minimal padding, preserving distinct separated positions like in training examples.
 * Shapes appear partially normalized (e.g., 9's in a block, 6's extended, 8/5 adjacent) but not translated/rotated/flipped correctly, and placement ignores order/sorting, leading to overlap or wrong adjacency; no visible borders, and excessive empty space above suggests failed inner grid calculation or padding explosion.
 * This highlights the same issues as training: over-sized output from bad arrangement + padding, incomplete shape extraction/placement (possibly missed some components or colors), and normalization not matching expected orientations (e.g., if test has tall shapes, rotation might have failed silently).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 possibly empty but backgrounds are non-zero), and the goal is to identify distinct connected shapes (blobs of the same color, excluding the background), normalize their positions and orientations to a standard form, and rearrange them into a new larger grid framed by the background color, with shapes placed in a specific spatial layout (e.g., horizontally adjacent or in rows/columns based on original positions) rather than simply stacked.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other colors represent potential shapes, but only connected components (4-connected, via flood fill) of size >=4 cells are considered "main shapes"—smaller blobs are ignored.
 * Shapes must be extracted per color, taking the largest component per color if multiple exist (as in the code's components_by_color logic).
 * Normalization involves translating the shape to (0,0) top-left, then optionally rotating 90 degrees clockwise if height >= width (to prefer wider orientations?), checking for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top half) and flipping vertically if so, then trimming empty space from top/left to re-minimize bounding box— this seems partially correct but may over-rotate or flip in ways that distort shapes relative to expected outputs.
 * Arrangement is key: the code stacks shapes vertically into a square inner canvas (summing heights, max width, padding to square), then adds a 1-cell border, but expected outputs place shapes horizontally adjacent (e.g., in example 1, 8's left, 1's middle-right, 3's bottom-right; in example 2, shapes like 4's and 6's are split across rows/columns), suggesting sorting by original min row position and placing side-by-side or in a grid layout to fit within a bordered frame matching input dimensions or expanded minimally.
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by min row of positions, which is good for vertical order, but expected seems to preserve horizontal relationships or place in original relative positions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs expand the grid (e.g., example 1 input likely 10x10 becomes 12x12 framed), with empty space filled by background; shapes don't overlap and are not rotated/flipped in ways that change their relative "up" direction—code's bottom-heavy flip may be unnecessary or wrongly applied.
 * Handle empty/whitespace: Grids may have irregular shapes; ensure no overwriting during placement.
 * Colors: Preserve original colors; background frames everything.
 * Edge cases: Multiple components per color (take largest); no shapes (return minimal bg grid); varying input sizes.
 * Puzzle rules imply preserving shape integrity—no scaling, just translation/rotation/flip for canonical form, then precise placement to match a "composed" image where shapes are juxtaposed as if "cut out" and reassembled in a new composition.

                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This correctly identifies the most common non-zero as bg, useful for framing and exclusion.)

            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components per color.)

```python
def extract_main_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components_by_color = {}
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                size = len(component)
                if size >= 4:
                    if color not in components_by_color or size > len(components_by_color[color][1]):
                        components_by_color[color] = (color, component)
    shapes = list(components_by_color.values())
    shapes.sort(key=lambda x: min(pr for pr, pc in x[1]))
    return shapes
```
(This is helpful for identifying and sorting largest shapes by min row, but may need adjustment to handle multiple per color or different sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2) and extracts main shapes via flood fill, ignoring small components and bg— this worked for finding the right colors and rough positions.
 * Normalization partially worked: translating to top-left and trimming is good, but rotation (if h >= w) and bottom-heavy flip led to distortions, e.g., in ex1, the 8's L-shape is rotated wrong, placing the long arm vertically instead of horizontally as expected; 3's are flipped or misplaced.
 * Arrangement failed completely: vertical stacking into a square with border created tall, narrow outputs (e.g., ex1 generated is 12x12 but shapes overlap or extend wrongly, with 8's on top spanning full width, 1's below, 3's at bottom—but expected has horizontal placement: 8's left cols 2-5 rows 2-5, 1's cols 8-9 rows 2-3, 3's cols 8-13 rows 7-10, all framed, preserving original orientations and relative horizontal positions).
 * In ex2, generated stacks vertically (1's top, then 5's, 4's wide, 6's bottom), resulting in a 20x20-ish grid with shapes compressed/misplaced (e.g., 4's span rows 9-13 but expected has them horizontal in rows 4-5 cols 10-17; 1's at bottom rows 19-25 but expected at bottom rows 19-25 cols 2-5/10-11? Wait, expected is taller 28x20? with shapes split: 4's and 6's in upper/mid, 1's and 5's lower right/left), showing no preservation of original x-positions or row-based horizontal layout.
 * Sorting by min row is helpful but insufficient—expected seems to place shapes in order of appearance (top-to-bottom) but side-by-side in a wider frame, not stacked.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken: over-applies rotation/flip (e.g., 8's in ex1 become vertical bar + protrusion, but expected is horizontal bar + down protrusion); the bottom-heavy check counts cells but may misclassify due to half rounding; trimming after flip is good but overall distorts.
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is not helpful/wrong: vertical stacking ignores horizontal spacing; inner square padding wastes space and doesn't match expected minimal framed expansion; border=1 is correct but placement offsets wrongly (uses offset_r for vertical but no horizontal offset).
 * Function `rotate_90_cw` and `flip_vertical` are mechanically correct but unhelpful in context as they're applied too aggressively—may not be needed, or need different criteria (e.g., rotate to match original "up" based on min row or centroid).
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is subtle but flawed: uses h//2 which rounds down, and compares raw counts without weighting; in ex1, 3's might flip unnecessarily.
 * Overall, extraction works (right shapes found), but normalization distorts, and arrangement doesn't place horizontally/adjacently as expected—unknown why expected preserves exact bounding boxes without rotation in some cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates a large ~30x41? grid (irregular print but wide) with background 4, stacking shapes vertically in the left side (e.g., two 8-blobs upper rows 1-9 cols 1-10/7-9? looking like duplicated/misextracted 8's, then 3's rows 10-12, 5's rows 13-22 wide, 9's rows 23-29, 6's rows 30-38), with empty right space filled by 4's—no border visible in print, shapes overlap or are padded wrongly (e.g., 5's and 6's have internal 4's misplaced?).
 * It differs from what I'd expect (inferring from trainings): should be a framed grid ~input-sized or slightly expanded, with shapes like 8's (possibly two separate?) placed horizontally adjacent in upper rows, 3's mid-left, 5's/9's/6's in rows/columns preserving original positions (test input not shown, but output suggests vertical stack again, ignoring horizontal layout; e.g., 8's seem split but stacked, 9's wide but alone, no side-by-side like ex1's 8+1 or ex2's 4+5).
 * Missing horizontal placement and possible shape merging/duplication (two 8 groups?); looks like extraction grabbed extras or normalization rotated 5's/6's into tall forms; doesn't make sense as a "puzzle solution" since it's elongated left-heavy, not balanced framed composition—likely same stacking error as trainings.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to identify distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors in an input grid, normalize their positions, orientations, and shapes to a standard form (e.g., top-left aligned, possibly rotated or flipped for consistency), and then rearrange them horizontally side-by-side in a new output grid filled with the background color, ensuring the overall output is a square grid with optional bordering padding while preserving the relative internal structure of each shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the dominant color in the grid (most frequent non-zero value), but it may surround shapes or fill large areas; do not treat zero as background unless specified, and ensure shapes are only extracted if they are connected components of the same color with at least a minimum size (e.g., >=4 cells in the code, but this threshold may be arbitrary or unnecessary).
 * Shapes must be extracted via flood fill on connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right), ignoring background and other colors; small or isolated cells (<4) are skipped, which worked but may over-filter if shapes are small.
 * Normalization is crucial: translate shapes to (0,0) origin (min row/col = 0), determine bounding box height/width, rotate 90 degrees clockwise if height > width to make them landscape-oriented, flip horizontally if the bottom half has more mass on the right than left (to standardize "facing" or asymmetry), and re-normalize origin after transformations; this attempts to canonicalize shapes but fails in examples due to incorrect rotation/flipping logic (e.g., over-rotates or flips asymmetrically, leading to distorted placements).
 * Sorting shapes: Code sorts by minimum row position in original grid (top-to-bottom order of first appearance), which may be correct for reading order but doesn't match expected horizontal left-to-right arrangement in outputs.
 * Placement: Shapes are placed side-by-side horizontally in rows, aligned to the top of the output grid, with their normalized widths added cumulatively; add 1-cell borders top/bottom/left/right around the entire arrangement, then pad to make the output square by adding background rows/columns centered (e.g., if wider than tall, add rows in the middle); total output size should match the minimal square enclosing the bordered arrangement, but code over-pads massively (e.g., +2 borders then squaring leads to oversized grids).
 * Subtleties: Preserve exact relative positions within each shape (no stretching/compression); do not merge shapes or alter colors; output must exactly match expected dimensions and cell values, including background fills; in examples, shapes are abutted directly without gaps between them, but bordered overall; rotations/flips must ensure shapes "face" consistently (e.g., bottom-heavy or asymmetric shapes flipped to standardize); minimum shape size (>=4) skips noise but may miss valid small shapes; background identification counts only non-zero, but if all zero, defaults to 0—ensure it doesn't misidentify shapes as background.
 * Edge cases: Grids with no shapes return single background cell; varying shape sizes require dynamic max height for vertical alignment; if arrangement is taller than wide post-border, pad columns centered; test input has multiple shapes (colors 8,3,5,9,6?) that need sequential horizontal placement without distortion.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid re-processing; use deque for BFS efficiency; counter for background via frequency; handle empty grids; sorting by y-position assumes vertical scanning order, but examples suggest left-to-right or appearance order; final squaring pads symmetrically but code's half = extra//2 may off-center if odd; generated outputs show shapes concatenated horizontally but with wrong normalization (e.g., 8's block is too wide/tall, 1's misplaced), leading to non-matching dimensions (14x14 vs expected 12x12 for train1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                counts[cell] += 1
    return max(counts, key=counts.get) if counts else 0
```
(This works well for finding the most frequent non-background color as bg, but may need adjustment if bg is zero or sparse.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:

                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of the same color, avoiding background and other shapes; use it in future attempts.)

def get_h_w(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in positions)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```
(This correctly computes bounding box height/width from positions; helpful for normalization and placement sizing.)

```python
def normalize_shape(color: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (The full function from the code is partially helpful for origin translation and basic rotation/flip, but broken in rotation logic—if h > w, it rotates but then swaps h/w incorrectly, and flip condition based on bottom-half mass is heuristic but misapplies, leading to distorted shapes; salvage the translation parts but rewrite rotation/flip.)
```
(Partially helpful for translation to (0,0) and bounding box calc, but the rotation (if h>w, rotate to landscape then flip vertically?) and flip (bottom-right > bottom-left mass) are flawed and cause mismatches; do not reuse as-is, but adapt the min_r/min_c normalization.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 2 for train1, 3 for train2) and extracts components via flood fill, skipping small ones (>=4 cells), which worked for finding main shapes but may be too strict.
 * Normalization attempts to standardize orientation (rotate if tall, flip if asymmetric) but fails: for train1, the 8-shape is rotated/flipped into a 4x4 block instead of expected 4-high x 4-wide with cutout; 1-shape becomes 2x2 but misplaced; 3-shape distorted to 2-high x 6-wide but wrong alignment.
 * Placement sorts shapes by min row (vertical order), then concatenates horizontally with no gaps, adds borders, and pads to square—but over-pads (e.g., train1 becomes 14x14 instead of 12x12, with shapes centered wrongly in rows 6-9 instead of rows 3-10 top-aligned); for train2, shapes are crammed into rows 12-16 with huge background overhead (28x28 vs expected ~20x20), and order wrong (1's,5's,4's,6's misplaced relative to expected vertical-ish but horizontal arrangement).
 * Train1 generated: Shapes horizontally concatenated but normalized wrongly (8's too blocky/wide, 1's shifted right, 3's bottom-heavy flip failed), dimensions oversized with borders, shapes in middle rows 6-9 with top/bottom all-bg rows; expected: 12x12, shapes top-aligned in rows 3-10, 8's left (4w), then 1's (2w), then 3's (6w max), with precise cutouts (e.g., 8's have 2-wide bottom).
 * Train2 generated: All-bg top 11 rows, shapes in 12-16 (1's left, then 5's/4's/6's distorted/wrong widths), bottom all-bg; expected: More compact ~20x20, shapes in scattered rows (e.g., 4's mid-right rows 3-8, 6's lower rows 11-16, 1's bottom rows 19-26, 5's integrated), horizontal but with vertical spacing preserved? Wait, expected seems to rearrange in appearance order horizontally per "section" but code linearizes wrongly.
 * Function `normalize_shape` is broken (rotation swaps h/w but positions list incorrectly, flip miscalculates mass leading to upside-down or mirrored shapes); do not use as-is.
 * Overall, component extraction essential and works, but sorting/placement/padding logic misses top-alignment, exact widths, and minimal sizing; unknown why train2 expected has shapes not strictly horizontal (e.g., 1's at bottom, 5's overlapping sections)—may need order by first appearance x-then-y, not just y.
 * Test output generated: A massive ~32x48 grid (way oversized from over-padding/squaring), mostly all 4's (bg), with shapes only in rows 18-20 (8's left long block, then 3's/5's/9's/6's concatenated but distorted: 8's 3-high x10-wide instead of structured, 9's 3-high x9-wide blocky, 6's trailing); this does not look correct—expected should be compact square (maybe 20x20+), shapes normalized and top-aligned horizontally in order of appearance (likely 8,3,5,9,6 from positions), preserving cutouts (e.g., 8's probably L or irregular, not solid; 9's stepped, 6's bar-like), with 1-cell borders and centered padding if needed, not this huge empty expanse; differences: wrong dims/shape integrity/placement, shapes merged/distorted without gaps but wrong orientations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it is an oversized rectangular-then-squared grid (~32 rows x 48 cols, padded to square?) with excessive background, shapes only in a narrow band (rows 18-20), and visible distortions (e.g., 8's as solid 10-wide bar instead of expected irregular form with holes/cutouts, 9's blocky without steps, overall not top-aligned or compact).
 * The test output is missing proper normalization (no rotation/flip to standard, leading to raw concatenated widths totaling ~40+), exact shape preservation (flood fill captures but transforms break structure), and minimal sizing (should be ~22x22 bordered square based on max h~8-10, total w~30-40, pad to square).
 * Make sure to account for multiple asymmetric shapes (e.g., 3's small, 5's/6's medium, 9's large stepped, 8's complex) by improving flip/rotate heuristics and sorting by scan order (row-major left-to-right-top-to-bottom) to handle test case; unknown why generated is so vertically centered with huge top/bottom bg, but likely from code's +2 borders then aggressive squaring without trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting connected components (blobs) of the same non-background color from an input grid, filtering out small ones (less than 4 cells), normalizing their positions to a local origin, optionally rotating them to prefer landscape orientation, sorting them by their original top-left positions, and then reassembling them into a new compact grid with a background border and padding to a square shape. The goal is to create a "catalog" or standardized rendering of the extracted shapes while preserving their identities and relative ordering, but the current approach fails in arrangement, leading to mismatched layouts compared to expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color (or 0 if none); all other colors are treated as foreground for components.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and same-color; only extract those with >=4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalize each component by translating positions relative to its min_r and min_c, compute its bounding box height (h) and width (w).
 * Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if h > w (tall shapes) to make them wider, updating positions as (c, h-1-r); this prefers horizontal/landscape shapes but may alter visual orientation subtly.
 * Sort extracted shapes by original (min_r, min_c) to process in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, mimicking reading order.
 * Arrangement is critical: current horizontal side-by-side placement creates a thin strip, but expected outputs suggest a more grid-like or vertically stacked layout that preserves relative vertical positioning (e.g., top shapes above bottom ones, with horizontal alignment within rows).
 * Add a 1-cell border of background around the inner arrangement, then pad the entire grid to the nearest square (max dimension) with background, centering the content.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs have consistent sizing (e.g., 12x12 for training 1, 20x20 for training 2), implying the inner arrangement's max_h and total_w determine the final side length after border (+2) and padding.
 * Easy to miss: Shapes may overlap or align in the new grid based on original relative positions, but current code ignores vertical offsets and packs everything into one row; also, rotation may misalign shapes if the puzzle expects no rotation or different rotation logic.
 * Handle empty grids or no valid components by returning a single background cell.
 * Outputs use lists of lists, with rows as lists of ints; ensure deep copies to avoid mutation.
 * Potential edge: Shapes with irregular bounding boxes (e.g., L-shapes) must fill their relative positions correctly without gaps in the new grid.

        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                visited[nr][nc] = True

                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This performs standard 4-connected flood fill for same-color components; essential for extracting blobs accurately.)

```python
def extract_raw_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != bg:
                color = g[r][c]
                comp = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if len(comp) >= 4:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in comp)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in comp)
                    components.append((min_r, min_c, color, comp))
    return components
```
(This extracts and filters components >=4 cells, with min_r/min_c for sorting; core to identifying valid shapes, but note it skips background cells correctly.)

```python
def translate_to_origin(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if not positions:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    relative = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in positions]
    h = max(r for r, _ in relative) + 1
    w = max(c for _, c in relative) + 1
    return relative, h, w
```
(This normalizes shape positions to (0,0) origin and computes tight bounding box; helpful for isolating shapes.)

```python
def rotate_if_tall(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    if h <= w:
        return positions, h, w
    new_positions = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in positions]
    new_h = w
    new_w = h
    return new_positions, new_h, new_w
```
(This rotates tall shapes to landscape; useful but may be a subtlety—puzzle might not require rotation, or it could be causing mismatches in shape orientation.)

```python
def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    new_h = gh + 2
    new_w = gw + 2
    new_grid = [[bg] * new_w for _ in range(new_h)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This adds a 1-cell background border; correct and necessary for framing.)

```python
def pad_to_square(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0]) if gh > 0 else 0
    side = max(gh, gw)
    if gh == 0 or gw == 0:
        return [[bg]]
    if side == gh == gw:
        return [row[:] for row in grid]  # copy
    new_grid = [[bg] * side for _ in range(side)]
    offset_r = (side - gh) // 2
    offset_c = (side - gw) // 2
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[offset_r + i][offset_c + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This centers and pads to square with background; works well but amplifies issues if inner grid is imbalanced.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters components (>=4 cells), normalizes positions, and applies optional rotation, but fails in sorting and arrangement: shapes are sorted by (min_r, min_c) but placed horizontally side-by-side in a single row, creating a thin inner grid (e.g., height ~2-4, wide total_w), leading to many empty rows after bordering and square-padding.
 * For training example 1: Generated a 14x14 grid with all shapes crammed into rows 5-8 (8's left, 1's middle, 3's right, but misaligned and no vertical separation), surrounded by 2's border and top/bottom padding; expected is 12x12 with 8's top-left (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1's top-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9), 3's bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 8-13, horizontal), preserving vertical ordering and compactness—generated mismatches by flattening to one row and oversized padding.
 * For training example 2: Generated a 28x28 grid (way oversized) with 10+ empty rows top/bottom, shapes crammed into rows 11-16 (1's left, 5's scattered, 4's/6's middle-right, but jumbled and no grid structure); expected is 20x20 with shapes in a multi-row layout (4's/5's top-middle rows 2-7, 6's middle rows 10-15, 1's bottom rows 18-25, with vertical stacking and horizontal alignment within "rows" of shapes)—generated differs by horizontal packing, wrong size, and poor alignment (e.g., 1's and 5's fragmented).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) works for order but doesn't account for vertical grouping; build_inner_grid is broken for multi-row arrangements—needs to place shapes in rows based on original min_r buckets or similar.
 * Rotation may be unhelpful or incorrect: e.g., in training 1, 3's is horizontal in expected but might be rotated if tall; don't use if it distorts expected shapes.
 * Flood_fill and extract_raw_components are essential and correct for component detection; translate_to_origin is helpful for normalization.
 * add_border and pad_to_square are correct but highlight arrangement flaws (e.g., thin inner -> empty square).
 * Overall, extraction works (shapes identified correctly), but rearrangement doesn't mimic the expected "poster" or "inventory" layout with vertical stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it's a massive ~48x48? grid (inferred from 48 elements per row) mostly filled with background 4's (empty rows 0-16 and 20-47), with shapes crammed into only rows 17-19 (8's left spanning multiple rows but flattened, 3's/5's/9's/6's jumbled horizontally without vertical separation or alignment, e.g., 8's block rows 17-19 cols 1-9, then scattered smaller blobs like 3's at cols 10-12, 5's at 13-21, etc., ending with 6's right).
 * It differs from what we'd expect (based on training): should be a compact square (likely 20-30 side) with extracted shapes (8,3,5,9,6 colors visible) arranged in a multi-row grid layout (e.g., larger 8's block top, smaller ones below/right, bordered by 4's, centered), preserving relative original positions vertically; instead, horizontal cramming creates imbalance, no stacking (all in 3 rows), and excessive empty space, suggesting the same arrangement bug as training examples.
 * Shapes seem extracted correctly (e.g., large 8's, 9's block, 6's), but placement ignores vertical offsets—e.g., if test has vertically separated shapes, they should stack, not inline; rotation might have flipped some (unknown if needed).
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too sparse/empty, mismatched size, no visual "catalog" structure; likely fails if test expects similar to training 2's stacked layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains a background color and multiple connected components (shapes) of different colors, and the goal is to extract the "main" shapes (likely those with sufficient size, e.g., >=4 cells), normalize their position and orientation in a canonical way (translating to top-left, possibly rotating/flipping for consistency), and then reassemble them into a new output grid with the same background, arranged in a structured layout (e.g., sorted by original position or color, possibly stacked vertically with borders or spacing to match the expected compositions).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Extract only "main" shapes: Connected components of the same color, excluding the background (identified as the most frequent non-zero color), and filter to those with at least 4 cells to ignore noise or small artifacts.
 * Normalization is crucial but tricky: Translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; ensure consistent orientation by rotating clockwise if height > width (to prefer landscape), always flipping vertically (to prefer "upright" or top-heavy?), and conditionally flipping horizontally if the shape is "bottom-right heavy" (more cells in bottom-right quadrant than bottom-left, to prefer left-leaning or balanced asymmetry).
 * Arrangement rules: Shapes should be placed in the output in the order they appear when scanned top-to-bottom, left-to-right (based on the minimum row/col of the component), but stacked vertically rather than horizontally; include spacing or gaps (e.g., 1-2 cells of background) between shapes, and add a uniform border (thickness 2) around the entire composition; the inner grid height should accommodate the tallest shape, but the overall layout expands vertically for multiple shapes.
 * Background handling: Correctly identify as the most common non-zero color (e.g., 2 in ex1, 3 in ex2, 4 in test); fill all non-shape areas with it; do not treat 0 as background if non-zero colors dominate.
 * Sorting and placement subtleties: After extraction, sort components by their original top-left position (min row, then min col); place each normalized shape at increasing y-positions (vertical stacking) with x-offsets to align left or center; ensure bounding boxes don't overlap and gaps prevent merging; in ex1, the 8-shape is placed highest, 1-shape mid-right, 3-shape lowest-right, suggesting vertical progression with horizontal offsets based on original relative positions.
 * Size and padding: Output should match expected dimensions exactly (e.g., ex1: 12 rows x 12 cols inner? but with border; ex2 taller with more vertical space); add border after inner composition; if no shapes, return a single bg cell.
 * Easy-to-miss elements: Shapes may have irregular forms (e.g., L-shapes or protrusions in ex1's 8 and 3); normalization flips/rotations must preserve connectivity and color but can alter visual "up" direction—over-flipping leads to mismatches (e.g., 3-shape in ex1 appears "upside-down" or mirrored in generated); original positions influence order/placement (not just color); small shapes (<4 cells) are ignored, but in ex2, some 1's and 5's seem split or partial.
 * General: Grids are rectangular; use 4-directional connectivity for flood-fill; handle empty/zero grids gracefully.

```
(This correctly identifies bg as most frequent non-zero color; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python

                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(Flood-fill for connected components; essential and works correctly for extracting same-color blobs.)

```python

    components.sort(key=lambda x: (min(rr for rr, _ in x[1]), min(cc for _, cc in x[1])))
    return components
```
(Extracts and sorts main shapes by original top-left position; very helpful, correctly filters small components and orders by scan order.)

    if not positions:
        return []

    min_r = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    min_c = min(c for _, c in positions)
    max_c = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return max_r - min_r + 1, max_c - min_c + 1
```
(Translation and bounding box utilities; core to normalization, work well but need integration with correct rotation/flip logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, extracts and filters main shapes (>=4 cells), sorts them by original position, and normalizes via translation/rotation/flip, but arranges them horizontally side-by-side with fixed gaps (1 cell), leading to wide, short grids instead of vertical stacking.
 * Train 1 generated a compact 8x18 grid (after border?) with 8-shape left, 1-shape mid, 3-shape right, all at similar heights (rows 2-5), but expected is 12x12 with vertical separation: 8-shape top (rows 2-5, cols 2-5), 1-shape mid-right (rows 2-3, cols 8-9 but lower effective), empty space below 8, then 3-shape bottom-right (rows 6-9, cols 4-9 and 8-11); difference: horizontal vs. vertical layout, no vertical spacing, and possible flip mismatch on 3-shape (appears shifted right in generated).
 * Train 2 generated a messy 10x34 horizontal jumble with shapes overlapping or poorly spaced (e.g., 1's and 5's mixed left, 4's and 6's mid-right, extra 5's/6's duplicated?), but expected is ~18x20 with vertical sections: upper 4's/5's stacked, mid 6's horizontal, lower 1's vertical with 5's right; differences: extreme width from horizontal placement, incorrect sorting/placement (e.g., 1's appear low but should be bottom, 5's duplicated or mispositioned), and border adds uneven padding; unknown why some shapes like 5's are split or extra in generated.
 * Normalization flips (always vertical, conditional horizontal) may over-correct, causing shape orientations to mismatch expected (e.g., 3 in ex1 looks "flipped" horizontally in generated vs. expected left-aligned); rotation only if h>w works but doesn't handle all asymmetries.
 * Arrangement uses max height for inner grid but places all at y=0 with x-offsets, ignoring vertical progression; should instead accumulate height with per-shape y-offsets based on order.
 * add_border is helpful and correct (thickness=2, pads uniformly), but applied to wrong inner layout.
 * is_bottom_right_heavy and flip functions are somewhat helpful for asymmetry but may be too aggressive—consider optional or rule-based (e.g., only if > certain imbalance threshold).
 * Overall, extraction/sorting is strong (shapes identified correctly), but layout is the core failure; no unhelpful functions, but the full program() integrates poorly (e.g., current_x accumulation assumes horizontal).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's an extremely wide ~13x51 grid (after border) with all shapes (8,3,5,9,6, etc.) crammed horizontally in a single band (mostly rows 2-11), with some vertical extent for taller shapes like 8/9/6 but no true stacking—e.g., 8-shape left tall, then 3/5/9/6 clustered mid-right, all at similar heights with minimal gaps, leading to a linear "strip" composition.
 * It mismatches expected logic from trainings, which use vertical stacking with offsets (e.g., shapes at increasing y-positions, horizontal shifts for alignment); here, everything is side-by-side, causing overlaps or squeezes (e.g., 9-shape protrudes but not separated vertically from 6); border is added correctly, but inner layout is wrong—test likely needs taller grid with shapes like 8 top, 3/5 mid, 9/6 bottom, sorted by original positions, preserving relative x-offsets from input.
 * Does not make sense: Too horizontal and compact, ignores vertical order from extraction sort; possible normalization issues (e.g., 8-shape rotated wrong, appearing stretched); extra bg fills but no spacing between sections.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from a grid, normalizing their orientation and position to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips based on heuristics like bottom-heaviness or right-heaviness), sorting them by original position, and then rearranging them into a new bordered grid with the background color, likely in a packed row-based layout to simulate a "catalog" or standardized display of the shapes while preserving their normalized forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all empty spaces in the output use this.
 * Extract only connected components (4-connected, same color) with at least 4 cells; ignore smaller blobs or single cells.
 * Components must be flood-filled correctly to capture full shapes, even irregular ones like L-shapes or those with protrusions.
 * Normalization is critical: translate all shapes to (0,0) origin; if height > width, rotate 90° clockwise; check for "bottom-heavy" (more cells in bottom half than top) and flip vertically if so (especially after rotation); check for "bottom-right heavy" (in bottom half, more cells on right than left) and flip horizontally if so; re-translate after each transform to keep origin at (0,0).
 * Sorting: Components are sorted by their original minimum row and column (top-left position in source grid), which determines arrangement order.
 * Arrangement: Pack shapes into rows on a new canvas; use a capacity limit (e.g., max_width + max_height of shapes) to decide when to start a new row; add horizontal gaps (e.g., 2 units) between shapes in a row, vertical gaps (e.g., 0) between rows; align shapes left-to-right in rows, top-to-bottom for rows; compute total canvas size based on max row dimensions.
 * Border: Add a uniform border (thickness 2) of background color around the arranged inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations/flips must update bounding box dimensions correctly after each step; "heaviness" checks only apply if height/width >1; arrangement may need to align shapes to a baseline (e.g., bottom-aligned in rows?) or handle varying heights without vertical centering; original positions influence order but not final placement beyond sorting; ensure no overlaps or out-of-bounds writes; the expected outputs show shapes in "canonical" orientations that look standardized (e.g., L-shapes opening rightward or downward), suggesting normalization is key but may need additional rules like preferring certain rotations.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must respect grid bounds and only same-color cells; normalization can chain (e.g., rotate then flip, re-check heaviness); packing may fail if capacity is miscalculated (e.g., too small, causing unnecessary row breaks); shapes like partial rectangles or hooks (e.g., the 3's L-shape) get flipped to a consistent form, but if flips are wrong, they appear mirrored or rotated incorrectly in output; border thickness is fixed at 2, and canvas must be exactly sized to fit with border.
 * Across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it handles extraction and normalization partially; issues in packing lead to misaligned rows (e.g., shapes starting at wrong x-offsets); test case has multiple rows of shapes (8,5,9,6 with small 3's), suggesting need for multi-row packing without excessive gaps.

(These handle translation, bounding box, and basic transforms; core to normalization and work correctly individually, but chaining in normalize_shape needs fixes for re-translation and re-bounding after each step.)

        positions = translate_to_origin(positions)
        h, w = get_bounding_box(positions)
    return color, positions
```
(This attempts full normalization but is buggy: is_bottom_heavy and is_bottom_right_heavy definitions may be incorrect—bottom_heavy counts top vs bottom but doesn't specify "heavy" threshold clearly; bottom_right_heavy only checks bottom half and compares left/right counts strictly (>); vertical flip condition ties to rotation oddly; doesn't handle multiple rotations or full 360° normalization; re-bounding after flips is good but heaviness checks may need to be recursive or more robust for irregular shapes.)

def add_border(grid: List[List[int]], thickness: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return [[bg]]
    gh = len(grid)
    gw = len(grid[0])
    nh = gh + 2 * thickness
    nw = gw + 2 * thickness
    new_grid = [[bg for _ in range(nw)] for _ in range(nh)]
    for i in range(gh):
        for j in range(gw):
            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This correctly adds a fixed-thickness border; helpful and accurate.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided, but it successfully extracts components (e.g., identifies 8,1,3 in train1 and various in train2/test), normalizes positions to origin, and adds border correctly.
 * What worked: Background detection, flood-fill extraction (captures full shapes >=4 cells), translation to origin, basic rotation/flip mechanics, sorting by original min_r/min_c, and border addition; the inner grid filling avoids overlaps.
 * What didn't work: Normalization heuristics are incomplete—e.g., in train1, the 3-shape (likely an L or hook) isn't flipped/rotated to match expected (generated places it as a left-aligned partial rectangle in row 6-9 cols 6-9, but expected has it right-shifted in row 6-7 cols 8-9 and full in row 8-9 cols 4-9, suggesting wrong canonical orientation); in train2, multiple shapes (1,5,4,6) are packed incorrectly (generated spreads them across rows with wrong alignments, e.g., 1's left then 5's right, but expected groups 4's large in middle-right, 5's small left, 6's bottom, 1's bottom-left with extensions).
 * Arrangement/packing is the main failure: Uses capacity = max_w + max_h (e.g., ~8 for squares), gap_h=2, but breaks rows too early or left-aligns without matching expected offsets (e.g., train1 generated puts 3's at col 6, expected at col 4-9 with gap; train2 generated has vertical stacking issues, e.g., 4's split across rows wrongly); no vertical alignment within rows (shapes may need bottom-alignment); total canvas sizing pads correctly but positions don't match.
 * Sorting works (order seems 8 then 1 then 3 in train1, matching original positions), but downstream packing ignores subtle spacing (e.g., expected has larger gaps or fixed columns).
 * Function `arrange_shapes` is broken/not helpful: Capacity logic causes poor packing (e.g., fits 8+1 in row1 but 3 alone in row2 left-aligned; train2 overflows rows wrongly); gaps are asymmetric (h=2, v=0); doesn't compute max row width correctly for centering or right-alignment; suggest replacing with fixed-grid or better knapsack-style packing.
 * Function `is_bottom_heavy` is partially helpful but flawed: Simple half-split count works for symmetric cases but fails for irregulars (e.g., L-shapes may not trigger flip correctly; threshold is >= but may need > or weighted center-of-mass).
 * Function `is_bottom_right_heavy` similar issue: Only bottom-half check is good, but strict > count may miss balanced-but-skewed shapes; applied too late in chain.
 * Overall, extraction/normalization gets ~70% right (shapes identifiable), but transform logic and packing need overhaul for orientations and layout to match expected standardized arrangements.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it rearranges shapes (large 8/9/5/6 blocks, small 3's) into a multi-row packed grid with border 4, but the layout is misaligned similar to trainings—e.g., 8's top-left spanning rows 2-10 cols 2-11, small 3's awkwardly next to it in rows 2-4 cols 12-15, then 5's below in rows 11-20 with internal structure (suggesting partial normalization of a complex shape), 9's mid-right rows 20-28, 6's bottom rows 29-38; this seems like linear left-to-right packing with row breaks, but expected likely needs better canonical orientations (e.g., all "bottom-left" aligned L's or hooks) and tighter/spaced rows matching original relative positions or a grid-like catalog (e.g., sorted into 2-3 per row with even spacing); small 3's are repeated/clustered oddly, possibly from extraction error or no deduping; overall, it "makes sense" as an attempt at rearrangement but fails subtlety like train cases (wrong flips cause 5/9/6 to appear stretched vertically/horizontally; packing capacity too loose, leading to tall thin canvas instead of compact); to handle test, need to refine heaviness to prefer "opening right/down" for hooks, increase gap_h to 3-4 for alignment, and ensure post-transform bounding boxes trigger correct row heights.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that involves extracting distinct connected components (shapes) of the same color from an input grid, ignoring small ones (under 4 cells), normalizing each shape's orientation through translations, rotations, and flips to a canonical form (e.g., minimizing height relative to width and balancing cell distribution), sorting them (likely by original top-left position), and rearranging them into a new bordered grid with row-based packing where rows are filled left-to-right without exceeding a width limit based on the tallest shape, but the current implementation's sorting, normalization balancing, and row alignment logic produce incorrect layouts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are connected components of the same non-background color; background is likely the dominant surrounding color (not necessarily the most common non-zero as currently implemented, which can misidentify it if a shape is larger than the background).
 * Ignore components smaller than 4 cells to filter out noise or minor elements.
 * Normalization must produce a unique canonical representation: translate to (0,0) origin, rotate 90° CW repeatedly until height <= width, then optionally flip vertically if the bottom half has more or equal cells than the top, and flip horizontally if the post-flip bottom-right quadrant has more cells than bottom-left; this ensures consistent orientation but can fail if the balancing logic doesn't match the expected "heavier" side correctly (e.g., subtle cell counts in halves/quadrants can lead to wrong flips).
 * Sorting of shapes should be by their original minimum row then minimum column (top-left priority) to preserve input order, but current implementation sorts components this way before normalization, which is good, but downstream placement ignores it.
 * Layout: Use a maximum row width of 2 * global max height for packing; fill rows greedily left-to-right with gaps (e.g., 2 units); for multi-row outputs, align subsequent rows to the right edge of the previous row's content (via prev_end - row_span +1), but this creates incorrect staggering/overlap in examples; add a 2-unit border around the entire inner grid.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must exactly match expected dimensions and positions, including empty background fills; shapes must not overlap or clip; vertical gaps between rows should be 0 or minimal; in examples, shapes like the 3's in train1 appear in specific orientations (e.g., wide horizontal at bottom, narrow vertical at side) suggesting the normalization sometimes needs to prefer certain rotations/flips over others, or perhaps sort by color after position.
 * Background identification: Current counter ignores 0 and picks most common non-zero, but in examples (bg=2 or 3), it works coincidentally but could fail if background is 0 or less common; extraction skips background and 0.
 * Potential misses: Original shapes may have irregular bounding boxes, so post-normalization bounding boxes must be recomputed accurately; flips/rotations change coordinates, requiring re-translation; large grids (like test) need efficient packing without unnecessary empty space.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes, multiple shapes per color (but examples treat same-color connected as one), and ensure the final grid includes full borders even if inner is empty.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it correctly extracts shapes via flood-fill and filters small ones, normalizes orientations (rotation and flips), and adds borders, but fails on layout packing and alignment.
 * Train1: Generated correctly places 8's and 1's in top rows but swaps the 3's—wide horizontal 3's (6-wide) appear in rows 6-7 middle instead of rows 8-9 middle, and narrow vertical 3's (2-wide) in rows 8-9 right instead of rows 6-7 right; this suggests wrong row assignment and possible normalization flip/rotation mismatch for 3's (unknown why, perhaps vertical flip threshold is too loose).
 * Train2: Generated has severely disrupted layout—e.g., 1's and 5's are placed top-middle and scattered, 4's horizontal in middle but shifted left, 6's bottom but with extra rows and misalignments (e.g., 1's span rows 2-5 and 18-25 incorrectly); expected has more compact vertical stacking with 4's/6's centered, 1's/5's side-placed, indicating packing greedily overflows rows and the right-alignment for subsequent rows (prev_end calc) causes staggering/overlap.
 * Sorting by original position works for extraction but is ignored in placement, leading to arbitrary row filling.
 * Normalization balancing (e.g., v_flipped if bottom >= top) produces wrong orientations for asymmetric shapes like the 3's, causing expected vs. generated shape forms to differ (e.g., one vertical, one horizontal).
 * Row packing logic breaks on multi-shape rows: max_row_w = 2*max_h is reasonable but gap=2 and left-to-right greedy fill doesn't center or justify rows correctly; vert_gap=0 is good but current_y += mh + vert_gap skips properly, yet prev_end adjustment for row_start_x misaligns non-first rows to the left instead of right/center.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the full program() integrates them poorly; extract_all_main_shapes and flood_fill are essential and correct, while normalize_shape needs refinement for flip conditions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it produces a large 32x22 grid (after border?) with shapes like 8's (11-wide horizontal top), 3's (3-wide vertical side), 5's (scattered horizontal/vertical middle), 9's (11-wide horizontal bottom), 6's (9-wide horizontal very bottom), but placements show irregularities: e.g., 3's repeat in cols 13-15 across multiple row groups without connection, 5's have a wide 9-cell row 14-16 but narrow above/below suggesting poor packing, and overall staggering (e.g., row starts shift leftward) creates empty spaces and non-compact layout unlike the tighter, vertically stacked expected patterns in trains.
 * Compared to trains, it exacerbates alignment issues: shapes aren't right-justified or centered per row (e.g., 8's and 9's span cols 2-12 but 5's/6's start at col 7, leaving uneven gaps); no expected provided, but mentally simulating rules (extract/normalize/sort by pos/pack rows max 2*max_h~22 wide, border), it should be more uniform without the vertical repetition of side 3's or mid-grid 5's overflow—likely wrong due to same row_start_x bug causing left-drift and normalization failing on complex shapes like 5's/6's (e.g., if they have uneven quadrants, flips misorient).
 * Test highlights scalability issue: with more/larger shapes (colors 3,5,6,8,9), greedy packing creates too many short rows and misaligns, missing subtle rule that rows should be centered or fully left-aligned without prev_end adjustment.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to extract distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from an input grid, normalize each shape's position and orientation to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips), and then rearrange them into a new grid layout with rows of shapes, gaps between them, centered alignment per row, and a bordered background. The output preserves the original colors and connected structure but standardizes the composition for consistency across inputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification: Use the most common non-zero color as background (bg); ignore all bg cells during extraction, but do not extract components of the bg color itself even if connected.
 * Shape extraction: Only extract 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same color with size >=4 cells; smaller blobs or single cells are ignored as noise. Sort extracted components by their top-left position (min row, then min col) before processing.
 * Normalization process: Translate all positions to origin (0,0); compute bounding box (h=height, w=width); rotate 90° CW repeatedly until h <= w (track rotations for later flips); for vertical flip decision, count cells in top vs. bottom half—if rotations even and bottom heavier, or rotations odd and top heavier, flip vertically; after vertical flip (if any), check bottom half's left vs. right mass—if right heavier, flip horizontally. This ensures a "standard" orientation minimizing asymmetry.
 * Layout arrangement: After normalization, sort shapes implicitly by extraction order (which is position-based); place into rows where each row's max width is max(h+w across shapes) + gaps; start new row if adding next shape exceeds row width; add gap=2 between shapes in row; center each row by shifting left-aligned content; stack rows vertically with no vertical gaps; final inner grid size based on max row width and total height; add thickness=2 border of bg around the entire inner grid.
 * Subtleties: Rotations affect flip logic (even/odd parity changes vertical mass interpretation); bounding box updates after each transform; components must be exactly same-color connected (flood-fill stops at color mismatch); output grid must match exact dimensions and positions—no extra bg inside shapes or overlaps; preserve original colors (do not remap); if no valid shapes, output single bg cell; extraction skips visited cells to avoid reprocessing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with all bg or tiny shapes return minimal bg grid; shapes touching border or each other are still separate if different colors; normalization can change effective h/w; horizontal flip only after vertical to avoid over-correction; sorting by min position ensures consistent order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

 * Training example 2 failed: Generated output has incorrect shape ordering/placement (e.g., shape 1 appears in top-middle but expected at bottom; shape 5 misplaced to right of 1 instead of left; shape 4's wide bar is split and lower than expected; shape 6's L-shape is rotated/flipped wrong, appearing as a vertical stack instead of horizontal with extension). Dimensions mismatch (generated 20x16 inner? vs expected 20x20 with more even spacing); rows not centered properly (e.g., expected has centered 4-bar spanning most width, but generated has it offset); vertical stacking has extra empty rows or misaligned heights.
 * Normalization likely over-rotates or misapplies flips in training 2 (e.g., shape 4's horizontal bar becomes vertical in generated; shape 1's partial square not flipped to match expected orientation); extraction sorts correctly but layout row-breaking fails when shapes have varying h/w post-normalization.
 * Layout uses max_row_w = max_h + max_w, but this assumes single-shape rows—fails when multiple small shapes fit but code breaks rows prematurely; gap=2 is applied but centering shift = total_w - row_used_w doesn't account for gaps in used_w calc.
 * extract_all_main_shapes is helpful and correct (properly filters >=4, sorts); flood_fill is solid (no leaks across colors).
 * The full program() integrates everything but has bugs in row packing (current_x += sw + gap overflows incorrectly) and inner_grid filling (abs_x = shift + local_x ignores gaps in placement, causing overlaps or shifts).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though normalize_shape's flip conditions may need tuning for asymmetric shapes like L's or partial bars.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It extracts 5+ shapes (colors 3,5,6,8,9) with bg=4, but arrangement is a tall vertical stack (32x18?) with shapes in columns rather than rows—e.g., multiple horizontal bars (8,9) stacked directly, small protrusions like 3's on right of some bars suggest poor normalization (possibly unflipped or unrotated, as 3's look like detached arms); shape 5's complex form (looks like a plus or cross with extensions) spans unevenly, indicating failed bounding/translate after flips; no visible gaps between shapes in "rows," and centering absent (left-heavy alignment); border thickness=2 is applied but inner content overflows or misaligns (e.g., 5's bottom extensions hit border unevenly).
 * Compared to expected (inferred from pattern/rules): Should have shapes normalized (e.g., all bars horizontal with h<=w, L-shapes standardized to bottom-left heavy), sorted by original top-left, packed into 2-3 rows with gap=2 and centering (wider rows like 8/9 bars spanning full width), total inner ~20-24 high x max_row_w wide, no vertical stacking without row breaks—current output mashes everything vertically, missing the row-based horizontal composition.
 * Test highlights normalization issues for tall/thin shapes (e.g., 5 and 6 seem rotated wrong, as their extensions are vertical instead of balanced); layout bug amplified here with more shapes, causing no row breaks (current_x never exceeds due to small sw post-norm?); extraction seems to catch all >=4 (good), but order wrong (e.g., 8 before 3, but 3's small position should sort earlier).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of distinct colored shapes (connected components of non-background cells) from an input grid, normalization of those shapes for canonical orientation and position, and rearrangement into a new output grid that packs the shapes into centered rows with gaps, surrounded by a thick background border. The output preserves the original colors of the shapes while using the input's dominant color as the background, aiming to create a standardized "catalog" or layout of the shapes sorted by their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; all other cells are treated as shape pixels unless they match this background.
 * Only extract "main" shapes: connected components (4-directional flood fill) of the same color with at least 4 cells; smaller blobs or noise are ignored.
 * Shapes must be normalized: translate to (0,0) origin, optionally rotate 90 degrees clockwise once if height != width (to attempt squaring), flip vertically based on top/bottom pixel counts for "upright" orientation, and flip horizontally if the bottom-right quadrant has more pixels than bottom-left (for left-leaning bias).
 * Sorting: Components are sorted by the minimum row of their pixels, then by minimum column, to process in top-to-left order.
 * Packing: Shapes are placed into rows where the total width (including gaps of 2 between shapes) fits a capacity of 2 * max_shape_height; rows are centered horizontally in the final inner grid by calculating used width per row and offsetting from the global max width.
 * Output structure: Inner grid built from packed shapes (no overlaps, background-filled), then wrapped in a thickness=2 border of background color; if no shapes, output a single background cell (or bordered version).
 * Subtleties: Normalization can alter shape appearance (e.g., rotation only once may not always canonicalize rectangles properly; vertical flip logic depends on even/odd rotations and half-point splits, which may misorient asymmetric shapes). Gaps are fixed at 2, but only between shapes in a row (no leading/trailing gaps). Row heights are determined by the tallest shape in the row, with shapes aligned at top-left within their bounding box. Empty rows or single-shape rows must still be centered. Colors are preserved, but if normalization changes positions, it can shift pixel placements. Potential edge cases: all-background input, single-pixel shapes (ignored), non-square shapes that don't normalize well, or shapes touching the border. The output dimensions grow based on content (inner height = sum of row max heights; inner width = max row used width; final = inner + 4 thickness).

def flip_horizontal(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(r, w - 1 - c) for r, c in pos]
```
(These are core for normalization: translation, bounding, and transformations; useful but the full normalize_shape logic needs tuning for accuracy.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled Training example 1, extracting, normalizing, packing, and bordering shapes to match the expected output.
 * For Training example 2, the generated output is INCORRECT: shapes are extracted and normalized but placed in wrong positions and orientations—e.g., color 1 (likely a square or L-shape) appears in rows 2-8 but shifted left and split incorrectly across rows with color 5 and 4 misplaced nearby; color 4 is fragmented and not in the expected long horizontal bar in rows 5-6; color 6 is correctly at bottom but color 5 is in wrong spot; overall layout has extra empty rows and no proper centering, leading to a taller/misaligned grid compared to expected (which has compact rows with 4 at top-right, 5 left-middle, 1 bottom-left, 6 bottom).
 * Sorting by min row/col works for order but fails if shapes overlap in original positions or if normalization rotates them unexpectedly.
 * Normalization is partially helpful but broken/subtle issues: single 90-degree rotation if h!=w forces non-square shapes incorrectly (e.g., long bars become vertical when horizontal expected); vertical flip logic based on half-counts misorients shapes where pixel distribution is even or asymmetric (e.g., may flip an "upright" shape upside-down); horizontal flip on bottom quadrants biases left but over-applies if shape is centered.
 * Packing into rows with capacity=2*max_h and gap=2 works for simple cases but fails when shapes have varying heights (tall shapes force short rows, causing misalignment); centering assumes global max width but doesn't pad rows evenly.
 * Border addition with thickness=2 is correct and consistent.
 * extract_all_main_shapes is essential and works well for isolation; flood_fill is reliable for components.
 * build_rows and get_all_cells are helpful for packing but produce incorrect offsets in complex layouts (e.g., start_x calculation centers but ignores per-row height variations).
 * The full program handles empty grids but assumes rectangular input; no error for non-uniform row lengths.
 * Unknown reason for exact shape distortions in Training 2 (possibly rotation/flip combo in normalize_shape altering pixel connectivity or bounding).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears malformed or overcomplicated: it generates a very tall (32+ rows) grid with shapes like long horizontal 8/9 bars at top/middle/bottom, vertical 3's on right, scattered 5/6 clusters, but lacks clear row packing—e.g., rows 2-4 have mixed 8 and 3's without gaps, row 11-20 has fragmented 5's extending irregularly (some rows have 13 5's, others partial), and centering is absent (shapes hug left with uneven background). This suggests over-extraction (possibly including small components or misidentifying background=4), failed normalization (bars not rotated to canonical, 5's not squared), or packing errors (capacity too small, leading to many short rows; gaps not enforced). It doesn't match a sensible "catalog" layout—expected would likely be 4-6 compact rows of normalized tetromino-like shapes (e.g., I, O, T, L pieces in colors 3,5,6,8,9) centered with thickness=2 border, shorter and more organized. To handle test, need better normalization (multi-rotation trials for minimal bounding or chirality), dynamic capacity/gap based on shapes, and stricter component filtering.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to detect and extract distinct "main" shapes (connected components of non-background cells, filtered by size) from an input grid, normalize each shape's position and orientation to a canonical form (via translation, rotation, and flips based on geometric properties), sort them by their original positions, and then repack them into a new compact grid layout with specific packing rules, gaps, alignment, and a surrounding border of background color—all while preserving the original colors of the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent non-zero color in the grid; zero (0) represents empty space but is not considered for bg—ensure this doesn't misidentify bg in grids with sparse or uneven color distribution.
 * Only extract "main shapes": connected components (4-directional flood fill) of the same color with size >=4 cells; ignore smaller blobs, single cells, or bg-colored components—subtlety: components must be exactly the same color, and bg cells block connectivity.
 * Normalization is multi-step and asymmetric: (1) Translate to (0,0) origin based on min row/col. (2) Rotate 90° CW repeatedly until height <= width (while h > w), tracking rotation count. (3) Vertical flip decision based on top/bottom half cell counts, but flipped logic depending on even/odd rotations (e.g., for even rotations, flip if bottom >= top; for odd, flip if top >= bottom)—this ensures a "preferred" vertical orientation but can be tricky if halves are equal (no flip). (4) After vertical adjustment, horizontal flip if bottom-right quadrant has more cells than bottom-left (using floor(h/2) and floor(w/2) for quadrants)—this canonicalizes left-right asymmetry. Subtlety: re-translate after each transform, and bounding box (h,w) must be recomputed each time; equal counts in flip decisions default to no flip.
 * Sorting: After extraction, sort shapes by original min row, then min col of their positions (not normalized)—this preserves input order for arrangement but can lead to unexpected row breaks if positions are clustered oddly.
 * Arrangement: Pack shapes into rows greedily left-to-right with horizontal gap=2 between shapes; limit row width to cap=2*max_h (where max_h is global max normalized height) to avoid overly wide rows. Vertical gap=0 between rows. For rows with multiple shapes: left-align at x=0. For single-shape rows: right-align by starting at inner_w - used_w (where inner_w = max used width across all rows)—this creates asymmetric centering that may not visually balance if shapes vary in width. Total inner grid height = sum(row heights) + v_gap*(rows-1); pad inner grid to uniform width with bg. Finally, add a border of thickness=2 all around with bg color—subtlety: this expands dimensions by 4 in each direction, and empty grids return a single bg cell.
 * Edge cases: Empty input or no main shapes → single bg cell. Shapes with h==w after rotation don't rotate further. Quadrant counts use >= half_r for bottom, < half_c for left (floor division, so odd dimensions may unbalance quadrants). Packing may create uneven rows if cap is hit mid-row. Original positions influence sort but not placement offsets.
 * Potential pitfalls: Misidentifying bg leads to extracting bg as a shape. Normalization flips/rotations can alter perceived shape if counts tie (no flip). Single-row right-alignment may not match expected centering. Gap=2 is fixed but may need adjustment if shapes touch in expected output. Sorting by original position assumes top-left priority, but if shapes overlap in min coords, ties may break wrongly.

            new_grid[thickness + i][thickness + j] = grid[i][j]
    return new_grid
```
(This correctly adds uniform border; thickness=2 is fixed but matches examples.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) succeeded on Training example 1, correctly extracting, normalizing, and arranging simple shapes with proper bg=3, borders, and packing—indicating core extraction and normalization work for basic cases with few shapes.
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated a 20x16 grid (after border) with shapes (1's as 2x8 horizontal bars, 5's as 2x2, 4's as L/varied, 6's as 4x2/2x4) packed in 4 rows but left-aligned overall, with incorrect order (e.g., 1's top-left, then 5's/4's/6's below); dimensions mismatch expected 24x20 (wider due to better packing?); shapes misplaced (e.g., generated has 1's at rows 2-5 cols 2-9, but expected has 1's bottom at rows 19-22 cols 2-5/6-7; 4's expected wider and centered differently; 5's and 6's swapped positions/rotations). Subtlety: likely wrong normalization (e.g., rotations/flips altered shapes differently) or packing (greedy row-breaking hit cap too early, leading to more/narrower rows; single-row alignment right-shifted some shapes oddly).
 * Sorting by original min row/col worked for train1 but may have grouped shapes wrongly in train2 if input positions clustered vertically/horizontally.
 * Packing logic partially worked (gaps=2, v_gap=0, cap=2*max_h) but produced narrower inner_w=12 vs expected ~16, suggesting cap too restrictive or normalization increased widths unevenly.
 * Border addition worked (thickness=2, bg fill), but overall dims wrong due to inner grid errors.
 * Flood fill and extraction helpful and correct (identified all main shapes by color/size), but size >=4 filter may have included/excluded edge blobs if input has them.
 * Normalization functions are helpful but subtle bugs: vertical flip logic (even/odd rotation dependency) may over/under-flip if top/bottom equal; horizontal flip only if br > bl (strict >, so ties keep original); rotation stops at h<=w but doesn't prefer square or minimal bbox.
 * Arrangement code has issues: for len(row)==1, right-align (start_x = inner_w - used_w) may not match expected left/center; multi-row left-align at 0 assumes uniform padding, but max_used inner_w pads right with bg correctly yet leads to asymmetry.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but the full packing/row-building loop is buggy (greedy while loop breaks rows suboptimally; used_w calc assumes temp_start but doesn't account for padding properly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (24x18 grid, bg=4) extracts and arranges 5+ shapes (8's as large 3x9 horizontals, 3's as 3x1 verticals, 5's as extended 5x3/3x9, 9's as 7x3 verticals with protrusions, 6's as 3x9 horizontals) in ~6 rows with gaps and border, but without the test input grid, it's impossible to verify exact correctness—however, it follows the same logic as the failed train2, so likely incorrect in normalization/packing/order.
 * Does not look fully correct: Shapes like 8's and 9's appear over-rotated (e.g., 8's are wide horizontals in rows 2-4/9-11/21-23, but if input had verticals, rotation while h>w may have forced unwanted 90° turns); 5's have irregular extensions (rows 14-20 cols 7-16, looking like a cross or plus, possibly wrong flip); 3's are tiny verticals (rows 2-4/21-23 cols 13-15) placed as "spacers" but may be misextracted if input bg=4 surrounded them oddly. Packing seems greedy (rows break at cap~18? but inner_w=14, leading to left-heavy layout); single-shape rows (e.g., bottom 6's) right-aligned, creating imbalance. Compared to train2 failure, this likely has similar issues: wrong dims (expected may be wider/taller), misplaced shapes (e.g., 3's should integrate differently), and normalization artifacts (e.g., 5's/6's look flipped horizontally incorrectly if br_count == bl_count).
 * Missing elements: No clear centering for all rows (only singles right-aligned, which may not match); potential over-extraction if small 3's blobs <4 cells were included erroneously (but code filters >=4, so maybe input has exactly 3-cell? Wait, code would skip). To handle test, need input grid to confirm, but output doesn't "make sense" as a canonical repack—looks fragmented, with unused space (e.g., cols 16-14 empty in many rows), suggesting packing cap or gap=2 too tight.
 * Account for tests with tall/narrow shapes (e.g., 9's 7-high) by ensuring rotation minimizes height but respects h<=w; variable shape counts (5+ here vs 4 in train2) may need better row balancing beyond greedy.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting distinct connected components (shapes) of non-background colors from a grid (considering only components with 4+ cells), normalizing their positions, orientations, and flips to a canonical form, and then rearranging them into a new bordered grid in a packed layout sorted by original position, likely to create a "catalog" or standardized arrangement of the shapes while preserving their colors and relative topologies.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Extract only "main" shapes: Connected components (4-directional flood fill) of the same color, excluding background (most common color) and small components (<4 cells); ignore isolated cells or tiny groups.
 * Normalization is multi-step and orientation-sensitive: Translate to (0,0) origin; rotate 90° CW repeatedly until height <= width (to prefer landscape); for vertical flip, compare mass above/below midline (favor more mass on top, but logic flips based on rotations %2 and top/bottom counts); for horizontal flip, compare mass in bottom-left vs bottom-right quadrants (favor more in bottom-left). This ensures shapes are in a "standard" pose, but the flip conditions are asymmetric and depend on parity of rotations, which can lead to inconsistencies if not handled carefully.
 * Sorting: Components sorted by original min row, then min column in the input grid, to process in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
 * Layout packing: Use a row-based packing with max row width = 2 * max normalized height (cap), gap=2 between shapes; start new row when next shape won't fit; in new row, place at x=0 or slightly overlapping previous row's end (max(0, last_row_end - w +1), which can cause slight overlaps or shifts); compute total dimensions from placements, fill with background, add 2-cell border.
 * Background identification: Most frequent non-zero color; if all zero, use 0.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Rotations change coordinate interpretations (e.g., vertical mass comparison inverts after odd rotations); flip logic isn't symmetric (e.g., vertical flip only if bottom >= top in even rotations, or top >= bottom in odd); horizontal flip only checks bottom half; bounding box after each transform; placement logic can misalign rows if previous row ends near cap, leading to suboptimal packing or unintended overlaps; shapes must retain exact relative positions after normalization but absolute offsets are discarded; output must match exact dimensions and positions, including duplicated rows for thick shapes (e.g., many 2-row shapes in input lead to paired rows in output).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns [[bg]]; single shape or no main shapes return bordered bg grid; varying shape thicknesses (e.g., 2 rows per shape in output if original was 2-high); colors preserved but not sorted by color—by position.
 * All considerations: Flood fill must be same-color only; visited prevents re-processing; deque for BFS efficiency; after all transforms, re-translate to origin; total_w computed as max offset + shape width; inner grid sized to fit placements exactly before bordering.

(Note: The above are helpful for extraction, normalization, and bordering; the main `program` function below integrates them but has placement bugs—use as base but fix packing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission shown; it correctly handled Training example 1 by extracting, normalizing, and packing shapes into a bordered grid matching the expected layout.
 * For Training example 2, it failed: Generated a 22x16 grid (shorter width, fewer columns) with shapes misplaced and in wrong order/positions—e.g., shape 1 (likely a small L or bar) placed mid-top-left but expected bottom; shape 4 (large block) split across rows incorrectly with 5 and 6 overlapping its space; shape 5 duplicated at bottom but expected mid-right; shape 6 (another block) low but expected mid; overall, rows are paired but packing overflows or shifts left incorrectly, leading to a denser but misaligned layout vs expected's wider 28x20 grid with shapes in position-sorted order (4 top-right, then 5+4 combo mid, 6 bottom-mid, 1 bottom-left with 5 extension).
 * Normalization worked partially (shapes retain topology) but may have over-rotated or mis-flipped some (e.g., shape 4 appears vertically stacked in generated but horizontally in expected).
 * Sorting by min row/col worked for order but placement logic broke: The "place_x = max(0, last_row_end - w +1)" causes unwanted left-shifts/overlaps in new rows, and cap=2*max_h is too narrow for this input's shapes, leading to more rows than expected.
 * Extraction via flood_fill is essential and correct (identifies components >=4 cells accurately).
 * Background ID correct (3 in train2).
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one missed handling wider layouts and row-start alignments (e.g., new rows should start at x=0 always, not shift based on prev end).
 * Function `program` (full integrator) is mostly helpful but broken in placement—fix the packing loop to avoid shifts and use wider cap or dynamic width.
 * No unhelpful functions here; all are relevant, but the packing in `program` is buggy (don't reuse as-is).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's a 36x18 grid (tall and narrow) with shapes 3,5,6,8,9 packed densely in columns, many duplicated rows (e.g., 3-row shapes repeated 3x, suggesting thick vertical stacking), but overlaps and misplacements—e.g., small shape 3 appears multiple times low-right but likely should be isolated; large 8 block spans top but fragmented; 5's extension (row17-19) overlaps 9's space below; 6's wide base at bottom but shifted left unnaturally; overall packing ignores position-sorting (e.g., 9 before 6?), uses bg=4, but layout feels vertical-biased instead of row-packed, missing expected horizontal spread and borders around isolated shapes—likely due to same placement bugs as train2 (narrow cap, shift logic causing cascades), resulting in a cluttered "tower" vs what should be a balanced catalog with shapes in original-order rows; without input grid, can't confirm exact expected, but it doesn't match puzzle intent of clean, sorted rearrangement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

[2025-10-01 03:14:13] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting distinct colored shapes (connected components) from an input grid while ignoring the background, normalizing their positions and orientations for standardization, and then repacking them into a new compact grid layout with gaps between shapes, row-based packing constrained by a width cap, centering or alignment for single shapes per row, and a surrounding border. The goal is to produce an output grid that visually reorganizes the shapes in a consistent, puzzle-like arrangement that matches expected layouts for training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background identification uses the most common non-zero color, but only if present; empty grids default to [[0]] or [[bg]].
 * Shapes are extracted only if they are connected components of the same color with at least 4 cells, ignoring smaller blobs or background; this filters out noise but may miss tiny intentional elements if under 4 cells.
 * Normalization is multi-step: translate to (0,0) origin, rotate 90° CW if height > width (to prefer landscape), always flip vertical (upside-down), re-translate, then conditionally flip horizontal based on density in bottom half (more cells in bottom-right triggers flip to favor bottom-left heavy).
 * Packing uses rows where each row's total width (shape widths + gaps of 2) is capped at 2 * max shape height across all shapes; shapes are added greedily to rows, starting new rows when cap exceeded; for rows with multiple shapes, they are left-aligned from x=0; for single-shape rows, they are right-aligned (start_x = inner_w - w), which may cause asymmetry or unexpected positioning.
 * Inner grid height is sum of max row heights; width is max used width across rows; shapes are placed at current y, with x accumulating widths + gaps, but no vertical centering within rows (shapes align to top of row).
 * Border adds 2 layers of background around the inner grid on all sides, expanding dimensions accordingly.
 * Sorting components by min row then min col before processing ensures consistent order (top-left first), but may not match puzzle's intended visual or canonical order (e.g., by color or size).
 * Subtlety: After rotations/flips, bounding box is recalculated, but if a shape becomes square or changes dimensions oddly, it could lead to mismatched sizes; vertical flip is unconditional, which might invert expected orientations.
 * Grids can be rectangular (different row lengths in output? No, code enforces uniform width with bg padding implicitly via list init); empty/no shapes return single bg cell.
 * Potential miss: Code assumes 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right, no diagonals) in flood fill; if puzzle uses 8-connectivity, shapes might split incorrectly.
 * Output rows are duplicated in pairs in the provided examples (e.g., every shape appears in two identical rows), suggesting the puzzle renders shapes as 2-pixel high lines or the input/output is vertically scaled, but code doesn't explicitly duplicate— this might be an artifact of how outputs are printed, but it mismatches if expected has unique rows.
 * High-level rule: Repacking should visually group shapes horizontally in rows without overlapping, preserving colors and relative connectivity, but the right-align for singles and greedy packing can lead to inefficient or non-canonical layouts.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, using the above program.
 * Worked for Training example 1: Produced correct output, indicating core extraction, normalization, packing, and bordering logic handles simple cases well (likely fewer or simpler shapes).
 * Failed for Training example 2: Generated a 20-row by 16-column grid (with duplicated rows for each shape level), but expected is 20-row by 20-column; shapes are packed differently—e.g., generated has 1's and 5's paired horizontally in top rows, 4's below, then 6's, but expected spreads them vertically with 4's on right, 6's on right, 1's and 5's at bottom-left, and an extra unpaired 5 at bottom; right-alignment for singles likely caused misalignment, and cap/gap led to more vertical stacking instead of wider rows; sorting by position may have ordered shapes wrong for this input.
 * Duplicated rows in generated output (every shape row appears twice identically) matches the printed format but may not be intended if expected has unique rows—unclear if this is a rendering artifact or code error (code doesn't duplicate explicitly).
 * Normalization seems to work (shapes retain connectivity and color), but unconditional vertical flip or density-based horizontal flip may invert some shapes unexpectedly for Train 2.
 * Packing greedy approach missed wider row opportunities, leading to taller/narrower grid vs. expected squarer layout.
 * extract_all_main_shapes is essential and correct for identifying main shapes via flood fill, filtering >=4 cells.
 * pack_shapes is helpful but flawed—right-align for singles and fixed cap=2*max_h create asymmetry; consider left/center align or dynamic cap.
 * normalize is core and helpful for standardization but subtle bugs in flip logic (e.g., always vertical flip) may cause orientation mismatches.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but if 8-connectivity is needed, flood_fill directions should include diagonals (currently 4-connectivity may split shapes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 32-row by 18-column grid (with apparent duplications, e.g., many paired identical rows), featuring shapes of colors 3,5,6,8,9 packed in a tall, narrow layout: top has 8's and 3's mixed vertically, then 5's expanding rightward, then 9's with 3's, then 6's at bottom; bordered by 4's (likely bg=4).
 * It does not look correct: The layout is overly vertical and stacked (e.g., multiple single-shape rows right-aligned?), unlike the squarer, horizontally grouped expected from Train 2; shapes like 8's and 9's appear rotated or flipped oddly (e.g., 8's form L-shapes vertically), and 5's/6's have irregular extensions that may result from normalization failures on complex shapes; small 3's are placed as accents but mispositioned relative to larger blobs; overall, it resembles the Train 2 error—greedy packing and alignment cause inefficiency, and without the actual test input grid, it's hard to verify extraction, but the output's asymmetry and height suggest it won't match a canonical repack (likely expects wider rows with better centering).
 * Missing elements: No clear horizontal grouping of similar shapes; border thickness=2 is applied but grid width=18 seems too narrow for the number of shapes (at least 6 distinct: 3,5,6,8,9 + bg4), implying cap too restrictive; potential over-extraction if small 3's are noise <4 cells but included somehow.
 * To handle test: Increase cap flexibility (e.g., based on total width), use center-align for all rows, sort shapes by size/color instead of position, and verify no row duplications in final grid.
