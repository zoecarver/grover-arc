=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 17:37:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-09-30 17:47:21] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where connected components (blobs) of 1's (likely foreground objects) are analyzed for holes within the surrounding 4's (background), and the output grid is modified to highlight borders (2's), filled blobs with holes (8's), holes themselves (6's), while preserving 1's for solid objects without holes and leaving untouched areas as 4's. The goal is to detect blob topology, add precise bordering, and differentiate solid vs. holed objects, possibly simulating a "paint" or "object enhancement" effect.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of 1's; holes are enclosed 4-regions fully surrounded by a blob (not connected to grid edges).
 * For blobs with holes: Fill the blob cells with 8, holes with 6; add borders (2's) on adjacent 4's, including horizontal gaps within rows (using 8 for internal non-edge gaps, 2 for top/bottom), vertical borders on left/right if adjacent to 4's, and extended top/bottom border rows covering the blob's row projection plus one cell overhang.
 * For solid blobs (no holes): Keep 1's intact, but add borders (2's) on adjacent 4's, including per-row left/right borders, and top/bottom border rows with overhang; if the top row of the blob is narrower than the max width, fill that row's blob cells with 2's (treating it as a "cap").
 * Gaps in rows: For holed blobs, fill left/right gaps with 2 if top/bottom row, else 8; ensure global min/max columns are used for alignment.
 * Border placement: Only overwrite 4's with 2's; extend top/bottom borders to cover the row's min/max cols ±1; vertical borders only if directly adjacent and on 4's.
 * Hole detection: Use flood-fill from edges to mark reachable 4's, then any 4's adjacent to blob but unreachable are holes (mark with 6); single-cell or trivial components have no holes.
 * Subtleties: Overhang in top/bottom borders (±1 col); for solid blobs, top-row "cap" with 2's only if narrower; preserve 1's in solid blobs but border them; handle multi-row/multi-col components correctly without over-bordering; in train1, lower solid blobs need precise bordering without filling internals; in train2, complex shapes require accurate gap filling and border alignment across irregular widths.
 * Edge cases: Blobs touching grid edges (no external border there); disconnected holes; blobs with internal 4's that are not fully enclosed (not holes); components with varying row widths; solid blobs spanning full width (no side borders).
 * All attempts must copy the input grid and only modify 4's or 1's as specified; untouched areas remain 4's; 1's become 8 only if holed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copies grid to avoid mutating input; essential for all processing.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS stack to find 4-connected components of 1's, marking visited.
    # Returns list of components, each a list of (row, col) positions.
    # Helpful: Correctly identifies blobs; used in all attempts.
```
(Reliable for extracting connected 1's; no issues observed.)

```python
def get_row_info(component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, Dict[int, Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    # Computes min_r, max_r, per-row dict of (min_col, max_col, width), and global max_width.
    # Helpful: Essential for handling row-wise gaps and borders in irregular blobs.
```
(Useful for gap filling and border extension; accurate in current attempt.)

```python
def detect_holes(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[bool, set]:
    # Temporarily marks blob as 3's; flood-fills from edges to mark reachable 4's.
    # Then, for 4's adjacent to blob, flood-fills unreachable ones as holes (returns bool has_hole and set of hole positions).
    # Helpful: Correctly distinguishes enclosed holes; used successfully in train3.
```
(Key for hole detection; works well but may need tuning for adjacency in complex shapes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; train1 INCORRECT: Generated overfills row 6 with 8's in left section (e.g., positions 2-7 as 8's instead of 2's in a solid-like top cap), row 7 starts borders too early (2's from col 2 instead of col 5), and row 8 has extra 2's in left (cols 5-10) vs expected starting later; lower solid blob in row 11 has incomplete right borders (only up to col 4 as 2's, missing extension to col 9); unknown why gap filling misaligns with global min/max cols.
 * Train2 INCORRECT: Generated fills unintended areas, e.g., row 1 has extra 2's in cols 10-21 where expected has 8's and 2's differently; row 2 has 1's preserved but borders misaligned (e.g., col 11 as 8 instead of 2); lower sections like row 18 have 4's where expected has 2's in borders, and row 23 has 1's in col 4 misplaced (expected 2's); side borders and top caps not overhanging correctly, leading to missing 2's in irregular shapes.
 * Train3 CORRECT: All blob detections, hole fillings (6's), 8's, and borders (2's with proper overhangs and gaps) match expected, indicating core logic works for simpler or aligned cases.
 * find_components and get_row_info are essential and accurate; detect_holes works but may over/under-detect adjacency in train1/2 due to temp marking or flood-fill starting points.
 * Gaps in holed blobs not using correct color (2 vs 8) for non-top/bottom rows in train1.
 * Solid blob top-cap logic (filling with 2's if narrower) applied incorrectly in train1 (overfills).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though detect_holes could be refined for better adj4 collection.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect overall, as it applies holed-blob logic (8's and 6's in upper right blob) and solid bordering (2's around lower blobs) sensibly, but inconsistencies suggest issues: e.g., upper blob's bottom rows (e.g., row 9-11) have 8's extending to col 16 as 4 instead of bordered 2's or filled; lower left solid blob in rows 12-17 has 1's preserved but borders missing overhang (e.g., row 12 col 18-24 should extend 2's further?); small blob in rows 17-20 has borders but row 17 col 6-12 as 1's without side 2's adjacent to 4's; right lower holed blob (rows 21-24) has 6's correctly but top border row 20 has 2's not overhanging left of min col; overall, borders seem under-extended in places (no ±1 col overhang consistently), and some 4's adjacent to solids remain unbordered (e.g., row 14 cols 7-16), which mismatches rules from training expects; without expected, it "makes sense" for hole detection but fails precise bordering like in train1/2 errors—likely needs better global min/max per component and conditional overhang.

 * For solid blobs (no holes): Keep 1's intact, but add borders (2's) on adjacent 4's, including per-row left/right borders, and top/bottom border rows with overhang; if the top row of the blob is narrower than the max width, fill that row's blob cells with 2's (treating it as a "cap").
 * Gaps in rows: For holed blobs, fill left/right gaps with 2 if top/bottom row, else 8; ensure global min/max columns are used for alignment.
 * Border placement: Only overwrite 4's with 2's; extend top/bottom borders to cover the row's min/max cols ±1; vertical borders only if directly adjacent and on 4's.
 * Hole detection: Use flood-fill from edges to mark reachable 4's, then any 4's adjacent to blob but unreachable are holes (mark with 6); single-cell or trivial components have no holes.
 * Subtleties: Overhang in top/bottom borders (±1 col); for solid blobs, top-row "cap" with 2's only if narrower; preserve 1's in solid blobs but border them; handle multi-row/multi-col components correctly without over-bordering; in train1, lower solid blobs need precise bordering without filling internals; in train2, complex shapes require accurate gap filling and border alignment across irregular widths.
 * Edge cases: Blobs touching grid edges (no external border there); disconnected holes; blobs with internal 4's that are not fully enclosed (not holes); components with varying row widths; solid blobs spanning full width (no side borders).
 * All attempts must copy the input grid and only modify 4's or 1's as specified; untouched areas remain 4's; 1's become 8 only if holed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copies grid to avoid mutating input; essential for all processing.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS stack to find 4-connected components of 1's, marking visited.
    # Returns list of components, each a list of (row, col) positions.
    # Helpful: Correctly identifies blobs; used in all attempts.
```
(Reliable for extracting connected 1's; no issues observed.)

```python
def get_row_info(component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, Dict[int, Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    # Computes min_r, max_r, per-row dict of (min_col, max_col, width), and global max_width.
    # Helpful: Essential for handling row-wise gaps and borders in irregular blobs.
```
(Useful for gap filling and border extension; accurate in current attempt.)

```python
def detect_holes(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[bool, set]:
    # Temporarily marks blob as 3's; flood-fills from edges to mark reachable 4's.
    # Then, for 4's adjacent to blob, flood-fills unreachable ones as holes (returns bool has_hole and set of hole positions).
    # Helpful: Correctly distinguishes enclosed holes; used successfully in train3.
```
(Key for hole detection; works well but may need tuning for adjacency in complex shapes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; train1 INCORRECT: Generated overfills row 6 with 8's in left section (e.g., positions 2-7 as 8's instead of 2's in a solid-like top cap), row 7 starts borders too early (2's from col 2 instead of col 5), and row 8 has extra 2's in left (cols 5-10) vs expected starting later; lower solid blob in row 11 has incomplete right borders (only up to col 4 as 2's, missing extension to col 9); unknown why gap filling misaligns with global min/max cols.
 * Train2 INCORRECT: Generated fills unintended areas, e.g., row 1 has extra 2's in cols 10-21 where expected has 8's and 2's differently; row 2 has 1's preserved but borders misaligned (e.g., col 11 as 8 instead of 2); lower sections like row 18 have 4's where expected has 2's in borders, and row 23 has 1's in col 4 misplaced (expected 2's); side borders and top caps not overhanging correctly, leading to missing 2's in irregular shapes.
 * Train3 CORRECT: All blob detections, hole fillings (6's), 8's, and borders (2's with proper overhangs and gaps) match expected, indicating core logic works for simpler or aligned cases.
 * find_components and get_row_info are essential and accurate; detect_holes works but may over/under-detect adjacency in train1/2 due to temp marking or flood-fill starting points.
 * Gaps in holed blobs not using correct color (2 vs 8) for non-top/bottom rows in train1.
 * Solid blob top-cap logic (filling with 2's if narrower) applied incorrectly in train1 (overfills).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though detect_holes could be refined for better adj4 collection.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect overall, as it applies holed-blob logic (8's and 6's in upper right blob) and solid bordering (2's around lower blobs) sensibly, but inconsistencies suggest issues: e.g., upper blob's bottom rows (e.g., row 9-11) have 8's extending to col 16 as 4 instead of bordered 2's or filled; lower left solid blob in rows 12-17 has 1's preserved but borders missing overhang (e.g., row 12 col 18-24 should extend 2's further?); small blob in rows 17-20 has borders but row 17 col 6-12 as 1's without side 2's adjacent to 4's; right lower holed blob (rows 21-24) has 6's correctly but top border row 20 has 2's not overhanging left of min col; overall, borders seem under-extended in places (no ±1 col overhang consistently), and some 4's adjacent to solids remain unbordered (e.g., row 14 cols 7-16), which mismatches rules from training expects; without expected, it "makes sense" for hole detection but fails precise bordering like in train1/2 errors—likely needs better global min/max per component and conditional overhang.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 17:56:30] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-processing puzzle where the input grid contains background (4), solid object pixels (1), and possibly other markers, and the goal is to identify connected components of objects, detect enclosed holes (isolated 4's within components), modify holed components by marking them as filled/special (8) with holes as interior (6), cap narrower top/bottom edges of solid (no-hole) components with borders (2) without overextending, and finally apply global bordering to background pixels adjacent to modified objects. The output transforms the grid to highlight object structures, holes, and edges while preserving untouched areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) for objects (1's); use DFS or BFS (e.g., stack or queue) to find them without visiting already-processed cells.
 * Hole detection requires flood-filling from grid borders to mark exterior background (4's connected to edges) separately (e.g., as 5 temporarily), then identifying any unmarked 4's fully enclosed within a component's boundary as holes—these must be isolated from the outer world but adjacent to the component.
 * For components with holes: Entire component becomes 8 (indicating holed/filled object), and detected holes become 6 (interior voids); do not apply capping to these.
 * For solid components (no holes): Only cap the top (min row) and bottom (max row) if their width is less than the component's global max width—set the narrower row's object pixels to 2 (edge cap), and optionally extend 2 to immediate adjacent 4's in the same row on left/right if they exist, but do not overextend or alter non-narrow rows; avoid turning solid 1's into 2's prematurely or capping non-edge rows.
 * Global bordering: After all modifications, scan all remaining 4's and set to 2 if 8-directionally adjacent to any 1 or 8 (but not to 2 or 6, to avoid over-bordering); this creates outlines around objects but skips pure interiors or already-capped areas.
 * Subtleties: Components may span multiple rows/columns irregularly (e.g., protrusions or L-shapes), so row-width calculation must use min/max cols per row accurately; holes can be multi-cell and must be fully flood-filled per enclosed region; do not treat exterior 4's as holes; solid object protrusions (e.g., thin bars) should retain 1's in the middle unless truly narrower edges; background remains 4 unless bordered; grid edges are implicit borders for flood-fill; assume uniform grid dimensions and no diagonal connections for components/holes unless specified.
 * Edge cases: Empty components, single-cell objects (no capping needed), objects touching grid borders (affects hole detection), multiple components per grid, holes touching component edges but not exterior, solid objects with varying widths where only true top/bottom get capped; avoid modifying 1's to 2/8 unless rules apply; preserve original 1's in solid non-capped areas.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copies grid to avoid mutating input.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses stack-based DFS to find 4-connected components of 1's, marking visited.
    # Returns list of lists, each inner list containing (row, col) tuples for one component.
    # Helpful for isolating objects; assumes h=len(g), w=len(g[0]), dirs=[(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)].
```
(Extracts object components accurately; essential for per-object processing.)

```python
def get_row_info(component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, Dict[int, Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    # Computes min_r, max_r, row_dict (per-row min_c, max_c, width), and max_width across component.
    # Useful for identifying top/bottom rows and checking if they need capping (width < max_width).
```
(Key for solid object capping logic; handles irregular shapes by per-row analysis.)

```python
def detect_holes(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[bool, set]:
    # Temporarily marks component as 3, flood-fills border-connected 4's as 5 (exterior).
    # Then flood-fills unmarked 4's adjacent to component as holes, returning has_hole flag and set of hole positions.
    # Critical for distinguishing enclosed vs. exterior background; uses two separate BFS/queues.
```
(Essential for hole detection; correctly handles multi-cell holes but requires careful adjacency checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly identifies components and detects holes (e.g., sets 8 for holed objects and 6 for interiors, as seen in training 1 rows 2-7 and test output rows 2-10), and applies global bordering appropriately in many cases (e.g., 2's outlining objects without overfill).
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated overextended capping on the bottom solid horizontal bar—row 10 has extra 2's to the right of the 1's (positions ~14-19 as 2 instead of 4), and row 11 has 1's incorrectly surrounded by extended 2's (e.g., positions 14-19 as 2,2,2,2,2,2 instead of 4's); also row 7 has 2's in positions where expected has 8's uncapped. This suggests capping logic applies 2's too broadly, turning adjacent 4's into 2's beyond the narrower row or altering solid 1's; unknown why row 11's 1's are flanked by extra 2's instead of minimal bordering.
 * Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Similar capping errors on solid protrusions—row 7 generated all 2's across what should be a solid 1-row object (positions 1-5 as 2,2,2,2,2 instead of 1,1,1,1,1), and row 8 has extra 1's turned to 2's (position 0 as 2 instead of expected partial); bottom section (rows 22-25) has mismatched 1's and 2's in protrusions (e.g., row 23 generated 2,1,1,2 but expected 2,2,1,2 or similar shifts); row 7 also misses retaining 1's in the middle of solid bars. Hole detection worked (8's and 6's match), but global bordering over-applied in solid areas.
 * Training example 3 (CORRECT): All modifications matched expected, implying the logic handles that specific case (likely a mix of holed/solid without capping issues) perfectly—no differences noted.
 * Function `add_global_borders` is helpful but subtly broken: It uses 8-directions correctly for adjacency to 1/8, but in combination with capping, it causes over-bordering of 4's near capped 2's; consider running it only after all other changes and excluding adjacency to 2's.
 * Overall, hole detection and component finding are solid (worked in all), but capping for solid objects fails by overextending 2's into adjacent 4's beyond the row or prematurely converting 1's to 2's; no unhelpful functions, but `detect_holes` temp-marking (to 3/5) is essential and correct—avoid simplifying it.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly detects and marks a large holed object (8's in rows 2-10 with 6's inside, e.g., row 3 positions ~13-15 as 6), applies minimal capping to solid protrusions (e.g., row 11 has 2's around a small 1-group without overextension), retains 1's in solid areas (e.g., rows 12-17 have clean 1's with bordering 2's), and adds global borders (2's outlining everything). However, it likely does not look fully correct based on training failures—e.g., row 10 has 2's in positions 13-16 that might be overextended capping similar to training 1 (expected might have 4's there if not adjacent to objects); row 21 has 2's around 1's that could be incorrectly capped if the object isn't narrower at bottom; row 22's 8's with 6's match hole rules but bordering in row 25 (extra 2's) might overapply like training 2. Without the input grid, can't confirm, but patterns suggest capping inconsistencies persist, missing subtle non-overextension for solid edges; account for multi-level protrusions (e.g., varying widths across heights) to fix test.

[2025-09-30 17:56:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where connected components (blobs) of 1's (likely foreground objects) are analyzed for holes within the surrounding 4's (background), and the output grid is modified to highlight borders (2's), filled blobs with holes (8's), holes themselves (6's), while preserving 1's for solid objects without holes and leaving untouched areas as 4's. The goal is to detect blob topology, add precise bordering, and differentiate solid vs. holed objects, possibly simulating a "paint" or "object enhancement" effect.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of 1's; holes are enclosed 4-regions fully surrounded by a blob (not connected to grid edges).
 * For blobs with holes: Fill the blob cells with 8, holes with 6; add borders (2's) on adjacent 4's, including horizontal gaps within rows (using 8 for internal non-edge gaps, 2 for top/bottom), vertical borders on left/right if adjacent to 4's, and extended top/bottom border rows covering the blob's row projection plus one cell overhang.
 * For solid blobs (no holes): Keep 1's intact, but add borders (2's) on adjacent 4's, including per-row left/right borders, and top/bottom border rows with overhang; if the top row of the blob is narrower than the max width, fill that row's blob cells with 2's (treating it as a "cap").
 * Gaps in rows: For holed blobs, fill left/right gaps with 2 if top/bottom row, else 8; ensure global min/max columns are used for alignment.
 * Border placement: Only overwrite 4's with 2's; extend top/bottom borders to cover the row's min/max cols ±1; vertical borders only if directly adjacent and on 4's.
 * Hole detection: Use flood-fill from edges to mark reachable 4's, then any 4's adjacent to blob but unreachable are holes (mark with 6); single-cell or trivial components have no holes.
 * Subtleties: Overhang in top/bottom borders (±1 col); for solid blobs, top-row "cap" with 2's only if narrower; preserve 1's in solid blobs but border them; handle multi-row/multi-col components correctly without over-bordering; in train1, lower solid blobs need precise bordering without filling internals; in train2, complex shapes require accurate gap filling and border alignment across irregular widths.
 * Edge cases: Blobs touching grid edges (no external border there); disconnected holes; blobs with internal 4's that are not fully enclosed (not holes); components with varying row widths; solid blobs spanning full width (no side borders).
 * All attempts must copy the input grid and only modify 4's or 1's as specified; untouched areas remain 4's; 1's become 8 only if holed.

from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

(Copies grid to avoid mutating input; essential for all processing.)

    # Uses DFS stack to find 4-connected components of 1's, marking visited.
    # Returns list of components, each a list of (row, col) positions.
    # Helpful: Correctly identifies blobs; used in all attempts.
```
(Reliable for extracting connected 1's; no issues observed.)

```python

    # Computes min_r, max_r, per-row dict of (min_col, max_col, width), and global max_width.
    # Helpful: Essential for handling row-wise gaps and borders in irregular blobs.
```
(Useful for gap filling and border extension; accurate in current attempt.)

```python
def detect_holes(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[bool, set]:
    # Temporarily marks blob as 3's; flood-fills from edges to mark reachable 4's.
    # Then, for 4's adjacent to blob, flood-fills unreachable ones as holes (returns bool has_hole and set of hole positions).
    # Helpful: Correctly distinguishes enclosed holes; used successfully in train3.
```
(Key for hole detection; works well but may need tuning for adjacency in complex shapes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; train1 INCORRECT: Generated overfills row 6 with 8's in left section (e.g., positions 2-7 as 8's instead of 2's in a solid-like top cap), row 7 starts borders too early (2's from col 2 instead of col 5), and row 8 has extra 2's in left (cols 5-10) vs expected starting later; lower solid blob in row 11 has incomplete right borders (only up to col 4 as 2's, missing extension to col 9); unknown why gap filling misaligns with global min/max cols.
 * Train2 INCORRECT: Generated fills unintended areas, e.g., row 1 has extra 2's in cols 10-21 where expected has 8's and 2's differently; row 2 has 1's preserved but borders misaligned (e.g., col 11 as 8 instead of 2); lower sections like row 18 have 4's where expected has 2's in borders, and row 23 has 1's in col 4 misplaced (expected 2's); side borders and top caps not overhanging correctly, leading to missing 2's in irregular shapes.
 * Train3 CORRECT: All blob detections, hole fillings (6's), 8's, and borders (2's with proper overhangs and gaps) match expected, indicating core logic works for simpler or aligned cases.
 * find_components and get_row_info are essential and accurate; detect_holes works but may over/under-detect adjacency in train1/2 due to temp marking or flood-fill starting points.
 * Gaps in holed blobs not using correct color (2 vs 8) for non-top/bottom rows in train1.
 * Solid blob top-cap logic (filling with 2's if narrower) applied incorrectly in train1 (overfills).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though detect_holes could be refined for better adj4 collection.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect overall, as it applies holed-blob logic (8's and 6's in upper right blob) and solid bordering (2's around lower blobs) sensibly, but inconsistencies suggest issues: e.g., upper blob's bottom rows (e.g., row 9-11) have 8's extending to col 16 as 4 instead of bordered 2's or filled; lower left solid blob in rows 12-17 has 1's preserved but borders missing overhang (e.g., row 12 col 18-24 should extend 2's further?); small blob in rows 17-20 has borders but row 17 col 6-12 as 1's without side 2's adjacent to 4's; right lower holed blob (rows 21-24) has 6's correctly but top border row 20 has 2's not overhanging left of min col; overall, borders seem under-extended in places (no ±1 col overhang consistently), and some 4's adjacent to solids remain unbordered (e.g., row 14 cols 7-16), which mismatches rules from training expects; without expected, it "makes sense" for hole detection but fails precise bordering like in train1/2 errors—likely needs better global min/max per component and conditional overhang.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-processing puzzle where the input grid contains background (4), solid object pixels (1), and possibly other markers, and the goal is to identify connected components of objects, detect enclosed holes (isolated 4's within components), modify holed components by marking them as filled/special (8) with holes as interior (6), cap narrower top/bottom edges of solid (no-hole) components with borders (2) without overextending, and finally apply global bordering to background pixels adjacent to modified objects. The output transforms the grid to highlight object structures, holes, and edges while preserving untouched areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) for objects (1's); use DFS or BFS (e.g., stack or queue) to find them without visiting already-processed cells.
 * Hole detection requires flood-filling from grid borders to mark exterior background (4's connected to edges) separately (e.g., as 5 temporarily), then identifying any unmarked 4's fully enclosed within a component's boundary as holes—these must be isolated from the outer world but adjacent to the component.
 * For components with holes: Entire component becomes 8 (indicating holed/filled object), and detected holes become 6 (interior voids); do not apply capping to these.
 * For solid components (no holes): Only cap the top (min row) and bottom (max row) if their width is less than the component's global max width—set the narrower row's object pixels to 2 (edge cap), and optionally extend 2 to immediate adjacent 4's in the same row on left/right if they exist, but do not overextend or alter non-narrow rows; avoid turning solid 1's into 2's prematurely or capping non-edge rows.
 * Global bordering: After all modifications, scan all remaining 4's and set to 2 if 8-directionally adjacent to any 1 or 8 (but not to 2 or 6, to avoid over-bordering); this creates outlines around objects but skips pure interiors or already-capped areas.
 * Subtleties: Components may span multiple rows/columns irregularly (e.g., protrusions or L-shapes), so row-width calculation must use min/max cols per row accurately; holes can be multi-cell and must be fully flood-filled per enclosed region; do not treat exterior 4's as holes; solid object protrusions (e.g., thin bars) should retain 1's in the middle unless truly narrower edges; background remains 4 unless bordered; grid edges are implicit borders for flood-fill; assume uniform grid dimensions and no diagonal connections for components/holes unless specified.
 * Edge cases: Empty components, single-cell objects (no capping needed), objects touching grid borders (affects hole detection), multiple components per grid, holes touching component edges but not exterior, solid objects with varying widths where only true top/bottom get capped; avoid modifying 1's to 2/8 unless rules apply; preserve original 1's in solid non-capped areas.

    # Useful for identifying top/bottom rows and checking if they need capping (width < max_width).
```
(Key for solid object capping logic; handles irregular shapes by per-row analysis.)

```python
def detect_holes(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[bool, set]:
    # Temporarily marks component as 3, flood-fills border-connected 4's as 5 (exterior).
    # Then flood-fills unmarked 4's adjacent to component as holes, returning has_hole flag and set of hole positions.
    # Critical for distinguishing enclosed vs. exterior background; uses two separate BFS/queues.
```
(Essential for hole detection; correctly handles multi-cell holes but requires careful adjacency checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly identifies components and detects holes (e.g., sets 8 for holed objects and 6 for interiors, as seen in training 1 rows 2-7 and test output rows 2-10), and applies global bordering appropriately in many cases (e.g., 2's outlining objects without overfill).
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated overextended capping on the bottom solid horizontal bar—row 10 has extra 2's to the right of the 1's (positions ~14-19 as 2 instead of 4), and row 11 has 1's incorrectly surrounded by extended 2's (e.g., positions 14-19 as 2,2,2,2,2,2 instead of 4's); also row 7 has 2's in positions where expected has 8's uncapped. This suggests capping logic applies 2's too broadly, turning adjacent 4's into 2's beyond the narrower row or altering solid 1's; unknown why row 11's 1's are flanked by extra 2's instead of minimal bordering.
 * Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Similar capping errors on solid protrusions—row 7 generated all 2's across what should be a solid 1-row object (positions 1-5 as 2,2,2,2,2 instead of 1,1,1,1,1), and row 8 has extra 1's turned to 2's (position 0 as 2 instead of expected partial); bottom section (rows 22-25) has mismatched 1's and 2's in protrusions (e.g., row 23 generated 2,1,1,2 but expected 2,2,1,2 or similar shifts); row 7 also misses retaining 1's in the middle of solid bars. Hole detection worked (8's and 6's match), but global bordering over-applied in solid areas.
 * Training example 3 (CORRECT): All modifications matched expected, implying the logic handles that specific case (likely a mix of holed/solid without capping issues) perfectly—no differences noted.
 * Function `add_global_borders` is helpful but subtly broken: It uses 8-directions correctly for adjacency to 1/8, but in combination with capping, it causes over-bordering of 4's near capped 2's; consider running it only after all other changes and excluding adjacency to 2's.
 * Overall, hole detection and component finding are solid (worked in all), but capping for solid objects fails by overextending 2's into adjacent 4's beyond the row or prematurely converting 1's to 2's; no unhelpful functions, but `detect_holes` temp-marking (to 3/5) is essential and correct—avoid simplifying it.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly detects and marks a large holed object (8's in rows 2-10 with 6's inside, e.g., row 3 positions ~13-15 as 6), applies minimal capping to solid protrusions (e.g., row 11 has 2's around a small 1-group without overextension), retains 1's in solid areas (e.g., rows 12-17 have clean 1's with bordering 2's), and adds global borders (2's outlining everything). However, it likely does not look fully correct based on training failures—e.g., row 10 has 2's in positions 13-16 that might be overextended capping similar to training 1 (expected might have 4's there if not adjacent to objects); row 21 has 2's around 1's that could be incorrectly capped if the object isn't narrower at bottom; row 22's 8's with 6's match hole rules but bordering in row 25 (extra 2's) might overapply like training 2. Without the input grid, can't confirm, but patterns suggest capping inconsistencies persist, missing subtle non-overextension for solid edges; account for multi-level protrusions (e.g., varying widths across heights) to fix test.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 18:04:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where connected components of 1s (solid shapes) are analyzed for holes (enclosed 4s), with holed shapes labeled as 8s, holes as 6s, solid shapes kept as 1s, and adjacent 4s (background) labeled as 2s for bordering; additionally, solid shapes with narrower tops than their maximum width get partial capping on the top row to simulate visual "hats" or edges, while untouched 4s remain background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) for shape identification and hole detection; 8-connectivity (diagonals included) leads to over-bordering, as seen in extra 2s where expected 4s remain.
 * Hole detection requires separating exterior 4s (flood-filled from grid edges using 4-connectivity) from interior holes (4s adjacent to a component but not exterior); holes must be fully enclosed, and only set to 6 if they qualify as internal voids.
 * Bordering (setting 4s to 2) should be 4-connected adjacency to 1s or 8s, not 8-way, to avoid spilling 2s into non-adjacent areas; this is applied globally after hole processing but before or independently of capping.
 * For solid (non-holed) components, capping applies only if the top row's width is less than the component's max row width; however, it must partially cap only the overhanging side edges of the top row (setting protruding 1s to 2 while keeping centered 1s), not the entire top row—current all-or-nothing logic fails this.
 * Process holed components first (set to 8 and holes to 6) to avoid interfering with solid component detection; solid components are checked for remaining 1s before capping.
 * Grid edges are always 4s unless bordered; no changes to original 1s except in capping; assume uniform grid size, no empty rows/columns.
 * Subtle: Capping uses original grid (g) for positions but output grid (out) for changes; ensure component lists reflect original 1s only; diagonals in bordering can incorrectly label distant 4s as 2 if shapes have jogs.
 * Potential miss: Multiple components may share borders, so global bordering must not over-propagate; holes adjacent but connected to exterior via diagonals should not be 6s (enforce 4-connect for all floods).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copying grid prevents side effects.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])

```
(Useful for extracting 4-connected components of 1s; DFS stack implementation is efficient and correct.)

```python
def get_row_info(component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, Dict[int, Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    if not component:
        return 0, 0, {}, 0
    row_positions = {}
    min_r = min(p[0] for p in component)
    max_r = max(p[0] for p in component)
    max_width = 0
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        cols = [p[1] for p in component if p[0] == r]
        if cols:
            min_c = min(cols)
            max_c = max(cols)
            width = max_c - min_c + 1
            row_positions[r] = (min_c, max_c, width)
            if width > max_width:
                max_width = width
    return min_r, max_r, row_positions, max_width
```
(Helpful for analyzing row widths in components to detect narrower tops for capping; provides min/max cols per row.)

    return bool(hole_positions), hole_positions
```
(Advanced and mostly correct for 4-connect hole detection via exterior flood-fill and internal flood; separates true enclosed holes from open spaces; useful but needs integration with 4-connect bordering.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identified and labeled holed components as 8s and internal 4s as 6s in all training examples where holes were present (e.g., upper-right holed shape in Train 1 and 2 matched expected 8s and 6s).
 * find_components and detect_holes worked well for Train 3 (fully correct), suggesting solid core logic for component extraction and hole detection in simpler cases.
 * Global bordering using 8-way adjacency over-labeled 4s as 2s in Train 1 (e.g., row 11 cols 14-20 set to 2s adjacent diagonally to lower 1s, but expected 4s; this created extra bordering strip on the right of the bottom-left solid component).
 * Capping logic for solid components failed in Train 1 (row 11 kept 1s at cols 10-12 but set col 13 to 2 unexpectedly, while expected partial cap: 2,1,1,1,2 followed by 4s; all-or-nothing top-row setting didn't match partial side-capping).
 * Capping also failed in Train 2 (row 22 col 4 set a central 1 to 2, making 2,2,2,2 but expected 2,2,1,2 for partial side cap on a solid component; over-capped without respecting centered projection from lower rows).
 * In Train 2, additional mismatches in lower components (e.g., row 11 had extra 1s or bordering issues? but mainly capping; unknown why some rows like 22 had isolated 1-to-2 changes without full top-row effect).
 * get_row_info is helpful but underutilized in capping—needs extension to compute per-column projections from lower rows to identify exact overhanging top positions for partial 2-setting.
 * No issues with hole processing order (holed first), but bordering after holes caused conflicts with capping in solids.
 * The program ignored diagonal connectivity in floods (correctly 4-connect) but used 8-way only for bordering, which was the main bug; Train 1 and 2 mismatches were specific to bordering overreach and capping incompleteness, while Train 3 had no such conflicts (likely no narrow tops or diagonal adjacencies).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks mostly plausible based on puzzle rules, with clear holed components (e.g., large 8-block with internal 6s around rows 3-9 cols 7-16, bordered by 2s), multiple solid components (e.g., bottom-left 1s in rows 12-20 cols 18-25 with partial 2-caps on sides), and another holed shape at bottom-right (8s with 6s in rows 21-23 cols 20-23).
 * However, it does not look fully correct without the input grid, but potential issues mirror training: possible over-bordering with 8-way (e.g., row 10 cols 13-16 are 2,2,2,2 which might be diagonal spills into what should be 4s); capping in bottom-left solid (row 12 cols 18-25: 2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2 looks partial but row 16 cols 18-25: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 might over-cap entire row instead of sides).
 * Test has extensive 2s in row 4-6 cols 5-6 (2,2,2 bordering a solid?), which seems correct for adjacency but could be over if 8-way used; lower solid in rows 16-20 cols 9-12 has 1s but surrounded by 2s/4s, looks properly bordered but capping in row 16 (2s on sides) might be incomplete if max width requires more.
 * Overall, test output makes sense for a complex grid with 2+ holed and solid shapes, but likely inherits bordering (extra 2s) and capping (partial mismatches) bugs from training, so not guaranteed correct—needs input to verify, but patterns suggest over-bordering in mid-grid 2-strips (e.g., row 10 cols 13+).

[2025-09-30 18:04:26] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on consistent patterns observed across all three training examples (interactions that occur in every case, without forcing explanations for unresolved aspects like exact red pixel counts or hole changes), the following are the key interconnected elements. These focus solely on properties (e.g., color, holes, pixels, bbox) and components (e.g., shapes) that demonstrably interact or affect each other, such as through transformations or reallocations. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., new small yellows in output 2 only, background hole changes that do not occur uniformly, semantic interpretations like "borders" without pixel/position evidence) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., precise mechanism for red pixel sizing) are noted as such.

1. **Small Yellow Components (holes=0) ↔ Color Transformation to Pink**:
   - Components: Small, disconnected yellow shapes (pixels ≤16, listed separately from large background yellow).
   - Interaction: These yellow components consistently change color to pink across all examples, while preserving bbox, holes=0, and pixels exactly.
   - Effect: No impact on other components' pixels or positions; treated as isolated transformation.
   - Consistency: Occurs in every train example (e.g., input 1: 9px and 4px → pink; input 2: 16px → pink; input 3: 2px → pink).

2. **Blue Components (holes=1) ↔ Color Transformation to Maroon**:
   - Components: Blue shapes specifically with holes=1.
   - Interaction: These blue components consistently change color to maroon across all examples, while preserving bbox, holes=1, and pixels exactly.
   - Effect: Does not alter pixels of other components but links positionally to red creation (see below); blues with holes=0 are unaffected and remain blue.
   - Consistency: Occurs in every train example (e.g., input 1: two such blues → maroon; input 2: one → maroon; input 3: one → maroon).

3. **Blue Components (holes=0) ↔ No Color Change (Remain Blue)**:
   - Components: Blue shapes specifically with holes=0.
   - Interaction: These blue components remain unchanged in color (blue), bbox, holes=0, and pixels across all examples.
   - Effect: No transformation, but links positionally to red creation (see below); distinguished from holes=1 blues by hole count.
   - Consistency: Occurs in every train example (e.g., input 1: one such blue unchanged; input 2: three unchanged; input 3: two unchanged).

4. **Blue/Maroon Components (All Original Blues, Post-Transformation) ↔ Position-Based Creation of New Red Components from Yellow Background**:
   - Components: All original blue shapes (now blue or maroon post-transformation), interacting with the large yellow background via position.
   - Interaction: New red components are consistently created in every example, with their bboxes containing or overlapping the bboxes of one or more blue/maroon components (e.g., enclosure-like positioning). Red pixels are sourced directly from the large yellow background, reducing its pixel count by exactly the total red pixels (conserving overall total pixels across all components).
   - Properties Involved: Position (bbox of reds determined by blue/maroon positions, often grouping spatially proximate ones into shared reds); pixels (yellow background → red reallocation); holes in reds vary but consistently =1 or more, possibly related to enclosed shapes (unknown exact mapping).
   - Effect: Alters yellow background pixels and introduces reds; no change to blue/maroon pixels or bboxes. Total pixels conserved (yellow decrease = red increase). No consistent hole change in background (e.g., stays 3 in input 3).
   - Consistency: Occurs in every train example (e.g., input 1: two reds enclosing three blues/maroons, 96px from yellow; input 2: two reds enclosing four blues/maroons, 142px from yellow; input 3: three reds enclosing three blues/maroons, 50px from yellow). Unknown: Exact pixel count per red (e.g., not directly tied to enclosed shape pixels in a simple 1:1 way).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 18:05:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where connected components (blobs) of 1's (likely foreground objects) are analyzed for holes within the surrounding 4's (background), and the output grid is modified to highlight borders (2's), filled blobs with holes (8's), holes themselves (6's), while preserving 1's for solid objects without holes and leaving untouched areas as 4's. The goal is to detect blob topology, add precise bordering, and differentiate solid vs. holed objects, possibly simulating a "paint" or "object enhancement" effect.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of 1's; holes are enclosed 4-regions fully surrounded by a blob (not connected to grid edges).
 * For blobs with holes: Fill the blob cells with 8, holes with 6; add borders (2's) on adjacent 4's, including horizontal gaps within rows (using 8 for internal non-edge gaps, 2 for top/bottom), vertical borders on left/right if adjacent to 4's, and extended top/bottom border rows covering the blob's row projection plus one cell overhang.
 * For solid blobs (no holes): Keep 1's intact, but add borders (2's) on adjacent 4's, including per-row left/right borders, and top/bottom border rows with overhang; if the top row of the blob is narrower than the max width, fill that row's blob cells with 2's (treating it as a "cap").
 * Gaps in rows: For holed blobs, fill left/right gaps with 2 if top/bottom row, else 8; ensure global min/max columns are used for alignment.
 * Border placement: Only overwrite 4's with 2's; extend top/bottom borders to cover the row's min/max cols ±1; vertical borders only if directly adjacent and on 4's.
 * Hole detection: Use flood-fill from edges to mark reachable 4's, then any 4's adjacent to blob but unreachable are holes (mark with 6); single-cell or trivial components have no holes.
 * Subtleties: Overhang in top/bottom borders (±1 col); for solid blobs, top-row "cap" with 2's only if narrower; preserve 1's in solid blobs but border them; handle multi-row/multi-col components correctly without over-bordering; in train1, lower solid blobs need precise bordering without filling internals; in train2, complex shapes require accurate gap filling and border alignment across irregular widths.
 * Edge cases: Blobs touching grid edges (no external border there); disconnected holes; blobs with internal 4's that are not fully enclosed (not holes); components with varying row widths; solid blobs spanning full width (no side borders).
 * All attempts must copy the input grid and only modify 4's or 1's as specified; untouched areas remain 4's; 1's become 8 only if holed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copies grid to avoid mutating input; essential for all processing.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS stack to find 4-connected components of 1's, marking visited.
    # Returns list of components, each a list of (row, col) positions.
    # Helpful: Correctly identifies blobs; used in all attempts.
```
(Reliable for extracting connected 1's; no issues observed.)

```python
def get_row_info(component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, Dict[int, Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    # Computes min_r, max_r, per-row dict of (min_col, max_col, width), and global max_width.
    # Helpful: Essential for handling row-wise gaps and borders in irregular blobs.
```
(Useful for gap filling and border extension; accurate in current attempt.)

```python
def detect_holes(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[bool, set]:
    # Temporarily marks blob as 3's; flood-fills from edges to mark reachable 4's.
    # Then, for 4's adjacent to blob, flood-fills unreachable ones as holes (returns bool has_hole and set of hole positions).
    # Helpful: Correctly distinguishes enclosed holes; used successfully in train3.
```
(Key for hole detection; works well but may need tuning for adjacency in complex shapes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; train1 INCORRECT: Generated overfills row 6 with 8's in left section (e.g., positions 2-7 as 8's instead of 2's in a solid-like top cap), row 7 starts borders too early (2's from col 2 instead of col 5), and row 8 has extra 2's in left (cols 5-10) vs expected starting later; lower solid blob in row 11 has incomplete right borders (only up to col 4 as 2's, missing extension to col 9); unknown why gap filling misaligns with global min/max cols.
 * Train2 INCORRECT: Generated fills unintended areas, e.g., row 1 has extra 2's in cols 10-21 where expected has 8's and 2's differently; row 2 has 1's preserved but borders misaligned (e.g., col 11 as 8 instead of 2); lower sections like row 18 have 4's where expected has 2's in borders, and row 23 has 1's in col 4 misplaced (expected 2's); side borders and top caps not overhanging correctly, leading to missing 2's in irregular shapes.
 * Train3 CORRECT: All blob detections, hole fillings (6's), 8's, and borders (2's with proper overhangs and gaps) match expected, indicating core logic works for simpler or aligned cases.
 * find_components and get_row_info are essential and accurate; detect_holes works but may over/under-detect adjacency in train1/2 due to temp marking or flood-fill starting points.
 * Gaps in holed blobs not using correct color (2 vs 8) for non-top/bottom rows in train1.
 * Solid blob top-cap logic (filling with 2's if narrower) applied incorrectly in train1 (overfills).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though detect_holes could be refined for better adj4 collection.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks partially correct but likely incorrect overall, as it applies holed-blob logic (8's and 6's in upper right blob) and solid bordering (2's around lower blobs) sensibly, but inconsistencies suggest issues: e.g., upper blob's bottom rows (e.g., row 9-11) have 8's extending to col 16 as 4 instead of bordered 2's or filled; lower left solid blob in rows 12-17 has 1's preserved but borders missing overhang (e.g., row 12 col 18-24 should extend 2's further?); small blob in rows 17-20 has borders but row 17 col 6-12 as 1's without side 2's adjacent to 4's; right lower holed blob (rows 21-24) has 6's correctly but top border row 20 has 2's not overhanging left of min col; overall, borders seem under-extended in places (no ±1 col overhang consistently), and some 4's adjacent to solids remain unbordered (e.g., row 14 cols 7-16), which mismatches rules from training expects; without expected, it "makes sense" for hole detection but fails precise bordering like in train1/2 errors—likely needs better global min/max per component and conditional overhang.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-processing puzzle where the input grid contains background (4), solid object pixels (1), and possibly other markers, and the goal is to identify connected components of objects, detect enclosed holes (isolated 4's within components), modify holed components by marking them as filled/special (8) with holes as interior (6), cap narrower top/bottom edges of solid (no-hole) components with borders (2) without overextending, and finally apply global bordering to background pixels adjacent to modified objects. The output transforms the grid to highlight object structures, holes, and edges while preserving untouched areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) for objects (1's); use DFS or BFS (e.g., stack or queue) to find them without visiting already-processed cells.
 * Hole detection requires flood-filling from grid borders to mark exterior background (4's connected to edges) separately (e.g., as 5 temporarily), then identifying any unmarked 4's fully enclosed within a component's boundary as holes—these must be isolated from the outer world but adjacent to the component.
 * For components with holes: Entire component becomes 8 (indicating holed/filled object), and detected holes become 6 (interior voids); do not apply capping to these.
 * For solid components (no holes): Only cap the top (min row) and bottom (max row) if their width is less than the component's global max width—set the narrower row's object pixels to 2 (edge cap), and optionally extend 2 to immediate adjacent 4's in the same row on left/right if they exist, but do not overextend or alter non-narrow rows; avoid turning solid 1's into 2's prematurely or capping non-edge rows.
 * Global bordering: After all modifications, scan all remaining 4's and set to 2 if 8-directionally adjacent to any 1 or 8 (but not to 2 or 6, to avoid over-bordering); this creates outlines around objects but skips pure interiors or already-capped areas.
 * Subtleties: Components may span multiple rows/columns irregularly (e.g., protrusions or L-shapes), so row-width calculation must use min/max cols per row accurately; holes can be multi-cell and must be fully flood-filled per enclosed region; do not treat exterior 4's as holes; solid object protrusions (e.g., thin bars) should retain 1's in the middle unless truly narrower edges; background remains 4 unless bordered; grid edges are implicit borders for flood-fill; assume uniform grid dimensions and no diagonal connections for components/holes unless specified.
 * Edge cases: Empty components, single-cell objects (no capping needed), objects touching grid borders (affects hole detection), multiple components per grid, holes touching component edges but not exterior, solid objects with varying widths where only true top/bottom get capped; avoid modifying 1's to 2/8 unless rules apply; preserve original 1's in solid non-capped areas.

    # Computes min_r, max_r, row_dict (per-row min_c, max_c, width), and max_width across component.
    # Useful for identifying top/bottom rows and checking if they need capping (width < max_width).
```
(Key for solid object capping logic; handles irregular shapes by per-row analysis.)

```python
def detect_holes(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[bool, set]:
    # Temporarily marks component as 3, flood-fills border-connected 4's as 5 (exterior).
    # Then flood-fills unmarked 4's adjacent to component as holes, returning has_hole flag and set of hole positions.
    # Critical for distinguishing enclosed vs. exterior background; uses two separate BFS/queues.
```
(Essential for hole detection; correctly handles multi-cell holes but requires careful adjacency checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly identifies components and detects holes (e.g., sets 8 for holed objects and 6 for interiors, as seen in training 1 rows 2-7 and test output rows 2-10), and applies global bordering appropriately in many cases (e.g., 2's outlining objects without overfill).
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated overextended capping on the bottom solid horizontal bar—row 10 has extra 2's to the right of the 1's (positions ~14-19 as 2 instead of 4), and row 11 has 1's incorrectly surrounded by extended 2's (e.g., positions 14-19 as 2,2,2,2,2,2 instead of 4's); also row 7 has 2's in positions where expected has 8's uncapped. This suggests capping logic applies 2's too broadly, turning adjacent 4's into 2's beyond the narrower row or altering solid 1's; unknown why row 11's 1's are flanked by extra 2's instead of minimal bordering.
 * Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Similar capping errors on solid protrusions—row 7 generated all 2's across what should be a solid 1-row object (positions 1-5 as 2,2,2,2,2 instead of 1,1,1,1,1), and row 8 has extra 1's turned to 2's (position 0 as 2 instead of expected partial); bottom section (rows 22-25) has mismatched 1's and 2's in protrusions (e.g., row 23 generated 2,1,1,2 but expected 2,2,1,2 or similar shifts); row 7 also misses retaining 1's in the middle of solid bars. Hole detection worked (8's and 6's match), but global bordering over-applied in solid areas.
 * Training example 3 (CORRECT): All modifications matched expected, implying the logic handles that specific case (likely a mix of holed/solid without capping issues) perfectly—no differences noted.
 * Function `add_global_borders` is helpful but subtly broken: It uses 8-directions correctly for adjacency to 1/8, but in combination with capping, it causes over-bordering of 4's near capped 2's; consider running it only after all other changes and excluding adjacency to 2's.
 * Overall, hole detection and component finding are solid (worked in all), but capping for solid objects fails by overextending 2's into adjacent 4's beyond the row or prematurely converting 1's to 2's; no unhelpful functions, but `detect_holes` temp-marking (to 3/5) is essential and correct—avoid simplifying it.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly detects and marks a large holed object (8's in rows 2-10 with 6's inside, e.g., row 3 positions ~13-15 as 6), applies minimal capping to solid protrusions (e.g., row 11 has 2's around a small 1-group without overextension), retains 1's in solid areas (e.g., rows 12-17 have clean 1's with bordering 2's), and adds global borders (2's outlining everything). However, it likely does not look fully correct based on training failures—e.g., row 10 has 2's in positions 13-16 that might be overextended capping similar to training 1 (expected might have 4's there if not adjacent to objects); row 21 has 2's around 1's that could be incorrectly capped if the object isn't narrower at bottom; row 22's 8's with 6's match hole rules but bordering in row 25 (extra 2's) might overapply like training 2. Without the input grid, can't confirm, but patterns suggest capping inconsistencies persist, missing subtle non-overextension for solid edges; account for multi-level protrusions (e.g., varying widths across heights) to fix test.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where connected components of 1s (solid shapes) are analyzed for holes (enclosed 4s), with holed shapes labeled as 8s, holes as 6s, solid shapes kept as 1s, and adjacent 4s (background) labeled as 2s for bordering; additionally, solid shapes with narrower tops than their maximum width get partial capping on the top row to simulate visual "hats" or edges, while untouched 4s remain background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) for shape identification and hole detection; 8-connectivity (diagonals included) leads to over-bordering, as seen in extra 2s where expected 4s remain.
 * Hole detection requires separating exterior 4s (flood-filled from grid edges using 4-connectivity) from interior holes (4s adjacent to a component but not exterior); holes must be fully enclosed, and only set to 6 if they qualify as internal voids.
 * Bordering (setting 4s to 2) should be 4-connected adjacency to 1s or 8s, not 8-way, to avoid spilling 2s into non-adjacent areas; this is applied globally after hole processing but before or independently of capping.
 * For solid (non-holed) components, capping applies only if the top row's width is less than the component's max row width; however, it must partially cap only the overhanging side edges of the top row (setting protruding 1s to 2 while keeping centered 1s), not the entire top row—current all-or-nothing logic fails this.
 * Process holed components first (set to 8 and holes to 6) to avoid interfering with solid component detection; solid components are checked for remaining 1s before capping.
 * Grid edges are always 4s unless bordered; no changes to original 1s except in capping; assume uniform grid size, no empty rows/columns.
 * Subtle: Capping uses original grid (g) for positions but output grid (out) for changes; ensure component lists reflect original 1s only; diagonals in bordering can incorrectly label distant 4s as 2 if shapes have jogs.
 * Potential miss: Multiple components may share borders, so global bordering must not over-propagate; holes adjacent but connected to exterior via diagonals should not be 6s (enforce 4-connect for all floods).

(Useful for extracting 4-connected components of 1s; DFS stack implementation is efficient and correct.)

        cols = [p[1] for p in component if p[0] == r]
        if cols:
            min_c = min(cols)
            max_c = max(cols)
            width = max_c - min_c + 1

            if width > max_width:
                max_width = width
    return min_r, max_r, row_positions, max_width
```
(Helpful for analyzing row widths in components to detect narrower tops for capping; provides min/max cols per row.)

```
(Advanced and mostly correct for 4-connect hole detection via exterior flood-fill and internal flood; separates true enclosed holes from open spaces; useful but needs integration with 4-connect bordering.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identified and labeled holed components as 8s and internal 4s as 6s in all training examples where holes were present (e.g., upper-right holed shape in Train 1 and 2 matched expected 8s and 6s).
 * find_components and detect_holes worked well for Train 3 (fully correct), suggesting solid core logic for component extraction and hole detection in simpler cases.
 * Global bordering using 8-way adjacency over-labeled 4s as 2s in Train 1 (e.g., row 11 cols 14-20 set to 2s adjacent diagonally to lower 1s, but expected 4s; this created extra bordering strip on the right of the bottom-left solid component).
 * Capping logic for solid components failed in Train 1 (row 11 kept 1s at cols 10-12 but set col 13 to 2 unexpectedly, while expected partial cap: 2,1,1,1,2 followed by 4s; all-or-nothing top-row setting didn't match partial side-capping).
 * Capping also failed in Train 2 (row 22 col 4 set a central 1 to 2, making 2,2,2,2 but expected 2,2,1,2 for partial side cap on a solid component; over-capped without respecting centered projection from lower rows).
 * In Train 2, additional mismatches in lower components (e.g., row 11 had extra 1s or bordering issues? but mainly capping; unknown why some rows like 22 had isolated 1-to-2 changes without full top-row effect).
 * get_row_info is helpful but underutilized in capping—needs extension to compute per-column projections from lower rows to identify exact overhanging top positions for partial 2-setting.
 * No issues with hole processing order (holed first), but bordering after holes caused conflicts with capping in solids.
 * The program ignored diagonal connectivity in floods (correctly 4-connect) but used 8-way only for bordering, which was the main bug; Train 1 and 2 mismatches were specific to bordering overreach and capping incompleteness, while Train 3 had no such conflicts (likely no narrow tops or diagonal adjacencies).

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks mostly plausible based on puzzle rules, with clear holed components (e.g., large 8-block with internal 6s around rows 3-9 cols 7-16, bordered by 2s), multiple solid components (e.g., bottom-left 1s in rows 12-20 cols 18-25 with partial 2-caps on sides), and another holed shape at bottom-right (8s with 6s in rows 21-23 cols 20-23).
 * However, it does not look fully correct without the input grid, but potential issues mirror training: possible over-bordering with 8-way (e.g., row 10 cols 13-16 are 2,2,2,2 which might be diagonal spills into what should be 4s); capping in bottom-left solid (row 12 cols 18-25: 2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2 looks partial but row 16 cols 18-25: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 might over-cap entire row instead of sides).
 * Test has extensive 2s in row 4-6 cols 5-6 (2,2,2 bordering a solid?), which seems correct for adjacency but could be over if 8-way used; lower solid in rows 16-20 cols 9-12 has 1s but surrounded by 2s/4s, looks properly bordered but capping in row 16 (2s on sides) might be incomplete if max width requires more.
 * Overall, test output makes sense for a complex grid with 2+ holed and solid shapes, but likely inherits bordering (extra 2s) and capping (partial mismatches) bugs from training, so not guaranteed correct—needs input to verify, but patterns suggest over-bordering in mid-grid 2-strips (e.g., row 10 cols 13+).

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on consistent patterns observed across all three training examples (interactions that occur in every case, without forcing explanations for unresolved aspects like exact red pixel counts or hole changes), the following are the key interconnected elements. These focus solely on properties (e.g., color, holes, pixels, bbox) and components (e.g., shapes) that demonstrably interact or affect each other, such as through transformations or reallocations. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., new small yellows in output 2 only, background hole changes that do not occur uniformly, semantic interpretations like "borders" without pixel/position evidence) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., precise mechanism for red pixel sizing) are noted as such.

1. **Small Yellow Components (holes=0) ↔ Color Transformation to Pink**:
   - Components: Small, disconnected yellow shapes (pixels ≤16, listed separately from large background yellow).
   - Interaction: These yellow components consistently change color to pink across all examples, while preserving bbox, holes=0, and pixels exactly.
   - Effect: No impact on other components' pixels or positions; treated as isolated transformation.
   - Consistency: Occurs in every train example (e.g., input 1: 9px and 4px → pink; input 2: 16px → pink; input 3: 2px → pink).

2. **Blue Components (holes=1) ↔ Color Transformation to Maroon**:
   - Components: Blue shapes specifically with holes=1.
   - Interaction: These blue components consistently change color to maroon across all examples, while preserving bbox, holes=1, and pixels exactly.
   - Effect: Does not alter pixels of other components but links positionally to red creation (see below); blues with holes=0 are unaffected and remain blue.
   - Consistency: Occurs in every train example (e.g., input 1: two such blues → maroon; input 2: one → maroon; input 3: one → maroon).

3. **Blue Components (holes=0) ↔ No Color Change (Remain Blue)**:
   - Components: Blue shapes specifically with holes=0.
   - Interaction: These blue components remain unchanged in color (blue), bbox, holes=0, and pixels across all examples.
   - Effect: No transformation, but links positionally to red creation (see below); distinguished from holes=1 blues by hole count.
   - Consistency: Occurs in every train example (e.g., input 1: one such blue unchanged; input 2: three unchanged; input 3: two unchanged).

4. **Blue/Maroon Components (All Original Blues, Post-Transformation) ↔ Position-Based Creation of New Red Components from Yellow Background**:
   - Components: All original blue shapes (now blue or maroon post-transformation), interacting with the large yellow background via position.
   - Interaction: New red components are consistently created in every example, with their bboxes containing or overlapping the bboxes of one or more blue/maroon components (e.g., enclosure-like positioning). Red pixels are sourced directly from the large yellow background, reducing its pixel count by exactly the total red pixels (conserving overall total pixels across all components).
   - Properties Involved: Position (bbox of reds determined by blue/maroon positions, often grouping spatially proximate ones into shared reds); pixels (yellow background → red reallocation); holes in reds vary but consistently =1 or more, possibly related to enclosed shapes (unknown exact mapping).
   - Effect: Alters yellow background pixels and introduces reds; no change to blue/maroon pixels or bboxes. Total pixels conserved (yellow decrease = red increase). No consistent hole change in background (e.g., stays 3 in input 3).
   - Consistency: Occurs in every train example (e.g., input 1: two reds enclosing three blues/maroons, 96px from yellow; input 2: two reds enclosing four blues/maroons, 142px from yellow; input 3: three reds enclosing three blues/maroons, 50px from yellow). Unknown: Exact pixel count per red (e.g., not directly tied to enclosed shape pixels in a simple 1:1 way).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 18:09:57] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle processing a grid of numbers (primarily 1s for object components, 4s for background/empty space) to detect enclosed "holes" (isolated regions of 4s surrounded by 1s), marking enclosing components as 8, the holes themselves as 6, and background 4s adjacent (in 8-connectivity) to marked components or original 1s as 2, while leaving other 4s unchanged and preserving non-enclosing 1s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components of 1s are identified using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right only), ignoring diagonals for object grouping.
 * Holes are regions of 4s that are fully enclosed by a component (no path to the grid edge via 4s), detected via flood fill: first mark all exterior-reachable 4s starting from grid edges (using 4-connectivity to avoid diagonal leaks), then identify any remaining 4s adjacent (4-connect) to the component as potential hole starts, and flood fill those to find enclosed areas.
 * Only components that enclose at least one hole get marked as 8; non-enclosing 1s remain 1.
 * Hole marking uses 6 only for the enclosed 4s directly associated with a specific component (per-component detection).
 * Bordering (marking 4s as 2) is done separately after hole detection, using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) to check adjacency to any 1 or 8, which can cause more expansive bordering than the component connectivity itself.
 * Grid edges are treated specially for exterior flood fill (start from border 4s to mark all open background).
 * Subtlety: Ensure hole detection excludes the component itself (1s block flood) and doesn't mark exterior 4s as holes; also, multiple holes per component should all be captured if adjacent via 4s.
 * Subtlety: 8-connect for bordering can mark 4s as 2 even if not 4-adjacent to the component, potentially creating wider "frames" around objects.
 * Non-1/4 cells (if any) are ignored/unmentioned, but assume grid is only 1s and 4s.
 * Components must be fully processed independently; overlapping or adjacent components don't merge unless 4-connected.
 * Potential miss: If a hole is only diagonally enclosed (not 4-connect blocked), it might leak in detection—4-connect for holes ensures strict enclosure.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid, single-cell components, components touching edges (no holes possible), or holes touching other components.

(Core function for per-component hole detection via exterior flood fill and inner flood fill; handles enclosure correctly with 4-connect.)

(The main `program` function orchestrates components, hole detection, marking 8/6, and final 8-connect bordering to 2; helpful but builds on the above.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the provided single attempt; it successfully handled all three training examples correctly, indicating solid base logic for component detection, hole enclosure, and bordering.
 * Worked: 4-connect for components and holes correctly groups objects and detects strict enclosures without diagonal leaks.
 * Worked: Exterior flood fill from edges accurately separates open background from enclosed holes.
 * Worked: Per-component processing ensures only hole-enclosing 1s become 8, while non-enclosing stay 1.
 * Worked: 8-connect bordering expands 2s appropriately around marked areas.
 * Did not work (potential issue): In complex grids with multiple components, hole flood fill might over- or under-mark if adj_starts miss diagonal-only enclosures (but 4-connect seems intentional).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (copy_grid, find_components, detect_holes, main program) are relevant and functional—no broken ones to avoid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output looks mostly correct and makes sense overall: It identifies at least two main hole-enclosing components (one large irregular blob of 8s in the upper-middle with internal 6s at positions like row 3 cols 13-15, and a smaller one in the bottom at row 21 cols 21-23 with 6s), marks non-enclosing 1s (e.g., small cluster at rows 10-17 cols 19-26) as remaining 1s, and applies 2s for bordering 4s around these (e.g., wide 2 frames in rows 1-9 cols 7-17, and bottom rows 20-24 cols 19-25).
 * Generated effects: Upper component correctly marked 8 with a clear hole of three 6s; bottom enclosure similarly marked with two 6s inside 8s; bordering 2s use 8-connect to fill diagonal-adjacent areas, creating clean frames without over-marking interiors.
 * Differences from expected: Without the exact expected output, it's hard to confirm 100%, but one potential subtlety is if the small 1s cluster at bottom (rows 15-21 cols 19-26) should be treated as enclosing something—it's marked as 1s with surrounding 2s, but no 8/6, suggesting no detected hole, which seems correct as it's open to edges; another is the isolated 2s in row 10 cols 13-17, which might be bordering remnants—looks appropriate but could be over-bordering if 8-connect catches non-intended diagonals (unknown if that's a mismatch).
 * Overall, the output aligns with rules: enclosures are marked, borders are expanded, and open areas stay 4; no obvious errors like marking exterior as 6 or missing a clear hole.
