=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 13:18:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 13:33:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where connected components of barriers (1's) in a background of empty space (4's) need to be identified, with enclosed "holes" (isolated 4's) detected per component. Simple components (no holes) are filled with 1's and bordered with 2's, while complex components (with holes) are filled with 8's, holes with 6's, and bordered with 2's, with special handling for small linear holes to match training patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of 1's, found via BFS or DFS.
 * Hole detection must be per-component: treat only the current component as barriers (set to 1), initialize the rest of the grid to passable 4's, then flood-fill from border 4's to mark reachable background; unreachable 4's are holes enclosed by this component alone (global barriers from other components should not block flood for this detection).
 * Simple components (zero holes) use 1 for fill and 2 for 8-directional borders on adjacent 4's.
 * Complex components use 8 for the component fill, 6 for holes, and 2 for borders; however, small 1-row horizontal holes (≤2 cells wide) should be treated as part of the component (set to 8) with the row below in those columns set to 6 if it's component cells, to match thin enclosure patterns in training.
 * Borders are 8-directional (including diagonals) and only applied to adjacent 4's, turning them to 2's.
 * Grids are rectangular, with borders always 4's; components touching borders may have partial bordering.
 * Subtlety: False hole detection occurs if other components' 1's are treated as barriers during flood-fill, leading to simple components wrongly classified as complex (e.g., inheriting global holes).
 * Another subtlety: In some cases (e.g., train 2), certain enclosed areas are filled with 1's instead of 8/6, suggesting they are treated as "simple" despite apparent enclosure, possibly if the "hole" is not fully isolated or is part of a larger non-enclosing structure.
 * Ensure no overwriting of existing colors; process components independently but apply changes cumulatively to a copy of the input grid.
 * Background remains 4 unless bordered; no coloring of non-adjacent areas.
 * Potential miss: Vertical thin holes may not need special treatment like horizontal ones, based on training asymmetry.

def handle_simple_component(grid: List[List[int]], component: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
    # Fills simple (no-hole) components with 1's and adds borders; modifies grid in place.
    # Straightforward and matches expected for non-enclosing shapes.
    for r, c in component:
        grid[r][c] = 1
    add_border(grid, component)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies connected components and attempts per-component processing, but fails all training examples due to a critical bug in hole detection: `detect_holes` copies the full input grid (with all 1's as barriers) and only redundantly sets the current component to 1, resulting in global flood-fill that detects holes from all components combined; this causes simple components to falsely inherit holes from complex ones elsewhere, leading to wrong classification (e.g., setting 8's/6's instead of 1's/2's).
 * In train 1, generated output incorrectly uses 8's for the bottom simple horizontal/vertical bars (rows ~10-17, cols ~9-13 and longer in row 12), where expected uses 1's with 2 borders; also, the right complex shape has correct 8/6 structure but the special small-hole handling doesn't trigger properly, leaving extra 6's or mismatches in row 4-5 cols ~7-9; upper left simple shapes are correctly 1/2 but overall fails due to bottom error.
 * In train 2, generated uses 8's for multiple simple areas that should be 1's (e.g., rows 2-7 cols 0-8 expected 1's but generated 8's; row 10-11 cols 3-9 expected 1's but generated 8's; row 22-25 has mismatches in thin structures); complex areas like row 14-16 cols 13-18 have 6's matching expected, but global hole detection pollutes simple ones; no special handling for vertical 1's in row 22 col 4.
 * In train 3, generated incorrectly sets upper simple vertical bar (rows 3-6 cols 2-6) to 8's where expected 1's; lower complex shape (rows 12-16 cols 3-10) has 6's in row 14 cols 5-6 matching expected, but upper error due to false holes; special 1-row hole case in lower doesn't fully align (generated has extra 8's in row 6 col 12? but lists show minor col shifts); also, disconnected small shapes in rows 6-7 cols 11-13 expected 1's/2's but may have 8's.
 * `detect_holes` is broken/not helpful in current form (global barriers cause false positives; needs per-component isolation by setting temp to all 4's then only current comp to 1 before flooding from border 4's).
 * `handle_complex_component` is partially helpful but over-applies 8/6 without fixing detection; special case for 1-row holes (≤2 cols) is a good intuition for train 3 but triggers wrongly due to bug and doesn't handle all thin cases (e.g., vertical in train 2).
 * Overall, component isolation and bordering work, but hole-specific logic fails; no unhelpful functions beyond the buggy `detect_holes`.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same bug as training (global hole detection), likely over-applying 8's/6's to simple components (e.g., rows 9-12 show 8's in what appear to be non-enclosing bars cols 3-12; row 10 has 2's in cols 13-19 suggesting false bordering; row 22 has 8's/6's in cols 20-24 where thin structure may be simple 1's like train 2); complex areas like row 3-6 cols 8-16 have 6's that might be valid, but without expected, it's suspect—e.g., row 21-22 cols 19-25 look like a simple enclosure but get 8/6, possibly wrongly; borders (2's) are applied but may overreach due to false complexity; overall, it doesn't make sense for a correct solution as simple shapes (e.g., left side verticals) get 8's instead of 1's.

[2025-10-02 13:33:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 13:53:18] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components of filled pixels (1's, representing object shapes) are identified, internal holes (enclosed background 4's) are detected and handled differently based on size, and the output grid is modified by filling shapes with specific values (e.g., 8 for interiors, 6 for larger holes), adding borders (2's) around components, and leaving solid (no-hole) components as 1's while enhancing their borders. The goal is to transform the input grid into a stylized or labeled version that distinguishes filled regions, holes, and boundaries without altering background 4's except where they form borders or small hole adjustments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components of 1's must be found using 4-directional BFS or DFS, treating only adjacent 1's as part of the same object; isolated 1's or separate blobs are processed independently.
 * Background (4's) must be distinguished between external (connected to the grid's outer edges or adjacent to components but reachable from outside) and internal holes (enclosed 4's fully surrounded by a component, not reachable from external background); this requires flood-filling from component-adjacent 4's to mark external background, then identifying remaining unmarked 4's inside the component's bounding box as holes.
 * Holes are processed by size: small holes (<3 cells) are filled with 8 but may have adjacent cells below set to 6 (possibly to simulate shading or connection); larger holes (>=3 cells) are uniformly filled with 6.
 * For components with holes (filled components), the entire 1's area is overwritten with 8's; for solid components (no holes), 1's are left unchanged, but borders are added.
 * Borders (2's) are added around components: top row of component gets 2's extended left/right by 1 cell; bottom row gets 2's below if height <=5, or fills bottom row itself if taller; left/right columns get 2's in adjacent columns if they are 4's; all adjacent 4's to the component are set to 2's; for protrusions (e.g., horizontal segments >1 in a row with gaps), rightmost cells may get special 2's.
 * Subtle elements: Bounding box for hole detection should expand by 1 cell around the component to catch enclosed areas; avoid over-filling borders into other components; small hole handling seems to involve vertical adjustments (e.g., setting cells below 8's to 6 if adjacent); protrusions are detected per row by segmenting consecutive columns and marking right ends of long segments (>=3) with 2's; solid components still need top/bottom/left/right border additions, but bottom handling varies by height (e.g., if height >5, fill bottom row with 2's instead of below).
 * General: Output starts as a copy of input; only modify where necessary; ensure no leakage between components (e.g., shared borders); the grid may have multiple components, some with holes (fill to 8/6), some solid (keep 1's + borders); background 4's remain unless bordering a component.
 * Easy-to-miss: External background flood-fill must start only from 4's directly adjacent to the component (not from edges of grid unless connected); hole detection iterates only in expanded bounding box to efficiency but must mark all connected hole cells; in filled components, top border is always on the component's top row (overwriting 8's? but expected shows 2's there in some cases); adjacent 4's are set to 2's after other processing to catch any misses.

These functions are helpful for component extraction, external background marking, and hole detection, as they correctly implement flood-fills and bounding-box logic. They form the core of processing each component.

 * `handle_small_hole`: Attempts to fill small holes with 8 and set below to 6, but in practice leads to incorrect vertical adjustments (e.g., overwrites non-hole areas or misses expected 6 placements); it's overly simplistic and doesn't match expected small hole patterns, which may require more nuanced adjacency checks—avoid or heavily revise.
 * `handle_protrusions`: Tries to detect horizontal segments in rows and mark right ends with 2's for long protrusions (>=3 cells), but fails to correctly identify segments (e.g., merges unrelated parts or misses gaps), leading to extra or missing 2's; broken for complex shapes with multiple rows—don't use as-is.
 * `process_solid_component`: Adds borders but varies bottom handling by height (>5 fills bottom row with 2's, else below), which partially works for borders but misses consistent adjacent 4's to 2's and doesn't handle all cases (e.g., top border only if above is 4); incomplete but salvageable.
 * `process_filled_component`: Fills with 8's and handles holes, but order of operations is wrong (e.g., top border overwrites 8's to 2's incorrectly, protrusions after filling mess up interiors, adjacent 4's set too late); also, small hole handling calls the broken function. The left/right border addition only checks if 4 and sets to 2, but may overwrite other things—problematic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core bugs in hole detection and filling logic prevent proper 8/6 placement.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps 1's in the large left component (e.g., row 3: 2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2 instead of expected 2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2) and has extra/misplaced 2's (e.g., row 11 has extra 2's in 2,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2 instead of 2,1,1,1,2); no 8's or 6's appear in the hole, suggesting hole detection failed (treated as solid, no filling); borders overextended (e.g., bottom row 7 has extra 2's); unknown why filling skipped, possibly bounding box too tight or external flood-fill marked the hole as external.
 * Train 2: Generated retains 1's in filled areas (e.g., row 2: 2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2 instead of expected with 8's) and has incorrect 2's (e.g., row 1 has 2,2,2,...2,2,2,2 instead of sparser 2's; row 7 has 2,1,1,1,1,2 instead of 2,8,8,8,8,8,...); no 6's in the large hole (row 3: 2,1,1,... instead of 2,8,8,... with 6's); protrusions mishandled (extra 2's in row 6); likely same hole detection failure, plus border logic adds 2's inside components.
 * Train 3: Generated leaves 1's in both potential filled areas (e.g., row 13: 2,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,2 instead of expected 2,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2 with hole 6's; bottom shape row 12: 2,1,1,1,1,1,2 instead of 2,8,8,8,8,8,2); borders correct in some places (e.g., top 2's in row 3) but missing extensions (e.g., no 2's around bottom shape properly); no 8's at all, indicating process_filled never triggered—hole detection broken, possibly because get_holes bounding box misses enclosed 4's or external flood-fill over-marks.
 * Overall: Hole detection (get_holes) is essential but failing (no 8/6 outputs), leading to all components treated as solid (1's unchanged); border additions (2's) partially work for tops/lefts but overdo bottoms/protrusions; small hole handling untested but suspicious; component finding seems okay (shapes outlined) but filling conditional (if holes) never true; adjacent 4's to 2's is a good idea but applied too broadly/late; no attempts handled height-based bottom borders correctly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and follows the same failure pattern as training examples: it retains 1's throughout all components (e.g., row 3: 2,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,2 instead of likely 8's filling shapes; row 6: 2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2 with no 8's or 6's for probable holes/protrusions), indicating hole detection failed again, treating everything as solid. Borders (2's) are added inconsistently (e.g., row 2 has long 2's but row 10 has 2,1,1,...1,2 with internal 1's; row 21 has 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 but likely overextended). No 8's or 6's appear anywhere, so interiors aren't filled, and small/large hole distinctions are ignored; this doesn't make sense for a puzzle expecting stylized shapes with shaded holes (based on training expecteds), as the output looks like a half-processed border sketch rather than a complete labeling—probably needs better external flood-fill starting points and bounding box expansion to detect enclosures properly.

[2025-10-02 13:53:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components of filled pixels (1's, representing object shapes) are identified, internal holes (enclosed background 4's) are detected and handled differently based on size, and the output grid is modified by filling shapes with specific values (e.g., 8 for interiors, 6 for larger holes), adding borders (2's) around components, and leaving solid (no-hole) components as 1's while enhancing their borders. The goal is to transform the input grid into a stylized or labeled version that distinguishes filled regions, holes, and boundaries without altering background 4's except where they form borders or small hole adjustments.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components of 1's must be found using 4-directional BFS or DFS, treating only adjacent 1's as part of the same object; isolated 1's or separate blobs are processed independently.
 * Background (4's) must be distinguished between external (connected to the grid's outer edges or adjacent to components but reachable from outside) and internal holes (enclosed 4's fully surrounded by a component, not reachable from external background); this requires flood-filling from component-adjacent 4's to mark external background, then identifying remaining unmarked 4's inside the component's bounding box as holes.
 * Holes are processed by size: small holes (<3 cells) are filled with 8 but may have adjacent cells below set to 6 (possibly to simulate shading or connection); larger holes (>=3 cells) are uniformly filled with 6.
 * For components with holes (filled components), the entire 1's area is overwritten with 8's; for solid components (no holes), 1's are left unchanged, but borders are added.
 * Borders (2's) are added around components: top row of component gets 2's extended left/right by 1 cell; bottom row gets 2's below if height <=5, or fills bottom row itself if taller; left/right columns get 2's in adjacent columns if they are 4's; all adjacent 4's to the component are set to 2's; for protrusions (e.g., horizontal segments >1 in a row with gaps), rightmost cells may get special 2's.
 * Subtle elements: Bounding box for hole detection should expand by 1 cell around the component to catch enclosed areas; avoid over-filling borders into other components; small hole handling seems to involve vertical adjustments (e.g., setting cells below 8's to 6 if adjacent); protrusions are detected per row by segmenting consecutive columns and marking right ends of long segments (>=3) with 2's; solid components still need top/bottom/left/right border additions, but bottom handling varies by height (e.g., if height >5, fill bottom row with 2's instead of below).
 * General: Output starts as a copy of input; only modify where necessary; ensure no leakage between components (e.g., shared borders); the grid may have multiple components, some with holes (fill to 8/6), some solid (keep 1's + borders); background 4's remain unless bordering a component.
 * Easy-to-miss: External background flood-fill must start only from 4's directly adjacent to the component (not from edges of grid unless connected); hole detection iterates only in expanded bounding box to efficiency but must mark all connected hole cells; in filled components, top border is always on the component's top row (overwriting 8's? but expected shows 2's there in some cases); adjacent 4's are set to 2's after other processing to catch any misses.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where connected components of barriers (1's) in a background of empty space (4's) need to be identified, with enclosed "holes" (isolated 4's) detected per component. Simple components (no holes) are filled with 1's and bordered with 2's, while complex components (with holes) are filled with 8's, holes with 6's, and bordered with 2's, with special handling for small linear holes to match training patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of 1's, found via BFS or DFS.
 * Hole detection must be per-component: treat only the current component as barriers (set to 1), initialize the rest of the grid to passable 4's, then flood-fill from border 4's to mark reachable background; unreachable 4's are holes enclosed by this component alone (global barriers from other components should not block flood for this detection).
 * Simple components (zero holes) use 1 for fill and 2 for 8-directional borders on adjacent 4's.
 * Complex components use 8 for the component fill, 6 for holes, and 2 for borders; however, small 1-row horizontal holes (≤2 cells wide) should be treated as part of the component (set to 8) with the row below in those columns set to 6 if it's component cells, to match thin enclosure patterns in training.
 * Borders are 8-directional (including diagonals) and only applied to adjacent 4's, turning them to 2's.
 * Grids are rectangular, with borders always 4's; components touching borders may have partial bordering.
 * Subtlety: False hole detection occurs if other components' 1's are treated as barriers during flood-fill, leading to simple components wrongly classified as complex (e.g., inheriting global holes).
 * Another subtlety: In some cases (e.g., train 2), certain enclosed areas are filled with 1's instead of 8/6, suggesting they are treated as "simple" despite apparent enclosure, possibly if the "hole" is not fully isolated or is part of a larger non-enclosing structure.
 * Ensure no overwriting of existing colors; process components independently but apply changes cumulatively to a copy of the input grid.
 * Background remains 4 unless bordered; no coloring of non-adjacent areas.
 * Potential miss: Vertical thin holes may not need special treatment like horizontal ones, based on training asymmetry.

    for r, c in component:
        grid[r][c] = 1
    add_border(grid, component)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies connected components and attempts per-component processing, but fails all training examples due to a critical bug in hole detection: `detect_holes` copies the full input grid (with all 1's as barriers) and only redundantly sets the current component to 1, resulting in global flood-fill that detects holes from all components combined; this causes simple components to falsely inherit holes from complex ones elsewhere, leading to wrong classification (e.g., setting 8's/6's instead of 1's/2's).
 * In train 1, generated output incorrectly uses 8's for the bottom simple horizontal/vertical bars (rows ~10-17, cols ~9-13 and longer in row 12), where expected uses 1's with 2 borders; also, the right complex shape has correct 8/6 structure but the special small-hole handling doesn't trigger properly, leaving extra 6's or mismatches in row 4-5 cols ~7-9; upper left simple shapes are correctly 1/2 but overall fails due to bottom error.
 * In train 2, generated uses 8's for multiple simple areas that should be 1's (e.g., rows 2-7 cols 0-8 expected 1's but generated 8's; row 10-11 cols 3-9 expected 1's but generated 8's; row 22-25 has mismatches in thin structures); complex areas like row 14-16 cols 13-18 have 6's matching expected, but global hole detection pollutes simple ones; no special handling for vertical 1's in row 22 col 4.
 * In train 3, generated incorrectly sets upper simple vertical bar (rows 3-6 cols 2-6) to 8's where expected 1's; lower complex shape (rows 12-16 cols 3-10) has 6's in row 14 cols 5-6 matching expected, but upper error due to false holes; special 1-row hole case in lower doesn't fully align (generated has extra 8's in row 6 col 12? but lists show minor col shifts); also, disconnected small shapes in rows 6-7 cols 11-13 expected 1's/2's but may have 8's.
 * `detect_holes` is broken/not helpful in current form (global barriers cause false positives; needs per-component isolation by setting temp to all 4's then only current comp to 1 before flooding from border 4's).
 * `handle_complex_component` is partially helpful but over-applies 8/6 without fixing detection; special case for 1-row holes (≤2 cols) is a good intuition for train 3 but triggers wrongly due to bug and doesn't handle all thin cases (e.g., vertical in train 2).
 * Overall, component isolation and bordering work, but hole-specific logic fails; no unhelpful functions beyond the buggy `detect_holes`.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same bug as training (global hole detection), likely over-applying 8's/6's to simple components (e.g., rows 9-12 show 8's in what appear to be non-enclosing bars cols 3-12; row 10 has 2's in cols 13-19 suggesting false bordering; row 22 has 8's/6's in cols 20-24 where thin structure may be simple 1's like train 2); complex areas like row 3-6 cols 8-16 have 6's that might be valid, but without expected, it's suspect—e.g., row 21-22 cols 19-25 look like a simple enclosure but get 8/6, possibly wrongly; borders (2's) are applied but may overreach due to false complexity; overall, it doesn't make sense for a correct solution as simple shapes (e.g., left side verticals) get 8's instead of 1's.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 13:56:57] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a binary grid (1s for shapes, 0s for background) to identify connected components of shapes, detect enclosed holes within them, and transform the grid by marking shapes with holes as 8 (filled), holes as 6 (empty interiors), adding 2 for borders around all shapes, and filling the rest with 4 for background. The goal is to distinguish simple shapes (left as 1) from complex ones with holes, while ensuring borders are applied correctly without overlapping or missing edges.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) for shapes, but borders use 8-connected neighborhoods to outline edges adjacent to background or other non-shape areas.
 * Holes are enclosed 0-regions fully surrounded by a single component; they must not be connected to the grid border or other components—subtle issue: hole detection must isolate the current component's interior from external space and other shapes.
 * Small or simple shapes without holes remain as 1s; only components with detected holes get fully marked as 8, with their interiors as 6.
 * Background is uniformly 4, but borders (2) are added only to positions adjacent to shapes (including holes? No, code adds to all_shape_pos borders if adjacent to 4, but 4 is background—wait, in code it's adjacent to 4 after processing).
 * Multiple components: Process each independently, but hole detection must temporarily mask other components to avoid false positives (e.g., treating external shapes as holes).
 * Subtle: Flood-fill for holes starts from borders but only on "other" areas set to 4; un-reachable 4s are treated as holes, which works if other components are isolated but fails if the current component encloses multiple disconnected "others" incorrectly.
 * Ensure deepcopy to avoid mutating input; visited arrays per operation to prevent cross-contamination.
 * Edge cases: Components touching border can't have "holes" connected to outside; diagonal connections don't count for component membership but do for bordering.
 * All positions must be overwritten: No 0s left in output; 1s only for untouched simple shapes.

                while q:

                    for dx, dy in directions4:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and g[nx][ny] == 1 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                            comp.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```

```python
def add_borders(output_grid: List[List[int]], shape_positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:  # Outlines all shapes with 2 where adjacent to background (4)
    h, w = len(output_grid), len(output_grid[0])
    for x, y in shape_positions:
        for dx, dy in directions8:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and output_grid[nx][ny] == 4:
                output_grid[nx][ny] = 2
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating correct handling of basic hole detection and bordering for those cases (e.g., isolated shapes with/without holes).
 * Hole detection via flooding other components as 4 and finding unvisited 4s works for training but may misclassify in complex layouts where multiple components interact (e.g., one shape enclosing another without direct connection).
 * Component extraction with BFS/DFS is solid and reusable; avoids revisiting cells efficiently.
 * Border addition is helpful but applied post-marking, which is good—ensures 2s only on background adjacent to shapes.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one assumes holes are "enclosed other components," which is a subtle mismatch: true holes should be 0-regions, not other 1-components (code treats enclosed other shapes as holes by setting to 4 and not flooding them).
 * The main program integrates components well but skips marking simple (no-hole) components, leaving them as 1—correct per rules.
 * detect_holes function is conceptually helpful for isolation but broken in logic: It sets other comps to 4 (treating them as potential "space"), floods border-connected 4s, and calls unvisited 4s "holes"—this accidentally detects enclosed other shapes as holes but misses true 0-holes inside the current comp (since 0s aren't set to 4).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core component finding and bordering but has flawed hole detection that luckily worked for training (perhaps training had no true 0-holes or enclosed shapes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a large central blob marked mostly as 8 with a small interior as 6 (likely a detected hole), bordered by 2s, which makes sense for a shape with an enclosed region; background is consistently 4.
 * A smaller blob at the bottom-right (rows 21-23, cols 20-24) is marked 8 with 6 in the center (row 22, cols 21-22), plus borders 2—looks correct for another holed shape.
 * Several small clusters of 1s remain untouched (e.g., row 11 cols 19-22; row 12 cols 18-25; row 13-14 cols 18-26; row 15-16 cols 18-26; row 17-20 cols 7-13), indicating simple components without holes—correct per rules, as they aren't overwritten.
 * Borders (2) are appropriately placed around all shapes, including extending to edges (e.g., left side of central blob), and no 0s remain—output is fully transformed.
 * Potential issue: The hole detection seems to have marked what might be an enclosed small shape (not a 0-hole) as 6 in the central blob (row 4-5 cols 13-15), which could be incorrect if the puzzle intends only 0-enclosures as holes; however, without input grid, it looks visually consistent with enclosing logic.
 * Another small 1-cluster at bottom (rows 17-20 cols 7-13) left as 1s, but bordered below—makes sense if no hole.
 * Overall, test output looks correct and structured: No obvious anomalies like overlapping marks or missed borders; it demonstrates understanding of multi-component grids with holes, though hole logic subtlety (0 vs. enclosed 1s) might be untested here.
 * The output handles a complex layout with multiple shapes, some touching (e.g., bottom 1s adjacent to borders), without bleeding marks—appears sensible.
