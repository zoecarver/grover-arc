=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 07:50:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 08:02:32] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains vertical wall columns (marked by 5s in the top row) that divide the grid into panels of equal width w, each panel featuring a colored pattern (non-zero cells of a specific color, with 0s as empty space and 5s as walls). The goal is to generate a larger square output grid of size s x s (where s = w * w) by extracting the first three patterns, determining if the first is a "block" (solid full-width non-zeros), and then tiling/combining these patterns into upper and lower sections using either block-style (repetitive horizontal/vertical copies) or pointy-style (diagonal or offset placements) arrangements, incorporating colors from a seed row (last non-empty row).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly columns where the top row (row 0) has a 5; panels start right after each wall and span to the next wall or end, with all panels assumed equal width w (computed from first panel).
 * Colors are sampled from the center of each panel in the seed row (last row with any non-0/non-5 cells); patterns are extracted by replacing non-wall/non-zero cells with the panel's color and handling wall rows specially (e.g., center 0, sides color if blocky).
 * Only the first three panels (m >= 3 assumed) are used; if fewer, output is zeroed grid.
 * Block detection: A pattern is a "block" if every row has exactly w non-zero cells (full width); this decides between block filling (repetitive copies, e.g., (w-1) vertical reps of patterns in upper, horizontal in lower) vs. pointy filling (offset or mirrored placements, e.g., third pattern left in upper pointy, first right).
 * Upper block: (w-1) vertical reps of second pattern left, (w-1) vertical reps of third with (w-1) horizontal shifts right.
 * Lower block: First pattern left, second pattern right-shifted.
 * Upper pointy: (w-1) vertical reps of third left, (w-1) vertical reps of first right-shifted.
 * Lower pointy: First? Wait, code has second with (w-1) horizontal left, but may be incomplete/misordered.
 * Subtlety: Patterns may have internal structure (e.g., holes or shapes like diamonds), and filling must preserve this while tiling; walls (5s) in input are ignored in output except for defining panels.
 * Seed row is bottom-up search for last row with non-0/non-5; if all empty, defaults to 0 (may cause issues if no content).
 * Output is always s x s zeros init, filled only in upper (first w*(w-1) rows) and lower (last w rows); middle may remain zero if not filled.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal repetitions in right sections are (w-1) copies side-by-side; pointy may imply diagonal offsets not fully captured in code (e.g., ex1 expected has zeroed middle in upper). Assume w prime or fixed per example (3 for ex1, 5 for ex3/test). Handle m<3 by zero grid, but examples have m>=3.
 * Patterns replace 5s/0s with color only if non-wall row; wall rows (majority 5s) get special treatment (center 0, sides color).
 * Global: Input may have trailing empty panels or uneven widths (but code assumes equal); output colors must match input exactly, no blending.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def find_wall_cols(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not g:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    return [j for j in range(cols) if g[0][j] == 5]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies wall positions from top row.)

```python
def find_panel_starts(wall_cols: List[int], cols: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = [0]
    for wall in wall_cols:
        if wall + 1 < cols:
            starts.append(wall + 1)
    return starts
```
(Helpful: Defines panel start columns correctly, including initial at 0.)

```python
def get_w(starts: List[int], wall_cols: List[int], cols: int) -> int:
    if not starts:
        return 0
    next_wall = wall_cols[0] if wall_cols else cols
    return next_wall - starts[0]
```
(Helpful: Computes uniform panel width w from first panel; assumes all equal, which holds in examples.)

```python
def find_seed_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    for i in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):
        if any(cell != 0 and cell != 5 for cell in g[i]):
            return i
    return 0
```
(Helpful: Finds last informative row for color sampling; defaults to 0 if empty.)

```python
def get_colors(g: List[List[int]], seed_row: int, starts: List[int], w: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    colors = []
    for k in range(m):
        center = starts[k] + w // 2
        colors.append(g[seed_row][center])
    return colors
```
(Helpful: Extracts per-panel color from center cell in seed row.)

```python
def get_patterns(g: List[List[int]], starts: List[int], w: int, m: int, colors: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    patterns = []
    for k in range(m):
        pat = []
        for r in range(w):  # Assumes input height == w? No, input rows >=w, but extracts first w rows per panel.
            row = []
            five_count = sum(1 for jj in range(w) if g[r][starts[k] + jj] == 5)
            is_wall_row = five_count > w // 2
            for jj in range(w):
                cell = g[r][starts[k] + jj]
                if is_wall_row:
                    if jj == w // 2:
                        row.append(0)
                    else:
                        row.append(colors[k])
                elif cell != 0 and cell != 5:
                    row.append(colors[k])
                else:
                    row.append(0)
            pat.append(row)
        patterns.append(pat)
    return patterns
```
(Helpful but subtle bug: Assumes input has at least w rows and extracts only first w rows per panel; wall detection per row (>half 5s) replaces with color except center 0. Preserves shape by coloring non-0/non-5.)

```python
def is_block(pattern: List[List[int]], w: int) -> bool:
    return all(sum(1 for x in row if x != 0) == w for row in pattern)
```
(Helpful: Checks if pattern is solid block by full non-zero rows; used to branch filling style.)

(The fill functions like fill_upper_block, fill_lower_block, etc., are partially helpful for tiling logic but buggy in placement/offset for pointy/block variants, as seen in mismatches.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (w=3, colors 7/1/6?): Used block filling (assuming p0 block), but upper section mismatched: generated repeated 7s/1s vertically without zeroed middle transition (rows 3-5 all filled with 7s/1s, but expected has zeros left/middle in rows 3-5 with 7s/1s right); lower matched expected 6s/0s/7s. Block detection likely correct, but upper filling didn't insert zero separator or offset properly.
 * Training example 2: Fully correct, so panel extraction, color sampling, and filling logic worked for that case (likely block or pointy matched exactly).
 * Training example 3 (w=5, colors 6/3/8?): Used pointy filling (p0 not block), but generated massive repetition of 6-pattern upper (20 rows of tiled 6s with 3s bottom-right, ignoring integration) and incomplete 8s lower; expected integrates 6/8/3 across sections with offsets (e.g., row 0 has 6s left + 8s right spanning panels, row 5 has 8s full right but zeros middle, lower has mixed 3/6 with 0s). Patterns extracted wrong (over-replaced 0s/5s without preserving holes), and filling didn't handle horizontal spans or middle zero blocks (rows 10-14 have isolated 6-pattern then 3/6 mixed).
 * Overall: Assumes input height >=w and extracts only top w rows for patterns (may miss vertical extent in taller inputs like ex3's 25 rows). Only uses first 3 patterns, ignoring extras (ex3 has more?). Block/pointy branching works sometimes (ex2) but placements off (no diagonal offsets in pointy, wrong rep counts in upper right). get_patterns replaces too aggressively, losing shape subtleties (e.g., ex3 expected preserves sparse 8s/0s patterns). fill_upper_pointy/fill_lower_pointy incomplete (e.g., lower pointy only places second pattern horizontally, missing first/third). No handling for seed_row beyond w rows or uneven panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It repeats a 1-pattern (w=5, sparse 1s like a cross/diamond) across ~20 upper rows with no integration or offsets (just vertical/horizontal tiles of 1s, 3s bottom-right), then a partial 4-pattern (striped 4s/0s) in lower 5 rows, leaving middle/right sparse. This ignores expected integration like ex3 (e.g., no color mixing across panels, no zero separators, no pointy offsets); likely p0 not block so pointy mode, but filling buggy (reps too many/simplistic). It resembles ex3 generated (repetitive, non-integrated), suggesting same extraction/fill flaws: over-tiling without shape preservation or section boundaries. Test likely expects blended 1/3/4 patterns with zeros/holes (e.g., upper pointy with 4 right-spanning 1 left, lower mixed 3/1 with 4 stripes offset), but generated is disjoint/empty in places (e.g., many 0s right, no full s=25 coverage).

[2025-10-03 08:02:32] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 08:22:07] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid (likely representing layered or evolving patterns of colored blocks or shapes separated by dividers like 5s) is transformed into a square output grid by extracting, possibly inverting or swapping, and tiling specific pattern segments based on "centers" and colors identified in the bottom row of the input. The output seems to build a larger composite image by repeating or shifting these patterns vertically and horizontally, potentially simulating stacking or evolution of objects across sections divided by horizontal separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The bottom row contains key "centers" (groups of consecutive non-zero values representing object positions/colors), with widths derived from minimum differences between centers minus one; limit to up to 3 centers, padding if fewer, and handle dummy centers with color 0.
 * Horizontal separators (rows with many 5s, > half columns) divide the grid into sections; the first section's height (up to first separator or full height) determines pattern extraction depth, assumed to equal width w.
 * Patterns are extracted as binary (1 for non-0/non-5, 0 otherwise) from local windows around each center (±w//2), truncated/padded to exactly w length; these represent shapes of left/mid/right objects.
 * "Used" colors in the first section determine swapping: if right color appears early, use mid for main block and right for tiling; detect "swap mode" if left-top pattern starts/ends empty (suggesting inversion or shift).
 * Special inversion rule: for right-sourced blocks, if middle row has only center 1, invert the pattern (flip 0s/1s).
 * Tiling in output (size w*w): left block (cols 0 to w-1) from selected source (left/right/mid based on mode/used), repeated vertically (mod first_h); right tiling starts at col w (or later with empties in swap mode), places (w-1) tiles of the remaining pattern horizontally, filling only where pattern has 1s, without wrapping beyond size.
 * Subtleties: Output is square but input may be rectangular/tall; handle edge cases like no centers (all-zero output), multiple groups in bottom, or asymmetric windows (max(0,start) to min(n_cols,end)); middle row special cases (e.g., only-center inversion) suggest shape evolution or symmetry rules; dividers (5s) are ignored in patterns but define sections; colors are preserved from bottom centers; test inputs may have more sections or larger widths, leading to all-zero if centers not detected.
 * Potential misses: Full grid may have multiple sections beyond first (e.g., training 3 shows evolving patterns downward), requiring sequential processing or stacking; inversion might apply more broadly; tiling may shift positions (e.g., expected shows left-shifted blocks with leading 0s); w calculation assumes uniform spacing but may vary; dummy padding affects colors but not positions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def find_centers(bottom: List[int], n_cols: int) -> List[int]:
    """Extract rounded average positions of consecutive non-0 groups in bottom row."""

    return sep_rows[0] if sep_rows else n_rows - 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt correctly identifies centers via grouping consecutive non-0s in bottom and computes w as min diff -1, which works for uniform spacing but fails if diffs vary or groups overlap.
 * Pattern extraction as binary around centers (±w//2 window) is helpful and captures shapes accurately for first section, but ignores later sections (e.g., training 3 expected evolves patterns downward with new colors like 6->3, leading to incomplete stacking).
 * Swap mode detection (left-top empty at edges) and used-color check (right_color in first section) partially work for deciding sources (left/mid/right), but misapplies: in training 1, generates repeating 7/1 without left-shifting to 0-padded 7/1 in mid section, and misses bottom 6 introduction.
 * Inversion logic for right block (middle row only-center -> flip) is subtle but incorrectly applied or absent in outputs: training 1 generated no inversion, resulting in solid blocks instead of expected sparse 7/0/7 patterns.
 * Tiling logic places main block left and tiles rightward, but bugs in start position (e.g., w + num_empty*w in swap, or simple w otherwise) and loop (w-1 tiles without full coverage) cause underfilling: training 1 tiles only partial 1s without full row replication; training 2 repeats 3/7 but misses bottom 9 full row and sparse 9/0/9.
 * First section height detection via 5-separators works but assumes first_h == w (untrue in larger grids like training 3, where w~5 but sections taller, leading to mod first_h wrapping incorrectly).
 * Padding centers to 3 with dummies (color 0) is attempted but breaks if g_num <3, as bottom padding assumes extra cols (causes index errors or wrong colors).
 * Overall, program handles small uniform cases partially (e.g., detects colors 7/1/6) but fails multi-section evolution (training 3 generated endless repetition of top patterns instead of descending 8->0->6->3 with shifts); no handling for output size beyond w*w assumption.
 * Function to compute diffs/w is helpful but min(diffs)-1 assumes spacing >1; broken if g_num<2 (no diffs, crashes).
 * No extraction for full grid objects beyond first section; a broader extract_objects would be essential but missing, leading to static outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is all zeros across a 16x30 grid (non-square, unlike w*w logic), which does not look correct as it suggests no patterns detected (likely zero centers in bottom or g_num==0 early return), but expected should derive from test input's bottom centers/patterns (test input not shown, but implies non-empty grid with potential w~5-6 based on training scales).
 * All-zero output ignores any input structure, missing tiling/shifting (e.g., if test has multiple sections like training 3, should stack evolved patterns with colors from bottom groups); this indicates failure to handle large/variable widths or absent separators.
 * Output dimensions (16 rows, 30 cols) mismatch square assumption, suggesting program didn't compute w correctly or truncated; expected likely a square subsection or full transform with shifts/0-padding as in training 1's mid/bottom sections.
 * No colors or patterns appear, confirming broken center detection or pattern extraction for this input (possibly wider bottom groups or no non-0s, but unlikely for puzzle test).

[2025-10-03 08:22:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid (likely representing layered or evolving patterns of colored blocks or shapes separated by dividers like 5s) is transformed into a square output grid by extracting, possibly inverting or swapping, and tiling specific pattern segments based on "centers" and colors identified in the bottom row of the input. The output seems to build a larger composite image by repeating or shifting these patterns vertically and horizontally, potentially simulating stacking or evolution of objects across sections divided by horizontal separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The bottom row contains key "centers" (groups of consecutive non-zero values representing object positions/colors), with widths derived from minimum differences between centers minus one; limit to up to 3 centers, padding if fewer, and handle dummy centers with color 0.
 * Horizontal separators (rows with many 5s, > half columns) divide the grid into sections; the first section's height (up to first separator or full height) determines pattern extraction depth, assumed to equal width w.
 * Patterns are extracted as binary (1 for non-0/non-5, 0 otherwise) from local windows around each center (±w//2), truncated/padded to exactly w length; these represent shapes of left/mid/right objects.
 * "Used" colors in the first section determine swapping: if right color appears early, use mid for main block and right for tiling; detect "swap mode" if left-top pattern starts/ends empty (suggesting inversion or shift).
 * Special inversion rule: for right-sourced blocks, if middle row has only center 1, invert the pattern (flip 0s/1s).
 * Tiling in output (size w*w): left block (cols 0 to w-1) from selected source (left/right/mid based on mode/used), repeated vertically (mod first_h); right tiling starts at col w (or later with empties in swap mode), places (w-1) tiles of the remaining pattern horizontally, filling only where pattern has 1s, without wrapping beyond size.
 * Subtleties: Output is square but input may be rectangular/tall; handle edge cases like no centers (all-zero output), multiple groups in bottom, or asymmetric windows (max(0,start) to min(n_cols,end)); middle row special cases (e.g., only-center inversion) suggest shape evolution or symmetry rules; dividers (5s) are ignored in patterns but define sections; colors are preserved from bottom centers; test inputs may have more sections or larger widths, leading to all-zero if centers not detected.
 * Potential misses: Full grid may have multiple sections beyond first (e.g., training 3 shows evolving patterns downward), requiring sequential processing or stacking; inversion might apply more broadly; tiling may shift positions (e.g., expected shows left-shifted blocks with leading 0s); w calculation assumes uniform spacing but may vary; dummy padding affects colors but not positions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt correctly identifies centers via grouping consecutive non-0s in bottom and computes w as min diff -1, which works for uniform spacing but fails if diffs vary or groups overlap.

 * Inversion logic for right block (middle row only-center -> flip) is subtle but incorrectly applied or absent in outputs: training 1 generated no inversion, resulting in solid blocks instead of expected sparse 7/0/7 patterns.
 * Tiling logic places main block left and tiles rightward, but bugs in start position (e.g., w + num_empty*w in swap, or simple w otherwise) and loop (w-1 tiles without full coverage) cause underfilling: training 1 tiles only partial 1s without full row replication; training 2 repeats 3/7 but misses bottom 9 full row and sparse 9/0/9.
 * First section height detection via 5-separators works but assumes first_h == w (untrue in larger grids like training 3, where w~5 but sections taller, leading to mod first_h wrapping incorrectly).

 * No extraction for full grid objects beyond first section; a broader extract_objects would be essential but missing, leading to static outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is all zeros across a 16x30 grid (non-square, unlike w*w logic), which does not look correct as it suggests no patterns detected (likely zero centers in bottom or g_num==0 early return), but expected should derive from test input's bottom centers/patterns (test input not shown, but implies non-empty grid with potential w~5-6 based on training scales).
 * All-zero output ignores any input structure, missing tiling/shifting (e.g., if test has multiple sections like training 3, should stack evolved patterns with colors from bottom groups); this indicates failure to handle large/variable widths or absent separators.
 * Output dimensions (16 rows, 30 cols) mismatch square assumption, suggesting program didn't compute w correctly or truncated; expected likely a square subsection or full transform with shifts/0-padding as in training 1's mid/bottom sections.
 * No colors or patterns appear, confirming broken center detection or pattern extraction for this input (possibly wider bottom groups or no non-0s, but unlikely for puzzle test).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains vertical wall columns (marked by 5s in the top row) that divide the grid into panels of equal width w, each panel featuring a colored pattern (non-zero cells of a specific color, with 0s as empty space and 5s as walls). The goal is to generate a larger square output grid of size s x s (where s = w * w) by extracting the first three patterns, determining if the first is a "block" (solid full-width non-zeros), and then tiling/combining these patterns into upper and lower sections using either block-style (repetitive horizontal/vertical copies) or pointy-style (diagonal or offset placements) arrangements, incorporating colors from a seed row (last non-empty row).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly columns where the top row (row 0) has a 5; panels start right after each wall and span to the next wall or end, with all panels assumed equal width w (computed from first panel).
 * Colors are sampled from the center of each panel in the seed row (last row with any non-0/non-5 cells); patterns are extracted by replacing non-wall/non-zero cells with the panel's color and handling wall rows specially (e.g., center 0, sides color if blocky).
 * Only the first three panels (m >= 3 assumed) are used; if fewer, output is zeroed grid.
 * Block detection: A pattern is a "block" if every row has exactly w non-zero cells (full width); this decides between block filling (repetitive copies, e.g., (w-1) vertical reps of patterns in upper, horizontal in lower) vs. pointy filling (offset or mirrored placements, e.g., third pattern left in upper pointy, first right).
 * Upper block: (w-1) vertical reps of second pattern left, (w-1) vertical reps of third with (w-1) horizontal shifts right.
 * Lower block: First pattern left, second pattern right-shifted.
 * Upper pointy: (w-1) vertical reps of third left, (w-1) vertical reps of first right-shifted.
 * Lower pointy: First? Wait, code has second with (w-1) horizontal left, but may be incomplete/misordered.
 * Subtlety: Patterns may have internal structure (e.g., holes or shapes like diamonds), and filling must preserve this while tiling; walls (5s) in input are ignored in output except for defining panels.
 * Seed row is bottom-up search for last row with non-0/non-5; if all empty, defaults to 0 (may cause issues if no content).
 * Output is always s x s zeros init, filled only in upper (first w*(w-1) rows) and lower (last w rows); middle may remain zero if not filled.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal repetitions in right sections are (w-1) copies side-by-side; pointy may imply diagonal offsets not fully captured in code (e.g., ex1 expected has zeroed middle in upper). Assume w prime or fixed per example (3 for ex1, 5 for ex3/test). Handle m<3 by zero grid, but examples have m>=3.
 * Patterns replace 5s/0s with color only if non-wall row; wall rows (majority 5s) get special treatment (center 0, sides color).
 * Global: Input may have trailing empty panels or uneven widths (but code assumes equal); output colors must match input exactly, no blending.

def find_wall_cols(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not g:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    return [j for j in range(cols) if g[0][j] == 5]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies wall positions from top row.)

```python
def find_panel_starts(wall_cols: List[int], cols: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = [0]
    for wall in wall_cols:
        if wall + 1 < cols:
            starts.append(wall + 1)
    return starts
```
(Helpful: Defines panel start columns correctly, including initial at 0.)

```python
def get_w(starts: List[int], wall_cols: List[int], cols: int) -> int:
    if not starts:
        return 0
    next_wall = wall_cols[0] if wall_cols else cols
    return next_wall - starts[0]
```
(Helpful: Computes uniform panel width w from first panel; assumes all equal, which holds in examples.)

```python
def find_seed_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    rows = len(g)
    for i in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):
        if any(cell != 0 and cell != 5 for cell in g[i]):
            return i
    return 0
```
(Helpful: Finds last informative row for color sampling; defaults to 0 if empty.)

```python
def get_colors(g: List[List[int]], seed_row: int, starts: List[int], w: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    colors = []
    for k in range(m):
        center = starts[k] + w // 2
        colors.append(g[seed_row][center])
    return colors
```
(Helpful: Extracts per-panel color from center cell in seed row.)

```python
def get_patterns(g: List[List[int]], starts: List[int], w: int, m: int, colors: List[int]) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    patterns = []
    for k in range(m):
        pat = []
        for r in range(w):  # Assumes input height == w? No, input rows >=w, but extracts first w rows per panel.
            row = []
            five_count = sum(1 for jj in range(w) if g[r][starts[k] + jj] == 5)
            is_wall_row = five_count > w // 2
            for jj in range(w):
                cell = g[r][starts[k] + jj]
                if is_wall_row:
                    if jj == w // 2:
                        row.append(0)
                    else:
                        row.append(colors[k])
                elif cell != 0 and cell != 5:
                    row.append(colors[k])
                else:
                    row.append(0)
            pat.append(row)
        patterns.append(pat)
    return patterns
```
(Helpful but subtle bug: Assumes input has at least w rows and extracts only first w rows per panel; wall detection per row (>half 5s) replaces with color except center 0. Preserves shape by coloring non-0/non-5.)

```python
def is_block(pattern: List[List[int]], w: int) -> bool:
    return all(sum(1 for x in row if x != 0) == w for row in pattern)
```
(Helpful: Checks if pattern is solid block by full non-zero rows; used to branch filling style.)

(The fill functions like fill_upper_block, fill_lower_block, etc., are partially helpful for tiling logic but buggy in placement/offset for pointy/block variants, as seen in mismatches.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (w=3, colors 7/1/6?): Used block filling (assuming p0 block), but upper section mismatched: generated repeated 7s/1s vertically without zeroed middle transition (rows 3-5 all filled with 7s/1s, but expected has zeros left/middle in rows 3-5 with 7s/1s right); lower matched expected 6s/0s/7s. Block detection likely correct, but upper filling didn't insert zero separator or offset properly.
 * Training example 2: Fully correct, so panel extraction, color sampling, and filling logic worked for that case (likely block or pointy matched exactly).
 * Training example 3 (w=5, colors 6/3/8?): Used pointy filling (p0 not block), but generated massive repetition of 6-pattern upper (20 rows of tiled 6s with 3s bottom-right, ignoring integration) and incomplete 8s lower; expected integrates 6/8/3 across sections with offsets (e.g., row 0 has 6s left + 8s right spanning panels, row 5 has 8s full right but zeros middle, lower has mixed 3/6 with 0s). Patterns extracted wrong (over-replaced 0s/5s without preserving holes), and filling didn't handle horizontal spans or middle zero blocks (rows 10-14 have isolated 6-pattern then 3/6 mixed).
 * Overall: Assumes input height >=w and extracts only top w rows for patterns (may miss vertical extent in taller inputs like ex3's 25 rows). Only uses first 3 patterns, ignoring extras (ex3 has more?). Block/pointy branching works sometimes (ex2) but placements off (no diagonal offsets in pointy, wrong rep counts in upper right). get_patterns replaces too aggressively, losing shape subtleties (e.g., ex3 expected preserves sparse 8s/0s patterns). fill_upper_pointy/fill_lower_pointy incomplete (e.g., lower pointy only places second pattern horizontally, missing first/third). No handling for seed_row beyond w rows or uneven panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It repeats a 1-pattern (w=5, sparse 1s like a cross/diamond) across ~20 upper rows with no integration or offsets (just vertical/horizontal tiles of 1s, 3s bottom-right), then a partial 4-pattern (striped 4s/0s) in lower 5 rows, leaving middle/right sparse. This ignores expected integration like ex3 (e.g., no color mixing across panels, no zero separators, no pointy offsets); likely p0 not block so pointy mode, but filling buggy (reps too many/simplistic). It resembles ex3 generated (repetitive, non-integrated), suggesting same extraction/fill flaws: over-tiling without shape preservation or section boundaries. Test likely expects blended 1/3/4 patterns with zeros/holes (e.g., upper pointy with 4 right-spanning 1 left, lower mixed 3/1 with 4 stripes offset), but generated is disjoint/empty in places (e.g., many 0s right, no full s=25 coverage).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 08:36:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a small input grid containing colored patterns (non-zero, non-5 cells) separated by vertical "walls" (columns with 5s, detected in the top row) is analyzed to extract up to 3 panel patterns of equal width (w), each with a representative color from a "seed row" (the lowest row with meaningful content). These patterns are then rearranged and tiled into a larger w x w super-grid (s = w^2 rows/cols) using one of two modes: "block mode" if the first pattern (p0) is a solid block (fully non-zero rows), or "pointy mode" otherwise, involving specific placements of p0, p1, and p2 across super-rows and super-columns, with padding for fewer than 3 panels.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly columns where the top row (g[0]) has a 5; panels start immediately after each wall (or at 0), and w is the distance from a panel start to the next wall (or end of grid).
 * Up to 3 panels (m = min(3, len(starts))); if fewer, pad with empty (all-0) patterns and color 0.
 * Seed row is the last (bottom-most) row with any non-0, non-5 cells; panel colors are sampled from the center column (starts[k] + w//2) of that row.
 * Pattern extraction in get_patterns is complex and error-prone: it scans from top (r=0 to w-1, but input grid may be taller/shorter?), identifies "wall rows" within a panel if > w//2 cells are 5s, then fills wall rows with color[k] except center (0), and non-wall rows with color[k] only where input has non-0/non-5, else 0. This seems to "colorize" sparse patterns but may over/under-fill based on input density.
 * Block detection (is_block) checks if every row in a pattern has exactly w non-zero cells (full width filled); subtle: this assumes patterns are w x w, but input rows may not align perfectly.
 * In block mode (if p0 is block): For each super-row i (0 to w-1), place p1 in super-col i, and p2 in all super-cols i+1 to w-1 of that super-row; additionally, overlay p0 at the bottom-left super position (super-row w-1, super-col 0). This creates a staggered fill but may overwrite if not careful (code doesn't handle overlaps explicitly).
 * In pointy mode (default): For super-rows 0 to w-2, place p2 in super-col 0 (left) and p0 in super-col w-1 (right); for the bottom super-row (w-1), place p1 across super-cols 0 to w-2 (horizontal band, excluding rightmost). Subtle: no placement in bottom-right, left as 0s; assumes "pointy" refers to triangular/pointed arrangements.
 * Output is always s x s (s=w^2), with super-tiling (each super-cell is a w x w pattern block).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid -> empty output; w=0 -> all-0 s x s with s=n_cols^2 (fallback, but unclear); input taller than w? Patterns only take first w rows? (code caps at w but pads with 0s if short).
 * Colors are per-panel but applied uniformly within patterns; 0s are background/empty.
 * Subtlety in wall row detection: Counts 5s per panel slice (starts[k] to starts[k]+w-1), but only if > w//2; this may misclassify dense 5s as walls incorrectly if input has horizontal walls.
 * Patterns may not capture full input height; code forces w x w by taking r in 0 to w-1 from input rows 0+, but input may have patterns spanning more/less.
 * Padding empty patterns to 3 affects mode: empty p0 (all 0s) is not a block, so defaults to pointy mode, which may not match cases with fewer panels.
 * No rotation, flipping, or scaling of patterns; direct copy-placement.
 * Input may have multiple seed rows or varying densities; center color sampling assumes odd/even w handles center correctly (w//2 integer div).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def find_wall_cols(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Extracts wall columns based on 5s in the top row (g[0]). Helpful for identifying panel boundaries, but limited to top row only—may miss vertical walls not starting at top."""

    return starts

def get_w(starts: List[int], wall_cols: List[int], cols: int) -> int:
    """Computes panel width w as distance from first start to next wall (or end). Core for sizing, but assumes uniform w across panels—fails if uneven."""
    if not starts:
        return 0
    next_wall = wall_cols[0] if wall_cols else cols
    return next_wall - starts[0]

def find_seed_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Finds the bottom-most row with non-0, non-5 cells. Useful for color sampling, but scans from bottom up correctly."""
    rows = len(g)
    for i in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):
        if any(cell != 0 and cell != 5 for cell in g[i]):
            return i
    return 0

def get_colors(g: List[List[int]], seed_row: int, starts: List[int], w: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    """Samples color for each panel from seed_row center. Straightforward and helpful, bounds-checked."""
    colors = []
    n_cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    for k in range(m):
        center = starts[k] + w // 2
        color = g[seed_row][center] if center < n_cols and seed_row < len(g) else 0
        colors.append(color)
    return colors
```

```python
def is_block(pattern: List[List[int]], w: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if pattern is a solid block (every row fully non-zero). Key for mode selection, but strict—rows with any 0 fail, even if minor."""
    return all(sum(1 for x in row if x != 0) == w for row in pattern)
```

The get_patterns function is overly complex and likely buggy (tries to reconstruct patterns by filling with colors based on wall detection per row, but doesn't copy input faithfully; it sets to color[k] in specific cases, leading to over-coloring). Not helpful as-is—better to copy input slices directly and then apply colors only to non-0/non-5. The main program function orchestrates tiling but has mode-specific placement logic that works for simple cases but fails on integrated patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Successfully extracted panels, computed w/colors/modes, and tiled in block/pointy modes for uniform/simple patterns (e.g., solid blocks or pointy arrangements without overlaps/misalignments).
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated repeating 5x5 blocks of a 6-pattern (alternating rows of full 6s and pointy 6s) in the left super-section (rows 0-19, cols 0-19), with misplaced 3-pattern fragments in bottom-right of that section (e.g., rows 20-24 have 3s but shifted/incomplete), and a separate 8-checkerboard-like pattern in rows 20-24 cols 0-19 (but actually rows 20-24 are all 8-pattern, overwriting?). Expected integrates 8s directly into the 6-pattern blocks (e.g., row 0 has 6s then full 8s from col 5; row 1 has 6s then 8-checker starting col 6), with lower super-rows (e.g., 5-9) having isolated 6-patterns without 8s, mid-section (10-14) plain 6s, and bottom (15-24) mixing 3s and 6s in pointy/block style but with 8s absent. Difference: Generated separates patterns into disjoint blocks without integration/overlays; expected blends 8-pattern into upper 6-blocks (perhaps p2=8 overlays p0/p1=6 in specific positions), and lower sections use different panel combos (e.g., p1=3, p0/p2=6 without 8s). Unknown why: Likely mode detection wrong (is p0 a block here? Generated uses pointy? But output looks blocky-repeating), or pattern extraction fills too uniformly without preserving input sparsity.
 * Fallback for w=0 creates all-0 grid sized to n_cols^2, but untested—may not apply.
 * Padding to 3 empty patterns forces pointy mode if p0 empty (not block), which may mismatch cases with 2 panels.
 * get_patterns over-applies colors (e.g., sets entire non-wall rows to color if any non-0/non-5, but code only sets if cell !=0 and !=5, else 0; still, wall rows set to color except center 0, which may invent patterns not in input).
 * Tiling in block mode places p1 per super-row i in col i, p2 in i+1:, but adds p0 only at fixed bottom-left—may not cover all if w>2, and no overlap resolution.
 * Pointy mode leaves bottom-right empty, but in train3 generated, it filled with 3s/8s incorrectly, suggesting mode mis-trigger or extra placements.
 * Overall, core panel extraction (walls, starts, w, colors, seed) works for train1/2; tiling logic partially works but fails integration in train3 (generated has no 8s in upper 6s, wrong 3-placement, extra 8-block at bottom).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It repeats a 1-pattern (similar to the 6-pointy in train3: alternating full rows of 1s and pointy 1s) across left super-section (rows 0-19, cols 0-19) with 3-fragments misplaced in bottom-right there (e.g., row 20 has full 3s but shifted), then a 4-pattern (alternating full 4 rows and pointy 4 rows, like a striped checker) in rows 20-24 cols 0-19, but abruptly cuts off without integrating into a full s=25 grid (wait, it shows only up to row 24, but placements suggest w=5, s=25). This mirrors train3 error: Disjoint repeating blocks without blending (e.g., no 4s overlaying 1s or 3s in expected pointy/block style), and 3s appear as a separate bottom band but incomplete/fragmented (e.g., row 1 has 1s then 3s starting col 20?). Expected likely similar to train3: Upper super-rows blend panels (e.g., 1-pattern with 4-checker integrated like 6+8), mid/lower use 1+3 combos without 4s, bottom horizontal 3-band or mixed. Why incorrect: Same issues as train3—pattern extraction probably over-fills 1/4 to solid/pointy without input fidelity, mode likely pointy (repeating left/right placements), but no overlays; 3s from p1? but placed wrong. Does not make sense: Lacks the subtle integrations/omissions seen in expected train3 (e.g., some super-blocks are pure one pattern, others blended), and the 4-pattern at bottom looks like an extra unintended block rather than tiled super.

[2025-10-03 08:36:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid (likely representing layered or evolving patterns of colored blocks or shapes separated by dividers like 5s) is transformed into a square output grid by extracting, possibly inverting or swapping, and tiling specific pattern segments based on "centers" and colors identified in the bottom row of the input. The output seems to build a larger composite image by repeating or shifting these patterns vertically and horizontally, potentially simulating stacking or evolution of objects across sections divided by horizontal separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The bottom row contains key "centers" (groups of consecutive non-zero values representing object positions/colors), with widths derived from minimum differences between centers minus one; limit to up to 3 centers, padding if fewer, and handle dummy centers with color 0.
 * Horizontal separators (rows with many 5s, > half columns) divide the grid into sections; the first section's height (up to first separator or full height) determines pattern extraction depth, assumed to equal width w.
 * Patterns are extracted as binary (1 for non-0/non-5, 0 otherwise) from local windows around each center (±w//2), truncated/padded to exactly w length; these represent shapes of left/mid/right objects.
 * "Used" colors in the first section determine swapping: if right color appears early, use mid for main block and right for tiling; detect "swap mode" if left-top pattern starts/ends empty (suggesting inversion or shift).
 * Special inversion rule: for right-sourced blocks, if middle row has only center 1, invert the pattern (flip 0s/1s).
 * Tiling in output (size w*w): left block (cols 0 to w-1) from selected source (left/right/mid based on mode/used), repeated vertically (mod first_h); right tiling starts at col w (or later with empties in swap mode), places (w-1) tiles of the remaining pattern horizontally, filling only where pattern has 1s, without wrapping beyond size.
 * Subtleties: Output is square but input may be rectangular/tall; handle edge cases like no centers (all-zero output), multiple groups in bottom, or asymmetric windows (max(0,start) to min(n_cols,end)); middle row special cases (e.g., only-center inversion) suggest shape evolution or symmetry rules; dividers (5s) are ignored in patterns but define sections; colors are preserved from bottom centers; test inputs may have more sections or larger widths, leading to all-zero if centers not detected.
 * Potential misses: Full grid may have multiple sections beyond first (e.g., training 3 shows evolving patterns downward), requiring sequential processing or stacking; inversion might apply more broadly; tiling may shift positions (e.g., expected shows left-shifted blocks with leading 0s); w calculation assumes uniform spacing but may vary; dummy padding affects colors but not positions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def find_centers(bottom: List[int], n_cols: int) -> List[int]:
    """Extract rounded average positions of consecutive non-0 groups in bottom row."""
    centers = []
    i = 0
    while i < n_cols:
        if bottom[i] == 0:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        while i < n_cols and bottom[i] != 0:
            i += 1
        avg = (start + i - 1) / 2
        centers.append(round(avg))
    return centers[:3]  # Limit to 3, as per logic
```

```python
def extract_patterns(g: List[List[int]], centers: List[int], w: int, first_h: int) -> tuple:
    """Extract binary patterns for left/mid/right from first section around centers."""
    left_pats, mid_pats, right_pats = [], [], []
    left_c, mid_c, right_c = centers
    for r in range(first_h):
        # Left pattern
        l_start = max(0, left_c - w // 2)
        l_end = min(len(g[0]), left_c + w // 2 + 1)
        l_pat = [1 if g[r][j] != 0 and g[r][j] != 5 else 0 for j in range(l_start, l_end)]
        l_pat = l_pat[:w]  # Truncate/pad implicitly by slicing
        left_pats.append(l_pat)
        
        # Similar for mid and right (omitted for brevity, mirror logic)
        # ...
        mid_pats.append(m_pat)
        right_pats.append(r_pat)
    return left_pats, mid_pats, right_pats
```

```python
def find_first_section(g: List[List[int]], n_cols: int) -> int:
    """Find height of first section up to first separator row with > n_cols//2 fives."""
    n_rows = len(g)
    sep_rows = [i for i in range(n_rows - 1) if sum(1 for v in g[i] if v == 5) > n_cols // 2]
    return sep_rows[0] if sep_rows else n_rows - 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt correctly identifies centers via grouping consecutive non-0s in bottom and computes w as min diff -1, which works for uniform spacing but fails if diffs vary or groups overlap.
 * Pattern extraction as binary around centers (±w//2 window) is helpful and captures shapes accurately for first section, but ignores later sections (e.g., training 3 expected evolves patterns downward with new colors like 6->3, leading to incomplete stacking).
 * Swap mode detection (left-top empty at edges) and used-color check (right_color in first section) partially work for deciding sources (left/mid/right), but misapplies: in training 1, generates repeating 7/1 without left-shifting to 0-padded 7/1 in mid section, and misses bottom 6 introduction.
 * Inversion logic for right block (middle row only-center -> flip) is subtle but incorrectly applied or absent in outputs: training 1 generated no inversion, resulting in solid blocks instead of expected sparse 7/0/7 patterns.
 * Tiling logic places main block left and tiles rightward, but bugs in start position (e.g., w + num_empty*w in swap, or simple w otherwise) and loop (w-1 tiles without full coverage) cause underfilling: training 1 tiles only partial 1s without full row replication; training 2 repeats 3/7 but misses bottom 9 full row and sparse 9/0/9.
 * First section height detection via 5-separators works but assumes first_h == w (untrue in larger grids like training 3, where w~5 but sections taller, leading to mod first_h wrapping incorrectly).
 * Padding centers to 3 with dummies (color 0) is attempted but breaks if g_num <3, as bottom padding assumes extra cols (causes index errors or wrong colors).
 * Overall, program handles small uniform cases partially (e.g., detects colors 7/1/6) but fails multi-section evolution (training 3 generated endless repetition of top patterns instead of descending 8->0->6->3 with shifts); no handling for output size beyond w*w assumption.
 * Function to compute diffs/w is helpful but min(diffs)-1 assumes spacing >1; broken if g_num<2 (no diffs, crashes).
 * No extraction for full grid objects beyond first section; a broader extract_objects would be essential but missing, leading to static outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is all zeros across a 16x30 grid (non-square, unlike w*w logic), which does not look correct as it suggests no patterns detected (likely zero centers in bottom or g_num==0 early return), but expected should derive from test input's bottom centers/patterns (test input not shown, but implies non-empty grid with potential w~5-6 based on training scales).
 * All-zero output ignores any input structure, missing tiling/shifting (e.g., if test has multiple sections like training 3, should stack evolved patterns with colors from bottom groups); this indicates failure to handle large/variable widths or absent separators.
 * Output dimensions (16 rows, 30 cols) mismatch square assumption, suggesting program didn't compute w correctly or truncated; expected likely a square subsection or full transform with shifts/0-padding as in training 1's mid/bottom sections.
 * No colors or patterns appear, confirming broken center detection or pattern extraction for this input (possibly wider bottom groups or no non-0s, but unlikely for puzzle test).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains vertical wall columns (marked by 5s in the top row) that divide the grid into panels of equal width w, each panel featuring a colored pattern (non-zero cells of a specific color, with 0s as empty space and 5s as walls). The goal is to generate a larger square output grid of size s x s (where s = w * w) by extracting the first three patterns, determining if the first is a "block" (solid full-width non-zeros), and then tiling/combining these patterns into upper and lower sections using either block-style (repetitive horizontal/vertical copies) or pointy-style (diagonal or offset placements) arrangements, incorporating colors from a seed row (last non-empty row).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly columns where the top row (row 0) has a 5; panels start right after each wall and span to the next wall or end, with all panels assumed equal width w (computed from first panel).
 * Colors are sampled from the center of each panel in the seed row (last row with any non-0/non-5 cells); patterns are extracted by replacing non-wall/non-zero cells with the panel's color and handling wall rows specially (e.g., center 0, sides color if blocky).
 * Only the first three panels (m >= 3 assumed) are used; if fewer, output is zeroed grid.
 * Block detection: A pattern is a "block" if every row has exactly w non-zero cells (full width); this decides between block filling (repetitive copies, e.g., (w-1) vertical reps of patterns in upper, horizontal in lower) vs. pointy filling (offset or mirrored placements, e.g., third pattern left in upper pointy, first right).
 * Upper block: (w-1) vertical reps of second pattern left, (w-1) vertical reps of third with (w-1) horizontal shifts right.
 * Lower block: First pattern left, second pattern right-shifted.
 * Upper pointy: (w-1) vertical reps of third left, (w-1) vertical reps of first right-shifted.
 * Lower pointy: First? Wait, code has second with (w-1) horizontal left, but may be incomplete/misordered.
 * Subtlety: Patterns may have internal structure (e.g., holes or shapes like diamonds), and filling must preserve this while tiling; walls (5s) in input are ignored in output except for defining panels.
 * Seed row is bottom-up search for last row with non-0/non-5; if all empty, defaults to 0 (may cause issues if no content).
 * Output is always s x s zeros init, filled only in upper (first w*(w-1) rows) and lower (last w rows); middle may remain zero if not filled.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal repetitions in right sections are (w-1) copies side-by-side; pointy may imply diagonal offsets not fully captured in code (e.g., ex1 expected has zeroed middle in upper). Assume w prime or fixed per example (3 for ex1, 5 for ex3/test). Handle m<3 by zero grid, but examples have m>=3.
 * Patterns replace 5s/0s with color only if non-wall row; wall rows (majority 5s) get special treatment (center 0, sides color).
 * Global: Input may have trailing empty panels or uneven widths (but code assumes equal); output colors must match input exactly, no blending.

(Helpful but subtle bug: Assumes input has at least w rows and extracts only first w rows per panel; wall detection per row (>half 5s) replaces with color except center 0. Preserves shape by coloring non-0/non-5.)

    return all(sum(1 for x in row if x != 0) == w for row in pattern)
```
(Helpful: Checks if pattern is solid block by full non-zero rows; used to branch filling style.)

(The fill functions like fill_upper_block, fill_lower_block, etc., are partially helpful for tiling logic but buggy in placement/offset for pointy/block variants, as seen in mismatches.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (w=3, colors 7/1/6?): Used block filling (assuming p0 block), but upper section mismatched: generated repeated 7s/1s vertically without zeroed middle transition (rows 3-5 all filled with 7s/1s, but expected has zeros left/middle in rows 3-5 with 7s/1s right); lower matched expected 6s/0s/7s. Block detection likely correct, but upper filling didn't insert zero separator or offset properly.
 * Training example 2: Fully correct, so panel extraction, color sampling, and filling logic worked for that case (likely block or pointy matched exactly).
 * Training example 3 (w=5, colors 6/3/8?): Used pointy filling (p0 not block), but generated massive repetition of 6-pattern upper (20 rows of tiled 6s with 3s bottom-right, ignoring integration) and incomplete 8s lower; expected integrates 6/8/3 across sections with offsets (e.g., row 0 has 6s left + 8s right spanning panels, row 5 has 8s full right but zeros middle, lower has mixed 3/6 with 0s). Patterns extracted wrong (over-replaced 0s/5s without preserving holes), and filling didn't handle horizontal spans or middle zero blocks (rows 10-14 have isolated 6-pattern then 3/6 mixed).
 * Overall: Assumes input height >=w and extracts only top w rows for patterns (may miss vertical extent in taller inputs like ex3's 25 rows). Only uses first 3 patterns, ignoring extras (ex3 has more?). Block/pointy branching works sometimes (ex2) but placements off (no diagonal offsets in pointy, wrong rep counts in upper right). get_patterns replaces too aggressively, losing shape subtleties (e.g., ex3 expected preserves sparse 8s/0s patterns). fill_upper_pointy/fill_lower_pointy incomplete (e.g., lower pointy only places second pattern horizontally, missing first/third). No handling for seed_row beyond w rows or uneven panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It repeats a 1-pattern (w=5, sparse 1s like a cross/diamond) across ~20 upper rows with no integration or offsets (just vertical/horizontal tiles of 1s, 3s bottom-right), then a partial 4-pattern (striped 4s/0s) in lower 5 rows, leaving middle/right sparse. This ignores expected integration like ex3 (e.g., no color mixing across panels, no zero separators, no pointy offsets); likely p0 not block so pointy mode, but filling buggy (reps too many/simplistic). It resembles ex3 generated (repetitive, non-integrated), suggesting same extraction/fill flaws: over-tiling without shape preservation or section boundaries. Test likely expects blended 1/3/4 patterns with zeros/holes (e.g., upper pointy with 4 right-spanning 1 left, lower mixed 3/1 with 4 stripes offset), but generated is disjoint/empty in places (e.g., many 0s right, no full s=25 coverage).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a small input grid containing colored patterns (non-zero, non-5 cells) separated by vertical "walls" (columns with 5s, detected in the top row) is analyzed to extract up to 3 panel patterns of equal width (w), each with a representative color from a "seed row" (the lowest row with meaningful content). These patterns are then rearranged and tiled into a larger w x w super-grid (s = w^2 rows/cols) using one of two modes: "block mode" if the first pattern (p0) is a solid block (fully non-zero rows), or "pointy mode" otherwise, involving specific placements of p0, p1, and p2 across super-rows and super-columns, with padding for fewer than 3 panels.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly columns where the top row (g[0]) has a 5; panels start immediately after each wall (or at 0), and w is the distance from a panel start to the next wall (or end of grid).
 * Up to 3 panels (m = min(3, len(starts))); if fewer, pad with empty (all-0) patterns and color 0.
 * Seed row is the last (bottom-most) row with any non-0, non-5 cells; panel colors are sampled from the center column (starts[k] + w//2) of that row.
 * Pattern extraction in get_patterns is complex and error-prone: it scans from top (r=0 to w-1, but input grid may be taller/shorter?), identifies "wall rows" within a panel if > w//2 cells are 5s, then fills wall rows with color[k] except center (0), and non-wall rows with color[k] only where input has non-0/non-5, else 0. This seems to "colorize" sparse patterns but may over/under-fill based on input density.
 * Block detection (is_block) checks if every row in a pattern has exactly w non-zero cells (full width filled); subtle: this assumes patterns are w x w, but input rows may not align perfectly.
 * In block mode (if p0 is block): For each super-row i (0 to w-1), place p1 in super-col i, and p2 in all super-cols i+1 to w-1 of that super-row; additionally, overlay p0 at the bottom-left super position (super-row w-1, super-col 0). This creates a staggered fill but may overwrite if not careful (code doesn't handle overlaps explicitly).
 * In pointy mode (default): For super-rows 0 to w-2, place p2 in super-col 0 (left) and p0 in super-col w-1 (right); for the bottom super-row (w-1), place p1 across super-cols 0 to w-2 (horizontal band, excluding rightmost). Subtle: no placement in bottom-right, left as 0s; assumes "pointy" refers to triangular/pointed arrangements.
 * Output is always s x s (s=w^2), with super-tiling (each super-cell is a w x w pattern block).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid -> empty output; w=0 -> all-0 s x s with s=n_cols^2 (fallback, but unclear); input taller than w? Patterns only take first w rows? (code caps at w but pads with 0s if short).
 * Colors are per-panel but applied uniformly within patterns; 0s are background/empty.
 * Subtlety in wall row detection: Counts 5s per panel slice (starts[k] to starts[k]+w-1), but only if > w//2; this may misclassify dense 5s as walls incorrectly if input has horizontal walls.
 * Patterns may not capture full input height; code forces w x w by taking r in 0 to w-1 from input rows 0+, but input may have patterns spanning more/less.
 * Padding empty patterns to 3 affects mode: empty p0 (all 0s) is not a block, so defaults to pointy mode, which may not match cases with fewer panels.
 * No rotation, flipping, or scaling of patterns; direct copy-placement.
 * Input may have multiple seed rows or varying densities; center color sampling assumes odd/even w handles center correctly (w//2 integer div).

The get_patterns function is overly complex and likely buggy (tries to reconstruct patterns by filling with colors based on wall detection per row, but doesn't copy input faithfully; it sets to color[k] in specific cases, leading to over-coloring). Not helpful as-is—better to copy input slices directly and then apply colors only to non-0/non-5. The main program function orchestrates tiling but has mode-specific placement logic that works for simple cases but fails on integrated patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Successfully extracted panels, computed w/colors/modes, and tiled in block/pointy modes for uniform/simple patterns (e.g., solid blocks or pointy arrangements without overlaps/misalignments).
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated repeating 5x5 blocks of a 6-pattern (alternating rows of full 6s and pointy 6s) in the left super-section (rows 0-19, cols 0-19), with misplaced 3-pattern fragments in bottom-right of that section (e.g., rows 20-24 have 3s but shifted/incomplete), and a separate 8-checkerboard-like pattern in rows 20-24 cols 0-19 (but actually rows 20-24 are all 8-pattern, overwriting?). Expected integrates 8s directly into the 6-pattern blocks (e.g., row 0 has 6s then full 8s from col 5; row 1 has 6s then 8-checker starting col 6), with lower super-rows (e.g., 5-9) having isolated 6-patterns without 8s, mid-section (10-14) plain 6s, and bottom (15-24) mixing 3s and 6s in pointy/block style but with 8s absent. Difference: Generated separates patterns into disjoint blocks without integration/overlays; expected blends 8-pattern into upper 6-blocks (perhaps p2=8 overlays p0/p1=6 in specific positions), and lower sections use different panel combos (e.g., p1=3, p0/p2=6 without 8s). Unknown why: Likely mode detection wrong (is p0 a block here? Generated uses pointy? But output looks blocky-repeating), or pattern extraction fills too uniformly without preserving input sparsity.
 * Fallback for w=0 creates all-0 grid sized to n_cols^2, but untested—may not apply.
 * Padding to 3 empty patterns forces pointy mode if p0 empty (not block), which may mismatch cases with 2 panels.
 * get_patterns over-applies colors (e.g., sets entire non-wall rows to color if any non-0/non-5, but code only sets if cell !=0 and !=5, else 0; still, wall rows set to color except center 0, which may invent patterns not in input).
 * Tiling in block mode places p1 per super-row i in col i, p2 in i+1:, but adds p0 only at fixed bottom-left—may not cover all if w>2, and no overlap resolution.
 * Pointy mode leaves bottom-right empty, but in train3 generated, it filled with 3s/8s incorrectly, suggesting mode mis-trigger or extra placements.
 * Overall, core panel extraction (walls, starts, w, colors, seed) works for train1/2; tiling logic partially works but fails integration in train3 (generated has no 8s in upper 6s, wrong 3-placement, extra 8-block at bottom).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It repeats a 1-pattern (similar to the 6-pointy in train3: alternating full rows of 1s and pointy 1s) across left super-section (rows 0-19, cols 0-19) with 3-fragments misplaced in bottom-right there (e.g., row 20 has full 3s but shifted), then a 4-pattern (alternating full 4 rows and pointy 4 rows, like a striped checker) in rows 20-24 cols 0-19, but abruptly cuts off without integrating into a full s=25 grid (wait, it shows only up to row 24, but placements suggest w=5, s=25). This mirrors train3 error: Disjoint repeating blocks without blending (e.g., no 4s overlaying 1s or 3s in expected pointy/block style), and 3s appear as a separate bottom band but incomplete/fragmented (e.g., row 1 has 1s then 3s starting col 20?). Expected likely similar to train3: Upper super-rows blend panels (e.g., 1-pattern with 4-checker integrated like 6+8), mid/lower use 1+3 combos without 4s, bottom horizontal 3-band or mixed. Why incorrect: Same issues as train3—pattern extraction probably over-fills 1/4 to solid/pointy without input fidelity, mode likely pointy (repeating left/right placements), but no overlays; 3s from p1? but placed wrong. Does not make sense: Lacks the subtle integrations/omissions seen in expected train3 (e.g., some super-blocks are pure one pattern, others blended), and the 4-pattern at bottom looks like an extra unintended block rather than tiled super.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input generated output:
[0]
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 08:48:38] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a input grid (likely representing a composite image or pattern with colored blocks separated by empty space or markers like 5s) is transformed into a smaller square output grid of size w x w (where w is derived from bottom row spacing), by extracting small w x w binary patterns centered on colored blobs in the bottom row, assigning them to categories A, B, C based on colors, and then tiling/rearranging these patterns in the output according to specific layout rules that vary by mode ('block' vs 'pointy') and simplicity (e.g., whether the top pattern has edges clear).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The bottom row determines centers of colored blobs (non-zero runs), with up to 3 centers used; w is 1 if single center, else min spacing minus 1; extra centers beyond 3 are extrapolated from previous diffs.
 * First section height is the first row with > n_cols//2 fives (5s act as horizontal separators to isolate the top pattern area, ignoring lower sections).
 * Patterns are extracted as w x w binary (1 for non-0/5, 0 otherwise) from the top section, centered on each center col, padded/truncated to w.
 * Mode detection: If first pattern (C?) is a full block (all rows sum to w), use 'block' mode with specific A/B/C assignments; else 'pointy' mode, and check if simple (top row of first pattern has 0s at edges).
 * In 'block' or non-simple 'pointy': Output is tiled diagonally or in rows with A on diagonal, B off-diagonal above, C at bottom-left.
 * In simple 'pointy': Special L-shaped tiling with A on left, right_pat on right, bottom_pat on bottom.
 * Non-simple 'pointy' has a more complex triangular/pyramid tiling: upper half rows have A left + decreasing B's right; lower half has increasing C's left + decreasing A's right (with half calculations for even/odd w).
 * Colors are taken from bottom row at centers and applied when placing patterns (overwriting 0s where 1 in pattern).
 * Subtle: Extraction ignores 5s as 0 in binary; patterns padded below if top section < w high; output init to 0s, size w*w x w*w; assumes up to 3 colors/blobs, but handles fewer.
 * Easy to miss: Separator rows (many 5s) split sections, so only top section used for patterns; extrapolation for missing centers; rounding avg for center pos; mode flips A/B/C assignments; simple mode only triggers in pointy and changes to right/bottom specific pats; test inputs may have no centers (output [[0]]? but [0] suggests bug); w=0 or edge cases lead to tiny outputs.
 * All attempts assume grid is rectangular, non-empty; colors are integers like 3,6,8; output flattens? No, lists of lists.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def find_centers(bottom: List[int], n_cols: int) -> List[int]:
    centers = []
    i = 0
    while i < n_cols:
        if bottom[i] == 0:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        while i < n_cols and bottom[i] != 0:
            i += 1
        avg = (start + i - 1) / 2
        centers.append(round(avg))
    return centers[:3]
```
(This finds blob centers by averaging start/end of non-zero runs in bottom row, caps at 3—helpful for locating A/B/C positions.)

```python
def find_first_section_height(g: List[List[int]], n_cols: int) -> int:
    n_rows = len(g)
    seps = []
    for r in range(n_rows):
        num_fives = sum(1 for v in g[r] if v == 5)
        if num_fives > n_cols // 2:
            seps.append(r)
    return seps[0] if seps else n_rows
```
(This detects the first major separator row with >half 5s to limit top pattern extraction—key for ignoring lower grid sections.)

```python
def extract_pattern(g: List[List[int]], center: int, w: int, first_h: int, n_cols: int, n_rows: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pat = []
    win_start = max(0, center - w // 2)
    win_end = min(n_cols, center + w // 2 + 1)
    for r in range(min(first_h, n_rows)):
        row_slice = g[r][win_start:win_end]
        bin_row = [1 if cell not in (0, 5) else 0 for cell in row_slice]
        if len(bin_row) < w:
            bin_row += [0] * (w - len(bin_row))
        else:
            bin_row = bin_row[:w]
        pat.append(bin_row)
    while len(pat) < w:
        pat.append([0] * w)
    return pat
```
(This extracts a centered w x w binary pattern from top section, treating 0/5 as empty—essential for getting A/B/C shapes.)

```python
def is_block(pat: List[List[int]], w: int) -> bool:
    return all(sum(row) == w for row in pat)
```
(Checks if a pattern is a solid full-width block—triggers mode switch.)

```python
def place_pattern(out: List[List[int]], r0: int, c0: int, pat: List[List[int]], colr: int, w: int):
    for rr in range(w):
        for cc in range(w):
            if pat[rr][cc] == 1:
                out[r0 + rr][c0 + cc] = colr
```
(Overlays a colored pattern onto output at offset—core for building the final grid.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, likely due to accurate center finding, pattern extraction, and basic tiling for simpler 'block' or non-complex 'pointy' cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in lower sections (rows 5-10 have extra 8s spilling into right/bottom where expected has 0s; rows 11-15 have patterns but expected has isolated 6-blobs without full 8-background; rows 16-25 similar but with misplaced 6/8 overlaps and missing 0-regions). Upper rows 0-4 match perfectly, suggesting top pattern/mode detection works but tiling logic fails for this case (possibly wrong mode, simple flag, or half-calcs in non-simple pointy leading to over-placement of 8s).
 * What worked: Center detection, w calc from diffs, first_h via 5-separators, binary extraction ignoring 5/0, color assignment from bottom, basic block mode tiling, simple pointy L-shape.
 * What didn't: Non-simple pointy tiling overfills with B/C patterns (e.g., num_b/num_c calcs wrong for w=5? leading to extra placements); possible bug in pat assignments (A/B/C swapped?); for 3 centers, extrapolation unused but maybe needed; output size s=w*w correct but placements ignore boundaries.
 * Function find_centers is helpful and accurate for blob positioning.
 * Function extract_pattern is helpful but subtle padding/trunc might cause edge mismatches if center near bounds.
 * Function is_block is helpful for mode but may misclassify if patterns have partial fills.
 * place_pattern is essential and correct for overlay.
 * Overall, core extraction works (passes 2/3 trains), but tiling rules incomplete for complex pointy (unknown why row 5+ differ—possibly half=w//2=2 misplaces in pyramid layout).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is [0], a single row with one 0, which does not make sense or look correct—likely a bug (e.g., n_rows=0 early return mishandled, or no centers found leading to [[0]] but flattened wrong; expected probably a small patterned grid like [[color]] or w=1 block). This fails to demonstrate understanding for edge cases (empty/single cell? no blobs?), suggesting program crashes or defaults poorly on test input; must handle zero centers explicitly without tiny invalid output.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 08:48:38] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid (likely representing layered or evolving patterns of colored blocks or shapes separated by dividers like 5s) is transformed into a square output grid by extracting, possibly inverting or swapping, and tiling specific pattern segments based on "centers" and colors identified in the bottom row of the input. The output seems to build a larger composite image by repeating or shifting these patterns vertically and horizontally, potentially simulating stacking or evolution of objects across sections divided by horizontal separators.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The bottom row contains key "centers" (groups of consecutive non-zero values representing object positions/colors), with widths derived from minimum differences between centers minus one; limit to up to 3 centers, padding if fewer, and handle dummy centers with color 0.
 * Horizontal separators (rows with many 5s, > half columns) divide the grid into sections; the first section's height (up to first separator or full height) determines pattern extraction depth, assumed to equal width w.
 * Patterns are extracted as binary (1 for non-0/non-5, 0 otherwise) from local windows around each center (±w//2), truncated/padded to exactly w length; these represent shapes of left/mid/right objects.
 * "Used" colors in the first section determine swapping: if right color appears early, use mid for main block and right for tiling; detect "swap mode" if left-top pattern starts/ends empty (suggesting inversion or shift).
 * Special inversion rule: for right-sourced blocks, if middle row has only center 1, invert the pattern (flip 0s/1s).
 * Tiling in output (size w*w): left block (cols 0 to w-1) from selected source (left/right/mid based on mode/used), repeated vertically (mod first_h); right tiling starts at col w (or later with empties in swap mode), places (w-1) tiles of the remaining pattern horizontally, filling only where pattern has 1s, without wrapping beyond size.
 * Subtleties: Output is square but input may be rectangular/tall; handle edge cases like no centers (all-zero output), multiple groups in bottom, or asymmetric windows (max(0,start) to min(n_cols,end)); middle row special cases (e.g., only-center inversion) suggest shape evolution or symmetry rules; dividers (5s) are ignored in patterns but define sections; colors are preserved from bottom centers; test inputs may have more sections or larger widths, leading to all-zero if centers not detected.
 * Potential misses: Full grid may have multiple sections beyond first (e.g., training 3 shows evolving patterns downward), requiring sequential processing or stacking; inversion might apply more broadly; tiling may shift positions (e.g., expected shows left-shifted blocks with leading 0s); w calculation assumes uniform spacing but may vary; dummy padding affects colors but not positions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def find_centers(bottom: List[int], n_cols: int) -> List[int]:
    """Extract rounded average positions of consecutive non-0 groups in bottom row."""
    centers = []
    i = 0
    while i < n_cols:
        if bottom[i] == 0:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        while i < n_cols and bottom[i] != 0:
            i += 1

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt correctly identifies centers via grouping consecutive non-0s in bottom and computes w as min diff -1, which works for uniform spacing but fails if diffs vary or groups overlap.
 * Pattern extraction as binary around centers (±w//2 window) is helpful and captures shapes accurately for first section, but ignores later sections (e.g., training 3 expected evolves patterns downward with new colors like 6->3, leading to incomplete stacking).
 * Swap mode detection (left-top empty at edges) and used-color check (right_color in first section) partially work for deciding sources (left/mid/right), but misapplies: in training 1, generates repeating 7/1 without left-shifting to 0-padded 7/1 in mid section, and misses bottom 6 introduction.
 * Inversion logic for right block (middle row only-center -> flip) is subtle but incorrectly applied or absent in outputs: training 1 generated no inversion, resulting in solid blocks instead of expected sparse 7/0/7 patterns.
 * Tiling logic places main block left and tiles rightward, but bugs in start position (e.g., w + num_empty*w in swap, or simple w otherwise) and loop (w-1 tiles without full coverage) cause underfilling: training 1 tiles only partial 1s without full row replication; training 2 repeats 3/7 but misses bottom 9 full row and sparse 9/0/9.
 * First section height detection via 5-separators works but assumes first_h == w (untrue in larger grids like training 3, where w~5 but sections taller, leading to mod first_h wrapping incorrectly).
 * Padding centers to 3 with dummies (color 0) is attempted but breaks if g_num <3, as bottom padding assumes extra cols (causes index errors or wrong colors).
 * Overall, program handles small uniform cases partially (e.g., detects colors 7/1/6) but fails multi-section evolution (training 3 generated endless repetition of top patterns instead of descending 8->0->6->3 with shifts); no handling for output size beyond w*w assumption.
 * Function to compute diffs/w is helpful but min(diffs)-1 assumes spacing >1; broken if g_num<2 (no diffs, crashes).
 * No extraction for full grid objects beyond first section; a broader extract_objects would be essential but missing, leading to static outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is all zeros across a 16x30 grid (non-square, unlike w*w logic), which does not look correct as it suggests no patterns detected (likely zero centers in bottom or g_num==0 early return), but expected should derive from test input's bottom centers/patterns (test input not shown, but implies non-empty grid with potential w~5-6 based on training scales).
 * All-zero output ignores any input structure, missing tiling/shifting (e.g., if test has multiple sections like training 3, should stack evolved patterns with colors from bottom groups); this indicates failure to handle large/variable widths or absent separators.
 * Output dimensions (16 rows, 30 cols) mismatch square assumption, suggesting program didn't compute w correctly or truncated; expected likely a square subsection or full transform with shifts/0-padding as in training 1's mid/bottom sections.
 * No colors or patterns appear, confirming broken center detection or pattern extraction for this input (possibly wider bottom groups or no non-0s, but unlikely for puzzle test).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains vertical wall columns (marked by 5s in the top row) that divide the grid into panels of equal width w, each panel featuring a colored pattern (non-zero cells of a specific color, with 0s as empty space and 5s as walls). The goal is to generate a larger square output grid of size s x s (where s = w * w) by extracting the first three patterns, determining if the first is a "block" (solid full-width non-zeros), and then tiling/combining these patterns into upper and lower sections using either block-style (repetitive horizontal/vertical copies) or pointy-style (diagonal or offset placements) arrangements, incorporating colors from a seed row (last non-empty row).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly columns where the top row (row 0) has a 5; panels start right after each wall and span to the next wall or end, with all panels assumed equal width w (computed from first panel).
 * Colors are sampled from the center of each panel in the seed row (last row with any non-0/non-5 cells); patterns are extracted by replacing non-wall/non-zero cells with the panel's color and handling wall rows specially (e.g., center 0, sides color if blocky).
 * Only the first three panels (m >= 3 assumed) are used; if fewer, output is zeroed grid.
 * Block detection: A pattern is a "block" if every row has exactly w non-zero cells (full width); this decides between block filling (repetitive copies, e.g., (w-1) vertical reps of patterns in upper, horizontal in lower) vs. pointy filling (offset or mirrored placements, e.g., third pattern left in upper pointy, first right).
 * Upper block: (w-1) vertical reps of second pattern left, (w-1) vertical reps of third with (w-1) horizontal shifts right.
 * Lower block: First pattern left, second pattern right-shifted.
 * Upper pointy: (w-1) vertical reps of third left, (w-1) vertical reps of first right-shifted.
 * Lower pointy: First? Wait, code has second with (w-1) horizontal left, but may be incomplete/misordered.
 * Subtlety: Patterns may have internal structure (e.g., holes or shapes like diamonds), and filling must preserve this while tiling; walls (5s) in input are ignored in output except for defining panels.
 * Seed row is bottom-up search for last row with non-0/non-5; if all empty, defaults to 0 (may cause issues if no content).
 * Output is always s x s zeros init, filled only in upper (first w*(w-1) rows) and lower (last w rows); middle may remain zero if not filled.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal repetitions in right sections are (w-1) copies side-by-side; pointy may imply diagonal offsets not fully captured in code (e.g., ex1 expected has zeroed middle in upper). Assume w prime or fixed per example (3 for ex1, 5 for ex3/test). Handle m<3 by zero grid, but examples have m>=3.
 * Patterns replace 5s/0s with color only if non-wall row; wall rows (majority 5s) get special treatment (center 0, sides color).
 * Global: Input may have trailing empty panels or uneven widths (but code assumes equal); output colors must match input exactly, no blending.

    return all(sum(1 for x in row if x != 0) == w for row in pattern)

(The fill functions like fill_upper_block, fill_lower_block, etc., are partially helpful for tiling logic but buggy in placement/offset for pointy/block variants, as seen in mismatches.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (w=3, colors 7/1/6?): Used block filling (assuming p0 block), but upper section mismatched: generated repeated 7s/1s vertically without zeroed middle transition (rows 3-5 all filled with 7s/1s, but expected has zeros left/middle in rows 3-5 with 7s/1s right); lower matched expected 6s/0s/7s. Block detection likely correct, but upper filling didn't insert zero separator or offset properly.
 * Training example 2: Fully correct, so panel extraction, color sampling, and filling logic worked for that case (likely block or pointy matched exactly).
 * Training example 3 (w=5, colors 6/3/8?): Used pointy filling (p0 not block), but generated massive repetition of 6-pattern upper (20 rows of tiled 6s with 3s bottom-right, ignoring integration) and incomplete 8s lower; expected integrates 6/8/3 across sections with offsets (e.g., row 0 has 6s left + 8s right spanning panels, row 5 has 8s full right but zeros middle, lower has mixed 3/6 with 0s). Patterns extracted wrong (over-replaced 0s/5s without preserving holes), and filling didn't handle horizontal spans or middle zero blocks (rows 10-14 have isolated 6-pattern then 3/6 mixed).
 * Overall: Assumes input height >=w and extracts only top w rows for patterns (may miss vertical extent in taller inputs like ex3's 25 rows). Only uses first 3 patterns, ignoring extras (ex3 has more?). Block/pointy branching works sometimes (ex2) but placements off (no diagonal offsets in pointy, wrong rep counts in upper right). get_patterns replaces too aggressively, losing shape subtleties (e.g., ex3 expected preserves sparse 8s/0s patterns). fill_upper_pointy/fill_lower_pointy incomplete (e.g., lower pointy only places second pattern horizontally, missing first/third). No handling for seed_row beyond w rows or uneven panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It repeats a 1-pattern (w=5, sparse 1s like a cross/diamond) across ~20 upper rows with no integration or offsets (just vertical/horizontal tiles of 1s, 3s bottom-right), then a partial 4-pattern (striped 4s/0s) in lower 5 rows, leaving middle/right sparse. This ignores expected integration like ex3 (e.g., no color mixing across panels, no zero separators, no pointy offsets); likely p0 not block so pointy mode, but filling buggy (reps too many/simplistic). It resembles ex3 generated (repetitive, non-integrated), suggesting same extraction/fill flaws: over-tiling without shape preservation or section boundaries. Test likely expects blended 1/3/4 patterns with zeros/holes (e.g., upper pointy with 4 right-spanning 1 left, lower mixed 3/1 with 4 stripes offset), but generated is disjoint/empty in places (e.g., many 0s right, no full s=25 coverage).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a small input grid containing colored patterns (non-zero, non-5 cells) separated by vertical "walls" (columns with 5s, detected in the top row) is analyzed to extract up to 3 panel patterns of equal width (w), each with a representative color from a "seed row" (the lowest row with meaningful content). These patterns are then rearranged and tiled into a larger w x w super-grid (s = w^2 rows/cols) using one of two modes: "block mode" if the first pattern (p0) is a solid block (fully non-zero rows), or "pointy mode" otherwise, involving specific placements of p0, p1, and p2 across super-rows and super-columns, with padding for fewer than 3 panels.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are strictly columns where the top row (g[0]) has a 5; panels start immediately after each wall (or at 0), and w is the distance from a panel start to the next wall (or end of grid).
 * Up to 3 panels (m = min(3, len(starts))); if fewer, pad with empty (all-0) patterns and color 0.
 * Seed row is the last (bottom-most) row with any non-0, non-5 cells; panel colors are sampled from the center column (starts[k] + w//2) of that row.
 * Pattern extraction in get_patterns is complex and error-prone: it scans from top (r=0 to w-1, but input grid may be taller/shorter?), identifies "wall rows" within a panel if > w//2 cells are 5s, then fills wall rows with color[k] except center (0), and non-wall rows with color[k] only where input has non-0/non-5, else 0. This seems to "colorize" sparse patterns but may over/under-fill based on input density.
 * Block detection (is_block) checks if every row in a pattern has exactly w non-zero cells (full width filled); subtle: this assumes patterns are w x w, but input rows may not align perfectly.
 * In block mode (if p0 is block): For each super-row i (0 to w-1), place p1 in super-col i, and p2 in all super-cols i+1 to w-1 of that super-row; additionally, overlay p0 at the bottom-left super position (super-row w-1, super-col 0). This creates a staggered fill but may overwrite if not careful (code doesn't handle overlaps explicitly).
 * In pointy mode (default): For super-rows 0 to w-2, place p2 in super-col 0 (left) and p0 in super-col w-1 (right); for the bottom super-row (w-1), place p1 across super-cols 0 to w-2 (horizontal band, excluding rightmost). Subtle: no placement in bottom-right, left as 0s; assumes "pointy" refers to triangular/pointed arrangements.
 * Output is always s x s (s=w^2), with super-tiling (each super-cell is a w x w pattern block).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid -> empty output; w=0 -> all-0 s x s with s=n_cols^2 (fallback, but unclear); input taller than w? Patterns only take first w rows? (code caps at w but pads with 0s if short).
 * Colors are per-panel but applied uniformly within patterns; 0s are background/empty.
 * Subtlety in wall row detection: Counts 5s per panel slice (starts[k] to starts[k]+w-1), but only if > w//2; this may misclassify dense 5s as walls incorrectly if input has horizontal walls.
 * Patterns may not capture full input height; code forces w x w by taking r in 0 to w-1 from input rows 0+, but input may have patterns spanning more/less.
 * Padding empty patterns to 3 affects mode: empty p0 (all 0s) is not a block, so defaults to pointy mode, which may not match cases with fewer panels.
 * No rotation, flipping, or scaling of patterns; direct copy-placement.
 * Input may have multiple seed rows or varying densities; center color sampling assumes odd/even w handles center correctly (w//2 integer div).

The get_patterns function is overly complex and likely buggy (tries to reconstruct patterns by filling with colors based on wall detection per row, but doesn't copy input faithfully; it sets to color[k] in specific cases, leading to over-coloring). Not helpful as-is—better to copy input slices directly and then apply colors only to non-0/non-5. The main program function orchestrates tiling but has mode-specific placement logic that works for simple cases but fails on integrated patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 and 2 correct: Successfully extracted panels, computed w/colors/modes, and tiled in block/pointy modes for uniform/simple patterns (e.g., solid blocks or pointy arrangements without overlaps/misalignments).
 * Training 3 incorrect: Generated repeating 5x5 blocks of a 6-pattern (alternating rows of full 6s and pointy 6s) in the left super-section (rows 0-19, cols 0-19), with misplaced 3-pattern fragments in bottom-right of that section (e.g., rows 20-24 have 3s but shifted/incomplete), and a separate 8-checkerboard-like pattern in rows 20-24 cols 0-19 (but actually rows 20-24 are all 8-pattern, overwriting?). Expected integrates 8s directly into the 6-pattern blocks (e.g., row 0 has 6s then full 8s from col 5; row 1 has 6s then 8-checker starting col 6), with lower super-rows (e.g., 5-9) having isolated 6-patterns without 8s, mid-section (10-14) plain 6s, and bottom (15-24) mixing 3s and 6s in pointy/block style but with 8s absent. Difference: Generated separates patterns into disjoint blocks without integration/overlays; expected blends 8-pattern into upper 6-blocks (perhaps p2=8 overlays p0/p1=6 in specific positions), and lower sections use different panel combos (e.g., p1=3, p0/p2=6 without 8s). Unknown why: Likely mode detection wrong (is p0 a block here? Generated uses pointy? But output looks blocky-repeating), or pattern extraction fills too uniformly without preserving input sparsity.
 * Fallback for w=0 creates all-0 grid sized to n_cols^2, but untested—may not apply.
 * Padding to 3 empty patterns forces pointy mode if p0 empty (not block), which may mismatch cases with 2 panels.
 * get_patterns over-applies colors (e.g., sets entire non-wall rows to color if any non-0/non-5, but code only sets if cell !=0 and !=5, else 0; still, wall rows set to color except center 0, which may invent patterns not in input).
 * Tiling in block mode places p1 per super-row i in col i, p2 in i+1:, but adds p0 only at fixed bottom-left—may not cover all if w>2, and no overlap resolution.
 * Pointy mode leaves bottom-right empty, but in train3 generated, it filled with 3s/8s incorrectly, suggesting mode mis-trigger or extra placements.
 * Overall, core panel extraction (walls, starts, w, colors, seed) works for train1/2; tiling logic partially works but fails integration in train3 (generated has no 8s in upper 6s, wrong 3-placement, extra 8-block at bottom).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It repeats a 1-pattern (similar to the 6-pointy in train3: alternating full rows of 1s and pointy 1s) across left super-section (rows 0-19, cols 0-19) with 3-fragments misplaced in bottom-right there (e.g., row 20 has full 3s but shifted), then a 4-pattern (alternating full 4 rows and pointy 4 rows, like a striped checker) in rows 20-24 cols 0-19, but abruptly cuts off without integrating into a full s=25 grid (wait, it shows only up to row 24, but placements suggest w=5, s=25). This mirrors train3 error: Disjoint repeating blocks without blending (e.g., no 4s overlaying 1s or 3s in expected pointy/block style), and 3s appear as a separate bottom band but incomplete/fragmented (e.g., row 1 has 1s then 3s starting col 20?). Expected likely similar to train3: Upper super-rows blend panels (e.g., 1-pattern with 4-checker integrated like 6+8), mid/lower use 1+3 combos without 4s, bottom horizontal 3-band or mixed. Why incorrect: Same issues as train3—pattern extraction probably over-fills 1/4 to solid/pointy without input fidelity, mode likely pointy (repeating left/right placements), but no overlays; 3s from p1? but placed wrong. Does not make sense: Lacks the subtle integrations/omissions seen in expected train3 (e.g., some super-blocks are pure one pattern, others blended), and the 4-pattern at bottom looks like an extra unintended block rather than tiled super.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a input grid (likely representing a composite image or pattern with colored blocks separated by empty space or markers like 5s) is transformed into a smaller square output grid of size w x w (where w is derived from bottom row spacing), by extracting small w x w binary patterns centered on colored blobs in the bottom row, assigning them to categories A, B, C based on colors, and then tiling/rearranging these patterns in the output according to specific layout rules that vary by mode ('block' vs 'pointy') and simplicity (e.g., whether the top pattern has edges clear).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The bottom row determines centers of colored blobs (non-zero runs), with up to 3 centers used; w is 1 if single center, else min spacing minus 1; extra centers beyond 3 are extrapolated from previous diffs.
 * First section height is the first row with > n_cols//2 fives (5s act as horizontal separators to isolate the top pattern area, ignoring lower sections).
 * Patterns are extracted as w x w binary (1 for non-0/5, 0 otherwise) from the top section, centered on each center col, padded/truncated to w.
 * Mode detection: If first pattern (C?) is a full block (all rows sum to w), use 'block' mode with specific A/B/C assignments; else 'pointy' mode, and check if simple (top row of first pattern has 0s at edges).
 * In 'block' or non-simple 'pointy': Output is tiled diagonally or in rows with A on diagonal, B off-diagonal above, C at bottom-left.
 * In simple 'pointy': Special L-shaped tiling with A on left, right_pat on right, bottom_pat on bottom.
 * Non-simple 'pointy' has a more complex triangular/pyramid tiling: upper half rows have A left + decreasing B's right; lower half has increasing C's left + decreasing A's right (with half calculations for even/odd w).
 * Colors are taken from bottom row at centers and applied when placing patterns (overwriting 0s where 1 in pattern).
 * Subtle: Extraction ignores 5s as 0 in binary; patterns padded below if top section < w high; output init to 0s, size w*w x w*w; assumes up to 3 colors/blobs, but handles fewer.
 * Easy to miss: Separator rows (many 5s) split sections, so only top section used for patterns; extrapolation for missing centers; rounding avg for center pos; mode flips A/B/C assignments; simple mode only triggers in pointy and changes to right/bottom specific pats; test inputs may have no centers (output [[0]]? but [0] suggests bug); w=0 or edge cases lead to tiny outputs.
 * All attempts assume grid is rectangular, non-empty; colors are integers like 3,6,8; output flattens? No, lists of lists.

        start = i
        while i < n_cols and bottom[i] != 0:
            i += 1
        avg = (start + i - 1) / 2
        centers.append(round(avg))
    return centers[:3]
```
(This finds blob centers by averaging start/end of non-zero runs in bottom row, caps at 3—helpful for locating A/B/C positions.)

```python
def find_first_section_height(g: List[List[int]], n_cols: int) -> int:
    n_rows = len(g)
    seps = []
    for r in range(n_rows):
        num_fives = sum(1 for v in g[r] if v == 5)
        if num_fives > n_cols // 2:
            seps.append(r)
    return seps[0] if seps else n_rows
```
(This detects the first major separator row with >half 5s to limit top pattern extraction—key for ignoring lower grid sections.)

```python
def extract_pattern(g: List[List[int]], center: int, w: int, first_h: int, n_cols: int, n_rows: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pat = []
    win_start = max(0, center - w // 2)
    win_end = min(n_cols, center + w // 2 + 1)
    for r in range(min(first_h, n_rows)):
        row_slice = g[r][win_start:win_end]
        bin_row = [1 if cell not in (0, 5) else 0 for cell in row_slice]
        if len(bin_row) < w:
            bin_row += [0] * (w - len(bin_row))
        else:
            bin_row = bin_row[:w]
        pat.append(bin_row)
    while len(pat) < w:
        pat.append([0] * w)
    return pat
```
(This extracts a centered w x w binary pattern from top section, treating 0/5 as empty—essential for getting A/B/C shapes.)

```python
def is_block(pat: List[List[int]], w: int) -> bool:
    return all(sum(row) == w for row in pat)
```
(Checks if a pattern is a solid full-width block—triggers mode switch.)

```python
def place_pattern(out: List[List[int]], r0: int, c0: int, pat: List[List[int]], colr: int, w: int):
    for rr in range(w):
        for cc in range(w):
            if pat[rr][cc] == 1:
                out[r0 + rr][c0 + cc] = colr
```
(Overlays a colored pattern onto output at offset—core for building the final grid.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, likely due to accurate center finding, pattern extraction, and basic tiling for simpler 'block' or non-complex 'pointy' cases.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output mismatches expected in lower sections (rows 5-10 have extra 8s spilling into right/bottom where expected has 0s; rows 11-15 have patterns but expected has isolated 6-blobs without full 8-background; rows 16-25 similar but with misplaced 6/8 overlaps and missing 0-regions). Upper rows 0-4 match perfectly, suggesting top pattern/mode detection works but tiling logic fails for this case (possibly wrong mode, simple flag, or half-calcs in non-simple pointy leading to over-placement of 8s).
 * What worked: Center detection, w calc from diffs, first_h via 5-separators, binary extraction ignoring 5/0, color assignment from bottom, basic block mode tiling, simple pointy L-shape.
 * What didn't: Non-simple pointy tiling overfills with B/C patterns (e.g., num_b/num_c calcs wrong for w=5? leading to extra placements); possible bug in pat assignments (A/B/C swapped?); for 3 centers, extrapolation unused but maybe needed; output size s=w*w correct but placements ignore boundaries.
 * Function find_centers is helpful and accurate for blob positioning.
 * Function extract_pattern is helpful but subtle padding/trunc might cause edge mismatches if center near bounds.
 * Function is_block is helpful for mode but may misclassify if patterns have partial fills.
 * place_pattern is essential and correct for overlay.
 * Overall, core extraction works (passes 2/3 trains), but tiling rules incomplete for complex pointy (unknown why row 5+ differ—possibly half=w//2=2 misplaces in pyramid layout).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is [0], a single row with one 0, which does not make sense or look correct—likely a bug (e.g., n_rows=0 early return mishandled, or no centers found leading to [[0]] but flattened wrong; expected probably a small patterned grid like [[color]] or w=1 block). This fails to demonstrate understanding for edge cases (empty/single cell? no blobs?), suggesting program crashes or defaults poorly on test input; must handle zero centers explicitly without tiny invalid output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 09:02:44] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid with walls (marked by 5s in columns) that divide it into panels of width w, extracting patterns (binary representations of non-empty/non-wall cells) and colors (from a seed row) from up to 3 panels, then composing a larger s x s output grid (s = w * w) by placing these patterns in a structured "block" or "pointy" mode layout, potentially with swapping based on edge conditions, to create a tiled or arranged visual design.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls are vertical columns fully or mostly filled with 5s, separating panels; panel starts are immediately after each wall, and w is the distance from the first panel start to the first wall (or full width if no walls).
 * Patterns are extracted as w x w binary grids (1 for non-0/non-5 cells, 0 otherwise), but if a row has > w/2 fives, treat it as a special "wall row" with 1s everywhere except 0 at center; pad/truncate to exactly w x w.
 * Colors are sampled from the lowest non-empty/non-wall row (seed row) at the center of each panel's first m=3 panels; default to 0 if out of bounds.
 * Output is always s x s with s = w^2; placement uses "super rows/columns" of size w, deciding between "block mode" (if first pattern is a full block of 1s) or "pointy mode" (otherwise), with potential swapping of patterns/colors if the first pattern has an open edge (0 at left or right).
 * In block mode: upper super rows place p1 in left super col and p2 in right super cols; bottom super row places p0 left, p1 right.
 * In pointy mode: upper super rows place p2 left and (swapped p0 or p1) right; bottom super row places (swapped p1 or p0) in left super cols and optionally p2 right if no swap.
 * Subtleties: Only use first min(3, available) panels; pad colors/patterns to 3 with 0s/empty; seed row is the last row with any non-0/non-5; patterns may repeat across panels if similar; output ignores original grid's row count beyond w for patterns.
 * Easy to miss: Wall detection only checks top row for 5s (in find_wall_cols), which may miss partial walls; is_block checks if all rows sum to w (full 1s); is_swap checks if top row of p0 has 0 at ends; placement bounds-checks but doesn't handle original grid rows < w well (pads with 0s).
 * Considerations: Generated output for training 3 repeats upper patterns downward and mangles lower 3-colored section (e.g., full rows of 8s where expected has sparse 8s and 6s mixed); test input has w=5 (no walls?), patterns like cross/diamond in 1s, but output repeats them tiled without mode-specific arrangement, leading to uniform blocks instead of integrated design.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def find_wall_cols(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    n_cols = len(g[0])
    return [j for j in range(n_cols) if g[0][j] == 5]
```
(This detects wall columns by checking only the top row for 5s; useful but may need extension for full-column walls.)

```python
def find_panel_starts(wall_cols: List[int], n_cols: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = [0]
    for wall in wall_cols:
        if wall + 1 < n_cols:
            starts.append(wall + 1)
    return starts
```
(Defines panel starts correctly as 0 and post-wall positions.)

```python
def get_w(starts: List[int], wall_cols: List[int], n_cols: int) -> int:
    if not starts:
        return n_cols
    first_end = wall_cols[0] if wall_cols else n_cols
    return first_end - starts[0]
```
(Computes panel width w accurately as first panel's span.)

```python
def find_seed_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n_rows = len(g)
    for i in range(n_rows - 1, -1, -1):
        if any(cell != 0 and cell != 5 for cell in g[i]):
            return i
    return 0
```
(Finds the last meaningful row for color sampling; helpful for bottom-up priority.)

```python
def is_block(pat: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    if not pat:
        return False
    w = len(pat[0])
    if w == 0:
        return False
    return all(sum(row) == w for row in pat)
```
(Detects full-block patterns to trigger block mode; core for mode decision.)

```python
def is_swap(p0: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    if not p0 or not p0[0]:
        return False
    top = p0[0]
    w = len(top)
    return top[0] == 0 or top[w - 1] == 0
```
(Checks for open edges in first pattern to enable swapping in pointy mode; key subtlety.)

```python
def place(out: List[List[int]], r_start: int, c_start: int, pat: List[List[int]], col: int, w: int):
    for rr in range(w):
        for cc in range(w):
            if pat[rr][cc] == 1:
                if r_start + rr < len(out) and c_start + cc < len(out[0]):
                    out[r_start + rr][c_start + cc] = col
```
(Places patterns by filling 1s with color; bounds-checked, essential for composition.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, likely due to simple wall/panel setups matching block or basic pointy modes without edge cases.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output incorrectly tiles upper 6-patterns (e.g., cross shapes) across all super rows instead of isolating them to upper/lower; lower section has misplaced 8s (full blocks where expected sparse checkerboard-like 8s mixed with 6s and 0s) and ignores 3-colored panel entirely in upper, placing it only fragmented at bottom.
 * In training 3 generated vs. expected: Rows 0-4 match upper 6-pattern closely but expected has extended 8s on right; rows 5-9 have 0-padded lower but generated repeats 6-pattern; rows 10-14 introduce mismatched 6/0 but expected has distinct 6-cross below; rows 15-19 mangle 3/6 mix (e.g., full 8 rows vs. sparse 8/6/0); rows 20-24 completely wrong 3-pattern placement with 6 intrusions where expected has clean 3/6 separation—difference likely from wrong mode (used pointy but expected block?) or swap logic failing on partial walls.
 * extract_objects not present, but pattern extraction in get_patterns is helpful yet buggy: Over-detects walls in slices (five_count > w//2 forces center-0 row, but may misapply to non-wall rows); doesn't handle varying row lengths well.
 * find_wall_cols only checks top row, which worked for train 1/2 but may miss in train 3 if walls aren't top-full (unknown if that's the issue).
 * Block/pointy placement logic partially works (repeats patterns tiled) but fails integration: In pointy mode, right placements use wrong super col starts (hardcoded (w-1)*w instead of varying), leading to overlaps/empties; swap doesn't propagate correctly to bottom row.
 * get_colors and get_patterns pad to 3 correctly, but m=min(3,len(starts)) limits to first panels, which may ignore later ones in train 3's multi-panel setup.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but is_wall in get_patterns is overly simplistic (threshold-based, may false-positive on dense rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it repeats the same 1-pattern (cross/diamond shapes in super rows 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19) tiled across the 25x25 grid (w=5, s=25), with a bottom super row (20-24) placing a full-block 3-pattern left and partial 1 right, but lacks any mode-specific variation or integration.
 * Expected should vary by mode: If block mode (first pattern isn't full block—it's sparse cross, so pointy), upper super rows need p2 (third panel? test has no walls, so single panel repeated?) left and swapped/non-swapped right; bottom needs adjusted left fills and optional p2 right; but generated ignores this, creating uniform repetition instead of a composed design like train 3 expected (mixed colors/patterns).
 * Differences: No color 4 integration beyond bottom (expected likely mixes 1/3/4 across); bottom row has incomplete 1-placement (sparse where expected denser); overall lacks "pointy" staggering or block filling, resulting in empty super columns (all 0s in places) vs. expected filled design; test input has no walls (starts=[0], w=25? but code caps w=5? wait, code assumes w from first panel, but test grid is 25 cols with patterns suggesting w=5 implicit—code may miscompute w=25, but output is 25x25 with small patterns, so w=5 detected somehow? unclear, but tiling is wrong).
 * Test output makes sense as a naive repeat but not as puzzle solution—missing subtle placement offsets/swaps, leading to non-matching visual (e.g., no "lower" isolation of colors like in train 3 expected).

[2025-10-03 09:03:15] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three training examples, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that appear in **every** training input/output pair, where the interaction (e.g., adjacency leading to merging, position influencing color or size) is directly observable and consistent without forcing explanations or assuming unobservable semantics. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated small dots not adjacent to any structure, like some green/yellow singles with no nearby orange or colored block) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear interactions (e.g., variable hole creation rules, non-adjacent color changes) are noted as unknown rather than explained. No high-level puzzle solution or total transformation rule is inferred or provided.

#### 1. **Orange Single-Pixel Components (1 pixel, holes=0) and Adjacent Top Colored Blocks (Red/Blue/Yellow, varying pixels/holes)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Position-based adjacency (bbox overlap or touching edges, e.g., top-row orange at y=0 x=3/5/7/11 adjacent to top colored blocks at y=0-2).
   - **Effect**: In output, these orange pixels are consistently incorporated into the pixel count of the adjacent top colored block's transformed version, increasing total pixels (e.g., +1 pixel added consistently across examples). Bbox expands slightly to include the orange position.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in all three trains (e.g., train1: [3,0] and [7,0] add to middle/right top blocks; train2 similar; train3: [5,0]/[11,0] add to middle/right top Red/Yellow).
   - **Properties Involved**: Position (y=0 adjacency) → pixel count increase; no color change to orange itself (oranges disappear in output).
   - **Unknown**: Whether this always adds exactly +1 or varies by exact edge touch (cannot explain without grid cell-level data).

#### 2. **Orange 5-Pixel Polyominoes (holes=0, bbox spanning 3x3 area) and Adjacent Colored Blocks (Top or Bottom, e.g., Red/Blue/Yellow/Pink/Dark Red/Green/Maroon/Light Blue)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Position-based connectivity (bbox overlap or adjacent, e.g., orange [2,2-4,4] or [6,2-8,4] touching top colored at y=0-2 or lower at y=6-8).
   - **Effect**: These orange polyominoes consistently merge with adjacent colored blocks in output, adding their 5 pixels to the output component's total pixels and expanding the bbox to union the areas (e.g., vertical/horizontal extension). The output component takes the color of the adjacent colored block (no new color introduced).
   - **Consistency**: Present in all three trains (e.g., train1: [2,2-4,4] and [6,2-8,4] merge into middle output Blue [3,0-8,5] adding 10 pixels total from two polyominoes; train2: similar merge into [6,0-8,5]; train3: multiple such as [4,4-6,6]/[10,4-12,6] merge into horizontal Maroon outputs, adding ~5-10 pixels each).
   - **Properties Involved**: Position adjacency → pixel sum (colored pixels + 5); bbox union; preserves input colored block's hole if present (e.g., train1 Blue hole=1 → output hole=1).
   - **Unknown**: Directionality of merge (e.g., does it always expand downward from top blocks, or bidirectional?); why some merges create horizontal lines in train3 but vertical in trains 1-2.

#### 3. **Bottom Single-Pixel Colored Components (1 pixel, holes=0, e.g., Pink/Dark Red/Blue/Light Blue/Green/Maroon) and Adjacent Lower Orange Polyominoes (5 pixels, holes=0)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Position-based adjacency (bottom singles at y=9/13 adjacent to lower orange polyominoes at y=6-8/10-12, e.g., x=1/5/9 near [2,6-4,8]).
   - **Effect**: The bottom single's color consistently propagates to the adjacent lower orange polyomino in output, transforming the polyomino's pixels to the bottom single's color, adding the 1 pixel, and expanding bbox to cover the polyomino area (resulting in ~6-9 pixel output components). No holes added here.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in all three trains (e.g., train1: Pink [1,9] + [2,6-4,8] → Pink [0,6-2,8] 9 pixels; train2: Light Blue [5,9] + left lower orange → Light Blue [0,6-5,8] 16 pixels, but core +5 from polyomino; train3: Green [2,13] + lower oranges → part of Green [0,15-9,24] with added pixels).
   - **Properties Involved**: Color of bottom single → color of output merged component; position (y=9/13 adjacency) → pixel sum (1 + 5); bbox expansion downward.
   - **Unknown**: Why pixel sum exceeds 6 in some cases (e.g., train2 16, train3 57—possibly additional merges, but not consistently explained); no consistent hole addition (0 in most, but 2/7/13 in some outputs).

#### 4. **Top Colored Blocks with Holes (e.g., Blue/Red/Yellow, holes≥1) and Surrounding Orange Components (singles + polyominoes)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Enclosure or multi-adjacency (top holed blocks surrounded by multiple orange components, e.g., bbox overlap on multiple sides).
   - **Effect**: The holed block consistently merges with all surrounding oranges in output, preserving the hole count, adding all adjacent orange pixels, and expanding bbox to cover the enclosed area. Color may stay the same if no conflicting bottom signal.
   - **Consistency**: Every train has at least one holed top block that interacts this way (e.g., train1: Blue hole=1 [4,0-6,2] + surrounding oranges → Blue hole=1 [3,0-8,5]; train2: Red hole=1 [4,0-6,2] contributes to larger merges but hole not directly preserved—wait, inconsistent preservation, but merge+expansion is consistent; train3: Blue hole=2 [0,0-4,4] + Yellow hole=1 → contributes to Pink hole=13 [0,0-14,24], hole increased but original holes influence total).
   - **Properties Involved**: Hole count (input ≥1) → output hole ≥1; position enclosure → pixel sum of all adjacent oranges; bbox union of enclosed area.
   - **Unknown**: Exact hole count transformation (preserved in train1, increased to 2/7/13 in trains 2-3—possibly summed or multiplied by merges, but not consistently predictable); color preservation only if matching bottom (e.g., Blue stays in train1, but Red/Yellow change in all).

#### General Consistent Properties Across All Interactions
- **Pixel Count**: Always increases via sum of interacting components' pixels (colored + orange); no pixel loss except possibly in unknown hole creation.
- **Bbox Transformation**: Consistently expands to minimal bounding box of all interacting components' positions (union operation).
- **Color Propagation**: Bottom single-pixel colors consistently override or fill adjacent orange paths; top block colors persist unless overridden (but override rule unknown).
- **Holes Overall**: Input holes (only in top colored blocks) consistently carry over or contribute to output holes; no input orange has holes, and outputs never introduce holes without input hole influence.
- **Disappearance of Oranges**: All orange components consistently vanish in output, absorbed into colored components they adjoin—no standalone orange outputs.
- **Unknown Across All**: Specific transformation for non-holed top blocks (e.g., Red/Yellow consistently change to Dark Red/Maroon/Green, but trigger—bottom signal mismatch?—not obvious or consistent without position details); no interaction with non-adjacent elements (e.g., distant dots ignored); grid scaling (train3 larger, but interactions scale proportionally).

No other connections (e.g., line segments, L-shapes, or maroon/red lines) show consistent interaction across all examples—they appear sporadically and do not reliably affect outputs (e.g., present in train3/test but not merged in trains 1-2). If more grid-level adjacency data were provided, additional position->position links could be checked, but current bboxes show only the above as obvious.

[2025-10-03 09:05:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three training examples, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that appear in **every** training input/output pair, where the interaction (e.g., adjacency leading to merging, position influencing color or size) is directly observable and consistent without forcing explanations or assuming unobservable semantics. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated small dots not adjacent to any structure, like some green/yellow singles with no nearby orange or colored block) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear interactions (e.g., variable hole creation rules, non-adjacent color changes) are noted as unknown rather than explained. No high-level puzzle solution or total transformation rule is inferred or provided.

#### 1. **Orange Single-Pixel Components (1 pixel, holes=0) and Adjacent Top Colored Blocks (Red/Blue/Yellow, varying pixels/holes)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Position-based adjacency (bbox overlap or touching edges, e.g., top-row orange at y=0 x=3/5/7/11 adjacent to top colored blocks at y=0-2).
   - **Effect**: In output, these orange pixels are consistently incorporated into the pixel count of the adjacent top colored block's transformed version, increasing total pixels (e.g., +1 pixel added consistently across examples). Bbox expands slightly to include the orange position.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in all three trains (e.g., train1: [3,0] and [7,0] add to middle/right top blocks; train2 similar; train3: [5,0]/[11,0] add to middle/right top Red/Yellow).
   - **Properties Involved**: Position (y=0 adjacency) → pixel count increase; no color change to orange itself (oranges disappear in output).
   - **Unknown**: Whether this always adds exactly +1 or varies by exact edge touch (cannot explain without grid cell-level data).

#### 2. **Orange 5-Pixel Polyominoes (holes=0, bbox spanning 3x3 area) and Adjacent Colored Blocks (Top or Bottom, e.g., Red/Blue/Yellow/Pink/Dark Red/Green/Maroon/Light Blue)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Position-based connectivity (bbox overlap or adjacent, e.g., orange [2,2-4,4] or [6,2-8,4] touching top colored at y=0-2 or lower at y=6-8).
   - **Effect**: These orange polyominoes consistently merge with adjacent colored blocks in output, adding their 5 pixels to the output component's total pixels and expanding the bbox to union the areas (e.g., vertical/horizontal extension). The output component takes the color of the adjacent colored block (no new color introduced).
   - **Consistency**: Present in all three trains (e.g., train1: [2,2-4,4] and [6,2-8,4] merge into middle output Blue [3,0-8,5] adding 10 pixels total from two polyominoes; train2: similar merge into [6,0-8,5]; train3: multiple such as [4,4-6,6]/[10,4-12,6] merge into horizontal Maroon outputs, adding ~5-10 pixels each).
   - **Properties Involved**: Position adjacency → pixel sum (colored pixels + 5); bbox union; preserves input colored block's hole if present (e.g., train1 Blue hole=1 → output hole=1).
   - **Unknown**: Directionality of merge (e.g., does it always expand downward from top blocks, or bidirectional?); why some merges create horizontal lines in train3 but vertical in trains 1-2.

#### 3. **Bottom Single-Pixel Colored Components (1 pixel, holes=0, e.g., Pink/Dark Red/Blue/Light Blue/Green/Maroon) and Adjacent Lower Orange Polyominoes (5 pixels, holes=0)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Position-based adjacency (bottom singles at y=9/13 adjacent to lower orange polyominoes at y=6-8/10-12, e.g., x=1/5/9 near [2,6-4,8]).
   - **Effect**: The bottom single's color consistently propagates to the adjacent lower orange polyomino in output, transforming the polyomino's pixels to the bottom single's color, adding the 1 pixel, and expanding bbox to cover the polyomino area (resulting in ~6-9 pixel output components). No holes added here.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in all three trains (e.g., train1: Pink [1,9] + [2,6-4,8] → Pink [0,6-2,8] 9 pixels; train2: Light Blue [5,9] + left lower orange → Light Blue [0,6-5,8] 16 pixels, but core +5 from polyomino; train3: Green [2,13] + lower oranges → part of Green [0,15-9,24] with added pixels).
   - **Properties Involved**: Color of bottom single → color of output merged component; position (y=9/13 adjacency) → pixel sum (1 + 5); bbox expansion downward.
   - **Unknown**: Why pixel sum exceeds 6 in some cases (e.g., train2 16, train3 57—possibly additional merges, but not consistently explained); no consistent hole addition (0 in most, but 2/7/13 in some outputs).

#### 4. **Top Colored Blocks with Holes (e.g., Blue/Red/Yellow, holes≥1) and Surrounding Orange Components (singles + polyominoes)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Enclosure or multi-adjacency (top holed blocks surrounded by multiple orange components, e.g., bbox overlap on multiple sides).
   - **Effect**: The holed block consistently merges with all surrounding oranges in output, preserving the hole count, adding all adjacent orange pixels, and expanding bbox to cover the enclosed area. Color may stay the same if no conflicting bottom signal.
   - **Consistency**: Every train has at least one holed top block that interacts this way (e.g., train1: Blue hole=1 [4,0-6,2] + surrounding oranges → Blue hole=1 [3,0-8,5]; train2: Red hole=1 [4,0-6,2] contributes to larger merges but hole not directly preserved—wait, inconsistent preservation, but merge+expansion is consistent; train3: Blue hole=2 [0,0-4,4] + Yellow hole=1 → contributes to Pink hole=13 [0,0-14,24], hole increased but original holes influence total).
   - **Properties Involved**: Hole count (input ≥1) → output hole ≥1; position enclosure → pixel sum of all adjacent oranges; bbox union of enclosed area.
   - **Unknown**: Exact hole count transformation (preserved in train1, increased to 2/7/13 in trains 2-3—possibly summed or multiplied by merges, but not consistently predictable); color preservation only if matching bottom (e.g., Blue stays in train1, but Red/Yellow change in all).

#### General Consistent Properties Across All Interactions
- **Pixel Count**: Always increases via sum of interacting components' pixels (colored + orange); no pixel loss except possibly in unknown hole creation.
- **Bbox Transformation**: Consistently expands to minimal bounding box of all interacting components' positions (union operation).
- **Color Propagation**: Bottom single-pixel colors consistently override or fill adjacent orange paths; top block colors persist unless overridden (but override rule unknown).
- **Holes Overall**: Input holes (only in top colored blocks) consistently carry over or contribute to output holes; no input orange has holes, and outputs never introduce holes without input hole influence.
- **Disappearance of Oranges**: All orange components consistently vanish in output, absorbed into colored components they adjoin—no standalone orange outputs.
- **Unknown Across All**: Specific transformation for non-holed top blocks (e.g., Red/Yellow consistently change to Dark Red/Maroon/Green, but trigger—bottom signal mismatch?—not obvious or consistent without position details); no interaction with non-adjacent elements (e.g., distant dots ignored); grid scaling (train3 larger, but interactions scale proportionally).

No other connections (e.g., line segments, L-shapes, or maroon/red lines) show consistent interaction across all examples—they appear sporadically and do not reliably affect outputs (e.g., present in train3/test but not merged in trains 1-2). If more grid-level adjacency data were provided, additional position->position links could be checked, but current bboxes show only the above as obvious.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 09:17:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where input grids use numbers to represent colored pixels (e.g., 0 for empty, 5 for orange, other numbers for colored blocks), and the goal is to apply specific rules to identify, merge, and transform components like single pixels, polyominoes, and blocks with holes, ultimately rendering a new output grid that reconstructs or transforms the input into patterned shapes. The rules focus on connectivity, adjacency to orange (5) elements, hole detection, and merging to create composite objects, with outputs being square grids (often 9x9 for training) that form recognizable patterns like letters or symbols.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules include: Rule 1 - Identify isolated single orange (5) pixels adjacent to top colored blocks (non-5, non-0) and merge them by adding 1 pixel and expanding bounding boxes; Rule 2 - Detect exactly 5 connected orange pixels (polyominoes) and merge with adjacent colored blocks, adding 5 pixels and unioning bounding boxes while preserving the colored block's color; Rule 3 - Find single colored pixels in the bottom row (isolated, no adjacent non-zeros in row) and propagate/merge them with adjacent orange (5) components above, counting total pixels and bounding boxes; Rule 4 - Identify colored blocks at the top with internal holes (empty 0s enclosed by non-0s), merge with surrounding orange components, union bounding boxes, add pixels, and accumulate holes.
 * Subtleties: Connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right) for adjacency/merging, but isolation checks may include 8-directional for singles/polyominoes; orange (5) acts as a "bridge" or filler that gets absorbed into colored components without changing their color; holes are only counted in top colored blocks and preserved/added during merges; bottom singles only propagate upward to oranges, not sideways or to other colors; top blocks are scanned in upper rows (e.g., first 3 rows) for non-5 clusters with enclosed 0s; polyominoes must be exactly 5 connected 5's, not more/less, and only horizontal runs were simplified but likely need full flood-fill for vertical/diagonal connections; output rendering places merged components side-by-side in sub-rectangles of a square grid sized based on max bbox dimensions times component count, filling with the component's color.
 * Key considerations: Avoid nested loops for efficiency but ensure full scans for detection (e.g., flood-fill for polyominoes/holes); handle variable grid sizes (e.g., training 3 is 20x25, but outputs square); merges assume adjacency (direct neighbor) and may combine multiple components into one dict with updated pixels/bbox/holes; if no components, default to empty or small grid; preserve original colors for merged blocks (e.g., bottom single's color overrides absorbed 5's); subtle: orange singles only merge if adjacent to top colored (not bottom), and top holes detection requires enclosed 0s (not just any 0s); output must exactly match expected patterns, which seem to form "E", "H", or complex symbols by placing transformed blocks.
 * Across attempts: No actual detection happens due to placeholders/simplifications (e.g., empty returns for top blocks, linear scans missing vertical connections); bounding box expansions must be precise (e.g., min/max row/col including merged pixels); rendering fills entire sub-rects uniformly, but expected outputs have patterned fills (not solid), suggesting incomplete rendering logic; test inputs likely have similar structures (bottom singles, top holes, orange bridges) but program fails to extract any, leading to empty outputs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to structure rules sequentially (bottom singles -> top blocks -> orange singles -> polyominoes -> merges), which is helpful for composition but fails due to incomplete implementations (e.g., placeholders return empty lists, leading to no components detected).
 * What worked: Bottom singles detection is basic but correct for horizontal isolation; orange singles scan top rows and checks 8-dir isolation, partially useful; polyomino detection counts horizontal runs of exactly 5 fives, which catches simple cases but misses vertical/ irregular shapes.
 * What didn't work: Top colored with holes is a placeholder returning empty, missing hole detection (needs flood-fill or enclosure check); propagation/merging functions assume direct 4-dir adjacency but don't actually modify grid or handle multiple oranges; polyominoes only linear horizontal, ignoring connected components; rendering computes side length based on bboxes but fills sub-rects uniformly with color, producing solid blocks instead of patterned outputs like the expected letter-like shapes; merge functions overwrite lists simplistically (e.g., always to first block), losing multiple components; overall, no components are ever detected/merged, resulting in empty 9x9 zero grids for all training examples.
 * Training example 1: Generated all zeros instead of expected 9x9 with 7/1/6 patterns forming possible "E" or stacked shapes; missed detecting bottom 6's as singles, top 7/1 blocks with potential holes, and orange bridges (if any 5's present, though not shown).
 * Training example 2: All zeros vs. expected 9x9 with 3/7/9 patterns (possible "H" or symmetric); failed to detect top 3's with holes?, bottom 9's, and right-side 7's merging via 5's (if present).
 * Training example 3: All zeros vs. expected 20x25 complex pattern with 6/8/3/9 blocks, holes in 6's/3's, and extensive 8's/oranges; linear scans missed large vertical/diagonal connections and multiple merges.
 * Function `identify_top_colored_with_holes` is broken (placeholder, returns empty; not helpful without enclosure logic—avoid or replace with flood-fill).
 * Function `render_components_to_grid` is unhelpful (uniform fills don't match patterned expects; needs to render actual bbox shapes, not solid sub-rects).
 * Function `merge_top_with_oranges` and similar merges are simplistic (assume single block, no real adjacency check; partially useful for bbox union but broken for multi-component).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is all zeros in a 9x9 grid, which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates no components were detected or rendered despite the program claiming to process rules—expected outputs from training suggest patterned, non-zero grids with merged colors forming shapes.
 * It differs from training expects by lacking any color fills or patterns (e.g., no 7/1/6 like Train 1, no 3/7/9 like Train 2); likely the test input has similar elements (bottom singles, top holes, orange polyominoes) that the simplifications miss, resulting in empty components list and default zero grid.
 * The uniform zero output across all cases shows the program doesn't handle variable input sizes or detect any valid components, so it can't produce the required transformed patterns—must update detection (e.g., full connected components) and rendering (e.g., copy input patterns into placed bboxes) to match.

[2025-10-03 09:17:29] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following list identifies only obvious, direct interactions or connections between elements/properties that are consistent across **all train examples** (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). These are limited to patterns where one element's property reliably affects or combines with another's in every case, without inferring a full mechanism or solution. Connections are based on shared properties like color, position (via bbox), holes, or pixels. No assumptions are made about semantic meaning, and only elements with clear, repeated interactions are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated top-row shapes without downstream effects) are excluded. Transformations (e.g., exact pixel summation or hole addition rules) that cannot be directly tied to consistent input-output links are noted as unknown.

- **Bottom-row single-pixel colored elements (color, position) → Output component colors**:  
  The colors of the three single-pixel elements at the maximum y-coordinate (e.g., y=9 in train 1/2, y=13 in train 3; positions roughly x=1-2 left, x=5-8 mid, x=9-14 right) directly determine the exclusive set of colors used in all output components. Every output component adopts one of these bottom colors (no new colors introduced). For example:  
  - Train 1 bottom (Pink left, Dark Red mid, Blue right) → Outputs use only Pink, Dark Red, Blue.  
  - Train 2 bottom (Dark Red left, Light Blue mid, Green right) → Outputs use only Dark Red, Light Blue, Green.  
  - Train 3 bottom (Green left, Maroon mid, Pink right) → Outputs use only Green, Maroon, Pink.  
  Position of each bottom element (left/mid/right) loosely correlates with output component positions (e.g., left bottom color appears in left-leaning output bboxes like [0,0-2,2] or [0,3-2,5]), but exact mapping per section is unknown.

- **Orange polyomino blocks and single pixels (position, pixels) → Output component bounding boxes (bbox expansion/merging)**:  
  The positions of orange blocks (e.g., 5-pixel polyominoes at bboxes like [2,2-4,4] or [2,6-4,8]) and single-pixel oranges (e.g., at edges like x=0/10, y=3/7) define vertical/horizontal boundaries that are consistently incorporated into output bboxes, causing merging and expansion of areas. Outputs always encompass multiple input orange positions, forming larger stacked or adjacent regions (e.g., train 1 oranges at y=2-4 and y=6-8 merge into output bboxes spanning y=0-8; consistent vertical stacking in all trains). Pixel counts from oranges contribute to output sizes (e.g., partial filling), but exact pixel transfer rules are unknown.

- **Top-row colored polyominoes (holes, position, pixels) → Output component holes and pixel counts in corresponding vertical sections**:  
  Hole counts and pixel counts from top-row colored shapes (y≈0-2, e.g., Red/Blue/Yellow with bboxes [0,0-2,2], [4,0-6,2], [8,0-10,2]) consistently influence the holes and approximate pixel volumes in output components at similar x-positions (left/mid/right sections). For example:  
  - Train 1 top-left Red (holes=0, pixels=9, bbox left) → Output left-top [0,0-2,2] (pixels≈8-9, holes present in section).  
  - Train 2 top-left Blue (holes=0, pixels=5, bbox left) → Output left-top [0,0-2,2] (pixels=6, holes=0).  
  - Train 3 top-left Blue (holes=2, pixels=19, bbox left) → Output left regions (e.g., Green [0,15-9,24] holes=7, incorporating high pixel volume).  
  However, top colors are overridden (see first connection), and hole/pixel adjustments (e.g., minor decreases like 9→8 or increases via merging) are consistent in effect but unknown in mechanism. Positions align vertically (top input bbox y-min≈0 maps to output y-min≈0 in same x-section).

- **Intermediate small colored elements (position, pixels; e.g., 1-3 pixel Yellow/Blue/Red at y≈4-6) → Output component pixel contributions in mid-level sections**:  
  Small colored pixels or short lines (e.g., Yellow [5,4-6,5] pixels=3 in train 1; Red [0,6-1,6] pixels=2 in train 2) at mid-heights (y≈4-6) consistently add their pixel counts to output components spanning those y-ranges (mid sections, x≈3-8). For example:  
  - Train 1 mid Yellow/Blue (pixels=3+1+1=5) → Contributes to Blue output [3,0-8,5] (pixels=21, includes mid-y expansion).  
  - Train 2 mid Yellow/Blue/Red (pixels=2+2+2=6) → Contributes to outputs like [6,0-8,5] (pixels=10).  
  - Train 3 mid Blue/Yellow/Red (pixels=3+7+6+11=27) → Contributes to mid Maroon [5,2-24,6] (pixels=58).  
  Their colors are overridden by bottom colors, and positions define partial vertical fills, but no hole interaction observed.

No other connections (e.g., direct color-to-color transfers from top to output, or consistent hole propagation rules) are obvious and present in every train example. Elements like lines/paths or plus signs are not detectable in the provided data, so no interactions identified for them.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 09:19:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following list identifies only obvious, direct interactions or connections between elements/properties that are consistent across **all train examples** (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). These are limited to patterns where one element's property reliably affects or combines with another's in every case, without inferring a full mechanism or solution. Connections are based on shared properties like color, position (via bbox), holes, or pixels. No assumptions are made about semantic meaning, and only elements with clear, repeated interactions are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated top-row shapes without downstream effects) are excluded. Transformations (e.g., exact pixel summation or hole addition rules) that cannot be directly tied to consistent input-output links are noted as unknown.

- **Bottom-row single-pixel colored elements (color, position) → Output component colors**:  
  The colors of the three single-pixel elements at the maximum y-coordinate (e.g., y=9 in train 1/2, y=13 in train 3; positions roughly x=1-2 left, x=5-8 mid, x=9-14 right) directly determine the exclusive set of colors used in all output components. Every output component adopts one of these bottom colors (no new colors introduced). For example:  
  - Train 1 bottom (Pink left, Dark Red mid, Blue right) → Outputs use only Pink, Dark Red, Blue.  
  - Train 2 bottom (Dark Red left, Light Blue mid, Green right) → Outputs use only Dark Red, Light Blue, Green.  
  - Train 3 bottom (Green left, Maroon mid, Pink right) → Outputs use only Green, Maroon, Pink.  
  Position of each bottom element (left/mid/right) loosely correlates with output component positions (e.g., left bottom color appears in left-leaning output bboxes like [0,0-2,2] or [0,3-2,5]), but exact mapping per section is unknown.

- **Orange polyomino blocks and single pixels (position, pixels) → Output component bounding boxes (bbox expansion/merging)**:  
  The positions of orange blocks (e.g., 5-pixel polyominoes at bboxes like [2,2-4,4] or [2,6-4,8]) and single-pixel oranges (e.g., at edges like x=0/10, y=3/7) define vertical/horizontal boundaries that are consistently incorporated into output bboxes, causing merging and expansion of areas. Outputs always encompass multiple input orange positions, forming larger stacked or adjacent regions (e.g., train 1 oranges at y=2-4 and y=6-8 merge into output bboxes spanning y=0-8; consistent vertical stacking in all trains). Pixel counts from oranges contribute to output sizes (e.g., partial filling), but exact pixel transfer rules are unknown.

- **Top-row colored polyominoes (holes, position, pixels) → Output component holes and pixel counts in corresponding vertical sections**:  
  Hole counts and pixel counts from top-row colored shapes (y≈0-2, e.g., Red/Blue/Yellow with bboxes [0,0-2,2], [4,0-6,2], [8,0-10,2]) consistently influence the holes and approximate pixel volumes in output components at similar x-positions (left/mid/right sections). For example:  
  - Train 1 top-left Red (holes=0, pixels=9, bbox left) → Output left-top [0,0-2,2] (pixels≈8-9, holes present in section).  
  - Train 2 top-left Blue (holes=0, pixels=5, bbox left) → Output left-top [0,0-2,2] (pixels=6, holes=0).  
  - Train 3 top-left Blue (holes=2, pixels=19, bbox left) → Output left regions (e.g., Green [0,15-9,24] holes=7, incorporating high pixel volume).  
  However, top colors are overridden (see first connection), and hole/pixel adjustments (e.g., minor decreases like 9→8 or increases via merging) are consistent in effect but unknown in mechanism. Positions align vertically (top input bbox y-min≈0 maps to output y-min≈0 in same x-section).

- **Intermediate small colored elements (position, pixels; e.g., 1-3 pixel Yellow/Blue/Red at y≈4-6) → Output component pixel contributions in mid-level sections**:  
  Small colored pixels or short lines (e.g., Yellow [5,4-6,5] pixels=3 in train 1; Red [0,6-1,6] pixels=2 in train 2) at mid-heights (y≈4-6) consistently add their pixel counts to output components spanning those y-ranges (mid sections, x≈3-8). For example:  
  - Train 1 mid Yellow/Blue (pixels=3+1+1=5) → Contributes to Blue output [3,0-8,5] (pixels=21, includes mid-y expansion).  
  - Train 2 mid Yellow/Blue/Red (pixels=2+2+2=6) → Contributes to outputs like [6,0-8,5] (pixels=10).  
  - Train 3 mid Blue/Yellow/Red (pixels=3+7+6+11=27) → Contributes to mid Maroon [5,2-24,6] (pixels=58).  
  Their colors are overridden by bottom colors, and positions define partial vertical fills, but no hole interaction observed.

No other connections (e.g., direct color-to-color transfers from top to output, or consistent hole propagation rules) are obvious and present in every train example. Elements like lines/paths or plus signs are not detectable in the provided data, so no interactions identified for them.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
