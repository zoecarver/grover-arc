=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 11:37:00] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 11:47:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving decoding a compact grid into a larger output grid, where the top row defines equal-length sections separated by 5s, each section representing an s x s block with an ID and mask pattern, colors are sourced from the bottom row's centers, and middle rows (starting from row s+1) provide specifications for placing these block types into a larger s² x s² output by overlaying masks with corresponding colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Top row sections are contiguous non-5 values separated by 5s; they must all have the same length s for the puzzle to be valid, but the test input violates this, suggesting the code needs to handle or detect unequal lengths without crashing (e.g., perhaps select a common s or process variably sized sections).
 * Each section's s x s block (columns from section start) must have a consistent non-zero ID value across all non-zero cells to define the block type; masks are binary (1 where original value matches ID, 0 elsewhere), capturing the pattern/shape of that ID.
 * Colors for each block type come from the bottom row at the center column of each section (start + s//2); zero there is invalid.
 * Placement grid (s x s) is initialized to -1; middle spec rows (from row s+1 onward) overlay IDs onto this grid at local positions, with later rows overwriting earlier ones if conflicts arise ("last wins").
 * Output is an n x n grid (n = s * s), tiled by placing each specified block type's mask (scaled up by s in both dimensions) and filling matching positions with the block's color; empty placements (-1) are skipped, leaving 0s.
 * Edge cases: empty grid returns empty; sections with no length or inconsistent/empty IDs raise errors; center columns must not exceed grid width; middle spec rows may not fully exist (skipped if out of bounds), and columns may exceed width.
 * Subtle: Masks are built only from the first s rows and section columns, assuming the grid height R >= s; IDs in middle spec must map to existing types, or error.
 * Potential miss: If sections are unequal in test, the puzzle might imply dynamic s (e.g., max or average length) or different section interpretation (e.g., 5s as dividers but allowing variable sizes with padding).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Function to find top-row sections (useful for parsing structure)
def find_sections(top_row: List[int]) -> List[tuple]:
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(top_row):
        if top_row[i] == 5:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        while i < len(top_row) and top_row[i] != 5:
            i += 1
        length = i - start
        if length > 0:
            sections.append((start, length))
    return sections
```

```python
# Function to build mask for a section (captures pattern; essential for overlaying shapes)
def build_mask(g: List[List[int]], start_col: int, s: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    mask = [[0] * s for _ in range(s)]
    id_val = 0
    consistent = True
    for rr in range(s):
        for cc in range(s):
            val = g[rr][start_col + cc]
            if val != 0:
                if id_val == 0:
                    id_val = val
                elif val != id_val:
                    consistent = False
                mask[rr][cc] = 1
    if not consistent or id_val == 0:
        raise ValueError("Inconsistent or empty section")
    return mask, id_val
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled all three training examples, accurately parsing sections, building consistent masks and IDs, extracting colors, overlaying placements from middle specs (with last-wins resolution), and tiling the large output with colored masks, producing exact matches.
 * Failed on test input by raising "Unequal section lengths" error early, as it strictly requires all sections to have identical length s but the test has varying lengths, halting execution without generating output.
 * Section finding works well (skips 5s, collects starts/lengths), but assumes uniformity; no handling for variable lengths leads to crash.
 * Mask building and ID consistency checks are solid and essential, correctly identifying patterns in s x s blocks.
 * Color extraction from bottom-row centers is precise and error-checked, working as expected in trains.
 * Middle spec placement logic (starting at row s+1, mapping IDs to types, local positioning, overwriting) is correct but skips invalid rows/columns gracefully; however, relies on uniform s.
 * Output tiling scales masks correctly into n x n (n=s*s) by blocking placements, filling only mask=1 positions with colors, leaving 0s elsewhere—matches trains perfectly.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all components (section finding, mask/ID building, placement overlay, tiling) are relevant and mostly correct, but the equal-length enforcement is overly rigid for the test.
 * Overall, core decoding (sections -> IDs/masks -> colors -> placements -> tiled output) is well-understood, but misses subtlety of handling non-uniform sections in test.

**Test output:**
 * No output generated for test due to execution error ("Unequal section lengths"), so it does not make sense or match expected puzzle rules; the program crashes instead of producing a grid, indicating it can't handle the test's variable section lengths.
 * Expected output should be a large grid (likely based on some derived s, e.g., maximum length or per-section processing) with tiled colored masks placed according to middle specs, but error prevents any generation—difference is complete absence vs. a valid decoded image.
 * Test likely requires adapting s per section or selecting a global s (e.g., gcd or min length) to avoid error, as uniform assumption holds for trains but not test; without this, output can't be verified but visually should resemble expanded patterns from trains.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 11:47:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 11:59:14] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with colored cells (numbers 1-9 representing colors), separators (likely rows dominated by 5s acting as dividers), and sections defined by non-zero cells in the bottom row, where the goal is to transform input bands into output patterns that replicate or abstract specific motifs (e.g., full blocks, frames, or sparse designs) based on color dominance and positional rules, rearranged into a new grid structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input grids have variable heights and widths, with the bottom row containing key colors (non-zero values) that dictate output motifs for corresponding sections; sections are centered around these bottom-row positions, with width derived from spacing between centers (d-1, radius r=(w-1)//2).
 * Separators are rows with >50% cells equal to 5, dividing the grid (excluding bottom row) into "bands"; each band is processed independently, but the last band has special rules (e.g., reset to zero then apply color-based patterns like empty for 7, frame for <=5, full for >5).
 * Output is structured as num_bands * w rows by num_sections * w columns, where "significant fill" (>50% non-zero cells in a band-section overlap) triggers filling a w x w block with the section's color; however, this density check fails to capture pattern subtlety (e.g., borders/frames vs. full/solid).
 * Patterns are not always full blocks: expected outputs show frame-like borders (top/bottom full rows, sides only on edges for inner rows), sparse/dotted placements (e.g., alternating 0s and colors), or asymmetric motifs that don't match simple density thresholds.
 * Padding to square if out_h != out_w is a creative but unhelpful assumption; expected outputs are rectangular and not padded.
 * Color 7 often appears empty or as a frame base, but rules vary; last band overrides prior fills, suggesting hierarchical processing.
 * Subtle element: Outputs preserve aspect ratios and positions relative to sections, but rotate/orient/reinterpret band contents (e.g., Train 1 bottom band uses 6 as solid left, 7 as frame right; Train 2 inverts top/bottom with sparse 3/7 and full 9).
 * Easy to miss: Not all filled sections trigger solids—patterns may derive from the band's own structure (e.g., extracting borders from input shapes) rather than just color-filling; zero sections in bottom row imply empty blocks.
 * Bands exclude the bottom row; if no separators, single band spans to h-1.
 * Variable section widths if uneven spacing, but code assumes uniform d.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Function to detect separator rows (useful for band division, but threshold > w_grid/2.0 may need tuning for edge cases)
def get_separator_rows(g: List[List[int]], w_grid: int) -> List[int]:
    return [i for i in range(len(g) - 1) if sum(1 for x in g[i] if x == 5) > w_grid / 2.0]
```

```python
# Function to extract centers and colors from bottom row (core for section identification)
def get_centers_and_colors(last_row: List[int]) -> tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    centers = [j for j in range(len(last_row)) if last_row[j] != 0]
    colors = [last_row[j] for j in range(len(last_row)) if last_row[j] != 0]
    return centers, colors
```

```python
# Function to check significant fill in band-section overlap (helpful for deciding if to process, but flawed for pattern extraction—use as starting point for density)
def has_significant_fill(g: List[List[int]], b_start: int, b_end: int, s_start: int, s_end: int, w: int) -> bool:
    num_cells = (b_end - b_start) * w  # Note: w here should be s_end - s_start
    num_filled = sum(1 for ii in range(b_start, b_end) for jj in range(s_start, s_end) if g[ii][jj] != 0)
    return num_filled > num_cells / 2
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt correctly identifies bottom-row centers/colors and derives section ranges with radius-based widths, which aligns with section isolation but fails to apply them accurately across bands.
 * Band detection via separator rows works conceptually (divides into top/middle/bottom-like sections in Train 1/2), but ignores non-separator bands and mishandles last band by resetting everything to 0 then applying incomplete rules.
 * Significant fill check triggers full blocks for dense areas (e.g., Train 1 top band generates full 6/7/1 rows, matching expected density but not frame pattern), but doesn't detect or replicate borders/sparse motifs (e.g., Train 1 expected has [7,0,7,...] frames, generated has solids).
 * Special last-band handling attempts frames for color <=5 (e.g., Train 1 bottom generates partial frame for 1 but wrong color/placement; uses 6/1 instead of 6/7), but overrides prior bands incorrectly and ignores color=7 as empty.
 * Train 1: Generated full top block (6/7/1) and partial bottom frame, but expected alternates frames in middle band (7/1) and solid/frame bottom (6/7); mismatches colors (uses 1 instead of 7 in bottom right) and adds empty middle rows incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated full top (7/9/3) and partial bottom frame, but expected sparse/dotted top/middle (3/7 with 0s in checker-like pattern) and full bottom (9 with frame?); completely wrong orientation—expected inverts vertical stacking, and sparse patterns not captured (density check fails for low-fill motifs).
 * Train 3: Generated repeated full blocks (3/8/6) for top/bottom with empty middle, but expected complex multi-row patterns with interwoven 6/8 frames/sparses across larger width (25 cols?), including lower sections with 3/6 motifs; section_ranges likely too narrow (w=4? but expected spans more), leading to underfilled output; all-zero middle band correct in emptiness but not in structure.
 * Padding to square produces 9x9 for Train 1/2 (unneeded, expected 9x9 but rectangular intent) and 15x15 for Train 3 (mismatches expected ~25x20? with patterns); this distorts and adds zeros incorrectly.
 * Function `has_significant_fill` is partially helpful for density but broken for sparse/ frame detection (always binarizes to full/empty, missing patterns like borders); tune threshold or replace with pattern extraction (e.g., detect edges).
 * Overall, attempt understands band/section division (core structure) but misses pattern replication rules (e.g., copy/transform input shapes per section/color); no object extraction, so motifs like frames aren't isolated—consider adding blob/connected-component analysis.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is all zeros across a 15x30 grid (padded square?), which does not look correct—likely due to no significant fill detected in any band-section or empty bottom row/centers, but expected should have patterned blocks if input has colors (test input not shown, but assuming non-trivial, this indicates failure to process bands or extract colors).
 * All-zero output ignores any potential separators or bottom colors, suggesting broken edge-case handling (e.g., s=0 or no bands triggers empty, but puzzle likely requires patterned output even for sparse inputs); differs from training expects by lacking any color fills/frames.
 * Test output makes no sense for a visual puzzle—it's a blank canvas, missing all motif abstraction; to handle test, ensure fallback for low-density (e.g., extract borders regardless of >50% fill) and verify input parsing (e.g., if test has uneven sections or no 5s, single-band processing fails).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving decoding a compact grid into a larger output grid, where the top row defines equal-length sections separated by 5s, each section representing an s x s block with an ID and mask pattern, colors are sourced from the bottom row's centers, and middle rows (starting from row s+1) provide specifications for placing these block types into a larger s² x s² output by overlaying masks with corresponding colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Top row sections are contiguous non-5 values separated by 5s; they must all have the same length s for the puzzle to be valid, but the test input violates this, suggesting the code needs to handle or detect unequal lengths without crashing (e.g., perhaps select a common s or process variably sized sections).
 * Each section's s x s block (columns from section start) must have a consistent non-zero ID value across all non-zero cells to define the block type; masks are binary (1 where original value matches ID, 0 elsewhere), capturing the pattern/shape of that ID.
 * Colors for each block type come from the bottom row at the center column of each section (start + s//2); zero there is invalid.
 * Placement grid (s x s) is initialized to -1; middle spec rows (from row s+1 onward) overlay IDs onto this grid at local positions, with later rows overwriting earlier ones if conflicts arise ("last wins").
 * Output is an n x n grid (n = s * s), tiled by placing each specified block type's mask (scaled up by s in both dimensions) and filling matching positions with the block's color; empty placements (-1) are skipped, leaving 0s.
 * Edge cases: empty grid returns empty; sections with no length or inconsistent/empty IDs raise errors; center columns must not exceed grid width; middle spec rows may not fully exist (skipped if out of bounds), and columns may exceed width.
 * Subtle: Masks are built only from the first s rows and section columns, assuming the grid height R >= s; IDs in middle spec must map to existing types, or error.
 * Potential miss: If sections are unequal in test, the puzzle might imply dynamic s (e.g., max or average length) or different section interpretation (e.g., 5s as dividers but allowing variable sizes with padding).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Function to find top-row sections (useful for parsing structure)
def find_sections(top_row: List[int]) -> List[tuple]:
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(top_row):
        if top_row[i] == 5:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        while i < len(top_row) and top_row[i] != 5:
            i += 1
        length = i - start
        if length > 0:
            sections.append((start, length))
    return sections
```

```python
# Function to build mask for a section (captures pattern; essential for overlaying shapes)
def build_mask(g: List[List[int]], start_col: int, s: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    mask = [[0] * s for _ in range(s)]
    id_val = 0
    consistent = True
    for rr in range(s):
        for cc in range(s):
            val = g[rr][start_col + cc]
            if val != 0:
                if id_val == 0:
                    id_val = val
                elif val != id_val:
                    consistent = False
                mask[rr][cc] = 1
    if not consistent or id_val == 0:
        raise ValueError("Inconsistent or empty section")
    return mask, id_val
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled all three training examples, accurately parsing sections, building consistent masks and IDs, extracting colors, overlaying placements from middle specs (with last-wins resolution), and tiling the large output with colored masks, producing exact matches.
 * Failed on test input by raising "Unequal section lengths" error early, as it strictly requires all sections to have identical length s but the test has varying lengths, halting execution without generating output.
 * Section finding works well (skips 5s, collects starts/lengths), but assumes uniformity; no handling for variable lengths leads to crash.
 * Mask building and ID consistency checks are solid and essential, correctly identifying patterns in s x s blocks.
 * Color extraction from bottom-row centers is precise and error-checked, working as expected in trains.
 * Middle spec placement logic (starting at row s+1, mapping IDs to types, local positioning, overwriting) is correct but skips invalid rows/columns gracefully; however, relies on uniform s.
 * Output tiling scales masks correctly into n x n (n=s*s) by blocking placements, filling only mask=1 positions with colors, leaving 0s elsewhere—matches trains perfectly.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all components (section finding, mask/ID building, placement overlay, tiling) are relevant and mostly correct, but the equal-length enforcement is overly rigid for the test.
 * Overall, core decoding (sections -> IDs/masks -> colors -> placements -> tiled output) is well-understood, but misses subtlety of handling non-uniform sections in test.

**Test output:**
 * No output generated for test due to execution error ("Unequal section lengths"), so it does not make sense or match expected puzzle rules; the program crashes instead of producing a grid, indicating it can't handle the test's variable section lengths.
 * Expected output should be a large grid (likely based on some derived s, e.g., maximum length or per-section processing) with tiled colored masks placed according to middle specs, but error prevents any generation—difference is complete absence vs. a valid decoded image.
 * Test likely requires adapting s per section or selecting a global s (e.g., gcd or min length) to avoid error, as uniform assumption holds for trains but not test; without this, output can't be verified but visually should resemble expanded patterns from trains.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 12:10:26] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid's top row defines sections of consecutive non-5 values to determine a size parameter s (from the first section's length), extract colored mask patterns (s x s) for each section from the top s rows (with consistency checks), and use selected middle rows (non-separator rows with few 5s) to determine placements of these masks into an s x s arrangement, which is then expanded into an s*s x s*s output grid filled with the corresponding colors where masks indicate presence.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Top row parsing identifies sections as runs of non-5 values separated by 5s; s is strictly the length of the very first such section, and all processing assumes at least one section exists (returns empty if none).
 * Masks are extracted from the top min(s, h) rows but padded to exactly s x s; for each section k, the mask covers only the first min(s, section_length) columns starting from the section's start position, with padding of zeros on the right if the section is shorter than s; the "center" for color extraction is start + min(s//2, section_length-1), using the bottom row's value at that column.
 * Mask consistency requires all non-zero values in the extracted subgrid to be identical (same ID), otherwise it's marked invalid (id_val=-1, but still proceeds with empty mask); IDs map to type indices k only if consistent and non-zero.
 * Non-separator rows are strictly from row s to h-2 (excluding top s and bottom row), defined as having <= w/2 fives (float division, so tolerant of some 5s); these are used sequentially (up to s of them) as "placement rows" to assign types to local column positions within each section's effective range (start to start + min(s, length)).
 * Placement builds an s x s grid where each cell (p, local_col) gets the type k if a matching ID appears in the p-th placement row at a global column j within the k-th section's effective range; unassigned cells remain -1 and are skipped in output.
 * Output expansion tiles each mask into the larger grid at positions dictated by the placement grid, filling only where mask[local_r][local_c] != 0 with the type's color; assumes square output of size s*s x s*s, all initialized to 0.
 * Edge cases: If first section length=0 or no sections, outputs empty; if fewer than s placement rows, only uses available ones (rest unassigned); sections shorter than s get truncated masks; invalid (inconsistent) types are skipped in placement/mapping but their masks are still built (though unused); w may not be multiple of s, and sections may not cover full width.
 * Subtle: Color extraction uses bottom row (h-1), which must be valid index; out-of-bounds columns default to 0 for values; placement ignores 0s and 5s in middle rows, and skips if ID not mapped to a type; effective end for placement is start + min(s, length), so short sections limit local assignments even if placement row has values beyond.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it successfully handled all three training examples (outputs matched expected results, demonstrating correct parsing of sections, mask extraction with consistency, color assignment from bottom centers, selection of up to s non-separator middle rows, placement assignment within effective section ranges, and output expansion).
 * What worked: Section parsing and s computation correctly identified patterns in training inputs; mask building captured consistent IDs and padded appropriately; placement used sequential non-separator rows to map IDs to local positions without overstepping short sections; output tiling filled only masked areas with colors, leaving unplaced/empty areas as 0, which aligned with training expectations.
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the program produced a completely empty (all-0s) 25x25 grid (implying s=5, but no placements or masks applied), suggesting a failure in one of the early steps—possibly no valid sections (all top row 5s or first section length 0), no consistent IDs in top rows, no mapped types, no non-separator middle rows available, or all placements remaining -1 due to IDs not matching or positions outside effective ranges; this differs from training where structure was present, indicating the test may be an edge case like inconsistent masks, short/missing sections, or middle rows with too many 5s or unmapped values.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, as all provided functions align with the puzzle logic and worked for training; however, the consistency check in build_type_data may be too strict for test (invalidates types if any non-zero variance, leading to no id_to_type mappings and thus empty placement).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 25x25 grid entirely filled with 0s across all rows, which does not look correct—it lacks any colored or patterned structure, implying the program detected s=5 (since 5*5=25) but failed to place any masks (all placement cells likely remained -1, or no valid types/colors were extracted).
 * This is different from expected, as a valid puzzle test input should produce a composed grid with colored regions from the masks tiled according to middle-row placements (e.g., non-zero values in specific blocks); the all-0s suggests a breakdown like invalid/empty sections, no consistent mask IDs (all types skipped), or no usable middle rows (all separators or <s available), but without the test input grid visible, it's unclear if this is a program bug (e.g., over-strict consistency or range checks) or a true empty-case puzzle.
 * The output makes sense only if the test input has no valid sections or all elements invalid, but given training successes, it's likely incorrect handling of a subtle test variation (e.g., sections with mixed IDs, bottom row out-of-bounds centers, or middle rows with values outside effective ends); this needs fixing to populate at least some placements if partial data exists.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 12:10:26] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with colored cells (numbers 1-9 representing colors), separators (likely rows dominated by 5s acting as dividers), and sections defined by non-zero cells in the bottom row, where the goal is to transform input bands into output patterns that replicate or abstract specific motifs (e.g., full blocks, frames, or sparse designs) based on color dominance and positional rules, rearranged into a new grid structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input grids have variable heights and widths, with the bottom row containing key colors (non-zero values) that dictate output motifs for corresponding sections; sections are centered around these bottom-row positions, with width derived from spacing between centers (d-1, radius r=(w-1)//2).
 * Separators are rows with >50% cells equal to 5, dividing the grid (excluding bottom row) into "bands"; each band is processed independently, but the last band has special rules (e.g., reset to zero then apply color-based patterns like empty for 7, frame for <=5, full for >5).
 * Output is structured as num_bands * w rows by num_sections * w columns, where "significant fill" (>50% non-zero cells in a band-section overlap) triggers filling a w x w block with the section's color; however, this density check fails to capture pattern subtlety (e.g., borders/frames vs. full/solid).
 * Patterns are not always full blocks: expected outputs show frame-like borders (top/bottom full rows, sides only on edges for inner rows), sparse/dotted placements (e.g., alternating 0s and colors), or asymmetric motifs that don't match simple density thresholds.
 * Padding to square if out_h != out_w is a creative but unhelpful assumption; expected outputs are rectangular and not padded.
 * Color 7 often appears empty or as a frame base, but rules vary; last band overrides prior fills, suggesting hierarchical processing.
 * Subtle element: Outputs preserve aspect ratios and positions relative to sections, but rotate/orient/reinterpret band contents (e.g., Train 1 bottom band uses 6 as solid left, 7 as frame right; Train 2 inverts top/bottom with sparse 3/7 and full 9).
 * Easy to miss: Not all filled sections trigger solids—patterns may derive from the band's own structure (e.g., extracting borders from input shapes) rather than just color-filling; zero sections in bottom row imply empty blocks.
 * Bands exclude the bottom row; if no separators, single band spans to h-1.
 * Variable section widths if uneven spacing, but code assumes uniform d.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Function to detect separator rows (useful for band division, but threshold > w_grid/2.0 may need tuning for edge cases)
def get_separator_rows(g: List[List[int]], w_grid: int) -> List[int]:
    return [i for i in range(len(g) - 1) if sum(1 for x in g[i] if x == 5) > w_grid / 2.0]
```

```python
# Function to extract centers and colors from bottom row (core for section identification)
def get_centers_and_colors(last_row: List[int]) -> tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    centers = [j for j in range(len(last_row)) if last_row[j] != 0]
    colors = [last_row[j] for j in range(len(last_row)) if last_row[j] != 0]
    return centers, colors
```

```python
# Function to check significant fill in band-section overlap (helpful for deciding if to process, but flawed for pattern extraction—use as starting point for density)
def has_significant_fill(g: List[List[int]], b_start: int, b_end: int, s_start: int, s_end: int, w: int) -> bool:
    num_cells = (b_end - b_start) * w  # Note: w here should be s_end - s_start
    num_filled = sum(1 for ii in range(b_start, b_end) for jj in range(s_start, s_end) if g[ii][jj] != 0)
    return num_filled > num_cells / 2
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt correctly identifies bottom-row centers/colors and derives section ranges with radius-based widths, which aligns with section isolation but fails to apply them accurately across bands.
 * Band detection via separator rows works conceptually (divides into top/middle/bottom-like sections in Train 1/2), but ignores non-separator bands and mishandles last band by resetting everything to 0 then applying incomplete rules.
 * Significant fill check triggers full blocks for dense areas (e.g., Train 1 top band generates full 6/7/1 rows, matching expected density but not frame pattern), but doesn't detect or replicate borders/sparse motifs (e.g., Train 1 expected has [7,0,7,...] frames, generated has solids).
 * Special last-band handling attempts frames for color <=5 (e.g., Train 1 bottom generates partial frame for 1 but wrong color/placement; uses 6/1 instead of 6/7), but overrides prior bands incorrectly and ignores color=7 as empty.
 * Train 1: Generated full top block (6/7/1) and partial bottom frame, but expected alternates frames in middle band (7/1) and solid/frame bottom (6/7); mismatches colors (uses 1 instead of 7 in bottom right) and adds empty middle rows incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated full top (7/9/3) and partial bottom frame, but expected sparse/dotted top/middle (3/7 with 0s in checker-like pattern) and full bottom (9 with frame?); completely wrong orientation—expected inverts vertical stacking, and sparse patterns not captured (density check fails for low-fill motifs).
 * Train 3: Generated repeated full blocks (3/8/6) for top/bottom with empty middle, but expected complex multi-row patterns with interwoven 6/8 frames/sparses across larger width (25 cols?), including lower sections with 3/6 motifs; section_ranges likely too narrow (w=4? but expected spans more), leading to underfilled output; all-zero middle band correct in emptiness but not in structure.
 * Padding to square produces 9x9 for Train 1/2 (unneeded, expected 9x9 but rectangular intent) and 15x15 for Train 3 (mismatches expected ~25x20? with patterns); this distorts and adds zeros incorrectly.
 * Function `has_significant_fill` is partially helpful for density but broken for sparse/ frame detection (always binarizes to full/empty, missing patterns like borders); tune threshold or replace with pattern extraction (e.g., detect edges).
 * Overall, attempt understands band/section division (core structure) but misses pattern replication rules (e.g., copy/transform input shapes per section/color); no object extraction, so motifs like frames aren't isolated—consider adding blob/connected-component analysis.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is all zeros across a 15x30 grid (padded square?), which does not look correct—likely due to no significant fill detected in any band-section or empty bottom row/centers, but expected should have patterned blocks if input has colors (test input not shown, but assuming non-trivial, this indicates failure to process bands or extract colors).
 * All-zero output ignores any potential separators or bottom colors, suggesting broken edge-case handling (e.g., s=0 or no bands triggers empty, but puzzle likely requires patterned output even for sparse inputs); differs from training expects by lacking any color fills/frames.
 * Test output makes no sense for a visual puzzle—it's a blank canvas, missing all motif abstraction; to handle test, ensure fallback for low-density (e.g., extract borders regardless of >50% fill) and verify input parsing (e.g., if test has uneven sections or no 5s, single-band processing fails).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving decoding a compact grid into a larger output grid, where the top row defines equal-length sections separated by 5s, each section representing an s x s block with an ID and mask pattern, colors are sourced from the bottom row's centers, and middle rows (starting from row s+1) provide specifications for placing these block types into a larger s² x s² output by overlaying masks with corresponding colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Top row sections are contiguous non-5 values separated by 5s; they must all have the same length s for the puzzle to be valid, but the test input violates this, suggesting the code needs to handle or detect unequal lengths without crashing (e.g., perhaps select a common s or process variably sized sections).
 * Each section's s x s block (columns from section start) must have a consistent non-zero ID value across all non-zero cells to define the block type; masks are binary (1 where original value matches ID, 0 elsewhere), capturing the pattern/shape of that ID.
 * Colors for each block type come from the bottom row at the center column of each section (start + s//2); zero there is invalid.
 * Placement grid (s x s) is initialized to -1; middle spec rows (from row s+1 onward) overlay IDs onto this grid at local positions, with later rows overwriting earlier ones if conflicts arise ("last wins").
 * Output is an n x n grid (n = s * s), tiled by placing each specified block type's mask (scaled up by s in both dimensions) and filling matching positions with the block's color; empty placements (-1) are skipped, leaving 0s.
 * Edge cases: empty grid returns empty; sections with no length or inconsistent/empty IDs raise errors; center columns must not exceed grid width; middle spec rows may not fully exist (skipped if out of bounds), and columns may exceed width.
 * Subtle: Masks are built only from the first s rows and section columns, assuming the grid height R >= s; IDs in middle spec must map to existing types, or error.
 * Potential miss: If sections are unequal in test, the puzzle might imply dynamic s (e.g., max or average length) or different section interpretation (e.g., 5s as dividers but allowing variable sizes with padding).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Function to find top-row sections (useful for parsing structure)
def find_sections(top_row: List[int]) -> List[tuple]:
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(top_row):
        if top_row[i] == 5:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        while i < len(top_row) and top_row[i] != 5:
            i += 1
        length = i - start
        if length > 0:
            sections.append((start, length))
    return sections
```

```python
# Function to build mask for a section (captures pattern; essential for overlaying shapes)
def build_mask(g: List[List[int]], start_col: int, s: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    mask = [[0] * s for _ in range(s)]
    id_val = 0
    consistent = True
    for rr in range(s):
        for cc in range(s):
            val = g[rr][start_col + cc]
            if val != 0:
                if id_val == 0:
                    id_val = val
                elif val != id_val:
                    consistent = False
                mask[rr][cc] = 1
    if not consistent or id_val == 0:
        raise ValueError("Inconsistent or empty section")
    return mask, id_val
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled all three training examples, accurately parsing sections, building consistent masks and IDs, extracting colors, overlaying placements from middle specs (with last-wins resolution), and tiling the large output with colored masks, producing exact matches.
 * Failed on test input by raising "Unequal section lengths" error early, as it strictly requires all sections to have identical length s but the test has varying lengths, halting execution without generating output.
 * Section finding works well (skips 5s, collects starts/lengths), but assumes uniformity; no handling for variable lengths leads to crash.
 * Mask building and ID consistency checks are solid and essential, correctly identifying patterns in s x s blocks.
 * Color extraction from bottom-row centers is precise and error-checked, working as expected in trains.
 * Middle spec placement logic (starting at row s+1, mapping IDs to types, local positioning, overwriting) is correct but skips invalid rows/columns gracefully; however, relies on uniform s.
 * Output tiling scales masks correctly into n x n (n=s*s) by blocking placements, filling only mask=1 positions with colors, leaving 0s elsewhere—matches trains perfectly.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all components (section finding, mask/ID building, placement overlay, tiling) are relevant and mostly correct, but the equal-length enforcement is overly rigid for the test.
 * Overall, core decoding (sections -> IDs/masks -> colors -> placements -> tiled output) is well-understood, but misses subtlety of handling non-uniform sections in test.

**Test output:**
 * No output generated for test due to execution error ("Unequal section lengths"), so it does not make sense or match expected puzzle rules; the program crashes instead of producing a grid, indicating it can't handle the test's variable section lengths.
 * Expected output should be a large grid (likely based on some derived s, e.g., maximum length or per-section processing) with tiled colored masks placed according to middle specs, but error prevents any generation—difference is complete absence vs. a valid decoded image.
 * Test likely requires adapting s per section or selecting a global s (e.g., gcd or min length) to avoid error, as uniform assumption holds for trains but not test; without this, output can't be verified but visually should resemble expanded patterns from trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid's top row defines sections of consecutive non-5 values to determine a size parameter s (from the first section's length), extract colored mask patterns (s x s) for each section from the top s rows (with consistency checks), and use selected middle rows (non-separator rows with few 5s) to determine placements of these masks into an s x s arrangement, which is then expanded into an s*s x s*s output grid filled with the corresponding colors where masks indicate presence.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Top row parsing identifies sections as runs of non-5 values separated by 5s; s is strictly the length of the very first such section, and all processing assumes at least one section exists (returns empty if none).
 * Masks are extracted from the top min(s, h) rows but padded to exactly s x s; for each section k, the mask covers only the first min(s, section_length) columns starting from the section's start position, with padding of zeros on the right if the section is shorter than s; the "center" for color extraction is start + min(s//2, section_length-1), using the bottom row's value at that column.
 * Mask consistency requires all non-zero values in the extracted subgrid to be identical (same ID), otherwise it's marked invalid (id_val=-1, but still proceeds with empty mask); IDs map to type indices k only if consistent and non-zero.
 * Non-separator rows are strictly from row s to h-2 (excluding top s and bottom row), defined as having <= w/2 fives (float division, so tolerant of some 5s); these are used sequentially (up to s of them) as "placement rows" to assign types to local column positions within each section's effective range (start to start + min(s, length)).
 * Placement builds an s x s grid where each cell (p, local_col) gets the type k if a matching ID appears in the p-th placement row at a global column j within the k-th section's effective range; unassigned cells remain -1 and are skipped in output.
 * Output expansion tiles each mask into the larger grid at positions dictated by the placement grid, filling only where mask[local_r][local_c] != 0 with the type's color; assumes square output of size s*s x s*s, all initialized to 0.
 * Edge cases: If first section length=0 or no sections, outputs empty; if fewer than s placement rows, only uses available ones (rest unassigned); sections shorter than s get truncated masks; invalid (inconsistent) types are skipped in placement/mapping but their masks are still built (though unused); w may not be multiple of s, and sections may not cover full width.
 * Subtle: Color extraction uses bottom row (h-1), which must be valid index; out-of-bounds columns default to 0 for values; placement ignores 0s and 5s in middle rows, and skips if ID not mapped to a type; effective end for placement is start + min(s, length), so short sections limit local assignments even if placement row has values beyond.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it successfully handled all three training examples (outputs matched expected results, demonstrating correct parsing of sections, mask extraction with consistency, color assignment from bottom centers, selection of up to s non-separator middle rows, placement assignment within effective section ranges, and output expansion).
 * What worked: Section parsing and s computation correctly identified patterns in training inputs; mask building captured consistent IDs and padded appropriately; placement used sequential non-separator rows to map IDs to local positions without overstepping short sections; output tiling filled only masked areas with colors, leaving unplaced/empty areas as 0, which aligned with training expectations.
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the program produced a completely empty (all-0s) 25x25 grid (implying s=5, but no placements or masks applied), suggesting a failure in one of the early steps—possibly no valid sections (all top row 5s or first section length 0), no consistent IDs in top rows, no mapped types, no non-separator middle rows available, or all placements remaining -1 due to IDs not matching or positions outside effective ranges; this differs from training where structure was present, indicating the test may be an edge case like inconsistent masks, short/missing sections, or middle rows with too many 5s or unmapped values.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, as all provided functions align with the puzzle logic and worked for training; however, the consistency check in build_type_data may be too strict for test (invalidates types if any non-zero variance, leading to no id_to_type mappings and thus empty placement).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 25x25 grid entirely filled with 0s across all rows, which does not look correct—it lacks any colored or patterned structure, implying the program detected s=5 (since 5*5=25) but failed to place any masks (all placement cells likely remained -1, or no valid types/colors were extracted).
 * This is different from expected, as a valid puzzle test input should produce a composed grid with colored regions from the masks tiled according to middle-row placements (e.g., non-zero values in specific blocks); the all-0s suggests a breakdown like invalid/empty sections, no consistent mask IDs (all types skipped), or no usable middle rows (all separators or <s available), but without the test input grid visible, it's unclear if this is a program bug (e.g., over-strict consistency or range checks) or a true empty-case puzzle.
 * The output makes sense only if the test input has no valid sections or all elements invalid, but given training successes, it's likely incorrect handling of a subtle test variation (e.g., sections with mixed IDs, bottom row out-of-bounds centers, or middle rows with values outside effective ends); this needs fixing to populate at least some placements if partial data exists.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 12:17:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes an input grid to extract "types" of tile-like objects defined by sections in the top row (separated by 5s), builds s x s masks and colors for each type from the top and bottom of the grid, determines a placement grid from non-separator middle rows, and outputs an expanded s*s x s*s grid by tiling the masks according to the placement with their colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top row defines sections of consecutive non-5 values; the first section's length sets s (tile size), and sections are separated by 5s acting as dividers.
 * Masks for each type are extracted from the top min(s, h) rows within each section's columns, but only where values match a consistent ID (non-zero and uniform per mask); inconsistent or zero IDs make the type invalid (id_val=-1), but the code proceeds anyway, which can lead to empty or wrong masks.
 * Colors for types come from the bottom row (g[h-1]) at the "center" of each section (start + min(s//2, length-1)), defaulting to 0 if out of bounds.
 * Middle rows (from row s to h-2) are filtered to non-separator rows (those with <= w/2 fives); these are used sequentially (up to s rows) to fill an s x s placement grid by mapping values in those rows back to types via id_to_type, but only if the column j falls within a section's effective range (start to start + min(s, length)).
 * Effective section ends are min(s, length) to handle short sections; placements are local to the section (j - start), and unfilled placement spots remain -1 (leading to empty areas in output).
 * Output is built by placing each mask at placement[r][c] * s offsets, filling with the type's color only where mask[local_r][local_c] != 0; padding ensures all masks are s x s even if sections are shorter.
 * Trim trailing zero rows from input, but output can have leading zero rows/areas if placement or masks are empty/invalid.
 * Subtle: Assumes at least one section; if none or s=0, returns empty. Non-separator check uses <= w/2 fives (float division, so works for odd/even w). Placement only updates if val in id_to_type and j in effective range—unmapped vals or out-of-range are ignored, potentially leaving gaps.
 * Easy to miss: Masks are built with 1s where non-zero in input (but consistency checked separately); bottom colors can be 0, leading to invisible tiles. Middle rows are strictly from s to h-2 (excluding top s and bottom row). If fewer than s non-separator middle rows, placement is partially filled (higher p skipped).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Handles variable section lengths by padding columns but not always rows correctly (pads rows to s with zeros if h < s). Inconsistent types are flagged but still assigned masks (potentially wrong). No rotation/flipping of masks; assumes direct extraction.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def parse_sections(top_row: list[int]) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:
    """Parse top row into sections of consecutive non-5 values, returning list of (start, length)."""
    sections = []
    i = 0
    n = len(top_row)
    while i < n:
        if top_row[i] == 5:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        while i < n and top_row[i] != 5:
            i += 1
        length = i - start
        if length > 0:
            sections.append((start, length))
    return sections
```

```python
def is_non_separator_row(row: list[int], w: int) -> bool:
    """Check if row is not a separator (has <= w/2 fives)."""
    return sum(1 for x in row if x == 5) <= w / 2

def get_non_separator_middle_rows(g: list[list[int]], s: int, h: int, w: int) -> list[int]:
    """Get indices of non-separator rows from s to h-2 inclusive."""
    middle_non_sep = []
    for i in range(s, h - 1):
        if is_non_separator_row(g[i], w):
            middle_non_sep.append(i)
    return middle_non_sep
```

```python
def compute_section_eff_ends(starts: list[int], lengths: list[int], s: int) -> list[int]:
    """Compute effective end = start + min(s, length) for each section."""
    return [starts[k] + min(s, lengths[k]) for k in range(len(starts))]
```

(Note: build_type_data is helpful for mask/color extraction but has a bug in consistency handling—sets id_to_type only if consistent and id_val !=0, else -1, but still builds mask with 1s everywhere non-zero, which can include mixed values; useful but needs fix for invalid types. compute_placement and build_output_grid are core for placement and tiling but assume valid id_to_type.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission shown; no prior attempts detailed, but it correctly solved training examples 1-3 by accurately parsing sections, building consistent masks/colors, and placing them via middle rows to produce expected expanded grids.
 * Worked well for cases where sections are full-length (no short padding issues), IDs are consistent per type, and enough non-separator middle rows exist to fill placement.
 * Did not work for test input: Produced a 25x25 output (implying s=5), but top 5 rows are entirely zero (suggesting empty upper placement or failed mask placement), while lower rows show irregular patterns of 3s,4s,1s, and unexpectedly 6s (which may come from input bottom/middle but appear misaligned or overplaced).
 * Placement likely failed to fill upper parts due to insufficient or mismatched non-separator middle rows, or id_to_type missing mappings for some values (e.g., 6 not assigned to a type, but appearing in output via color? Wait, colors are from bottom, but 6s in output suggest either input has 6s placed directly or bug in build_output_grid).
 * Masks padding works for short sections but may cause overlaps/gaps if effective ends don't align with placement logic.
 * update_placement_for_row is helpful but skips if val not in id_to_type or j not in any effective range, leading to sparse placement in test (e.g., gaps filled with 0s).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but trim_trailing_zeros is minor/helpful for input cleaning; compute_s_and_starts assumes first section sets s, which worked for training but may fail if first section is invalid/short.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It's a 25x25 grid (s=5 implied), but the top 5 rows are entirely zeros, which shouldn't happen if placement uses middle rows to fill an s x s grid—suggests either no valid placements for upper rows (e.g., first few middle_non_sep rows have no mappable values in effective ranges) or masks are empty for those types.
 * Rows 6-10 show partial patterns (e.g., solid 3s left, sparse 4s/1s right), rows 11-15 more filled but irregular (full 4s/1s rows mixed with zeros), rows 16-20 introduce 6s in left/middle (possibly from a new type/color, but placement seems shifted downward), and rows 21-25 revert to patterns then all zeros—indicating incomplete or misordered placement (e.g., middle_non_sep not sorted/indexed correctly, or over-reliance on sequential p=0 to s-1 ignoring extras).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should be a clean tiled s x s blocks of colored masks without leading zero rows or sudden 6 introductions unless input defines a type with color 6; here, irregularity (e.g., non-blocky fills like [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,...] suggests partial mask placement or section overlap issues. Zeros in "filled" areas (e.g., row 6 has zeros between 3s and 4s) indicate unfilled placement spots or zeroed masks. Unknown why 6s appear in lower output if not properly typed (possibly bottom row has 6s assigned to a type but placement bug places it wrong). Overall, output is sparse/misaligned compared to training successes, missing full coverage.

[2025-10-02 12:17:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with colored cells (numbers 1-9 representing colors), separators (likely rows dominated by 5s acting as dividers), and sections defined by non-zero cells in the bottom row, where the goal is to transform input bands into output patterns that replicate or abstract specific motifs (e.g., full blocks, frames, or sparse designs) based on color dominance and positional rules, rearranged into a new grid structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input grids have variable heights and widths, with the bottom row containing key colors (non-zero values) that dictate output motifs for corresponding sections; sections are centered around these bottom-row positions, with width derived from spacing between centers (d-1, radius r=(w-1)//2).
 * Separators are rows with >50% cells equal to 5, dividing the grid (excluding bottom row) into "bands"; each band is processed independently, but the last band has special rules (e.g., reset to zero then apply color-based patterns like empty for 7, frame for <=5, full for >5).
 * Output is structured as num_bands * w rows by num_sections * w columns, where "significant fill" (>50% non-zero cells in a band-section overlap) triggers filling a w x w block with the section's color; however, this density check fails to capture pattern subtlety (e.g., borders/frames vs. full/solid).
 * Patterns are not always full blocks: expected outputs show frame-like borders (top/bottom full rows, sides only on edges for inner rows), sparse/dotted placements (e.g., alternating 0s and colors), or asymmetric motifs that don't match simple density thresholds.
 * Padding to square if out_h != out_w is a creative but unhelpful assumption; expected outputs are rectangular and not padded.
 * Color 7 often appears empty or as a frame base, but rules vary; last band overrides prior fills, suggesting hierarchical processing.
 * Subtle element: Outputs preserve aspect ratios and positions relative to sections, but rotate/orient/reinterpret band contents (e.g., Train 1 bottom band uses 6 as solid left, 7 as frame right; Train 2 inverts top/bottom with sparse 3/7 and full 9).
 * Easy to miss: Not all filled sections trigger solids—patterns may derive from the band's own structure (e.g., extracting borders from input shapes) rather than just color-filling; zero sections in bottom row imply empty blocks.
 * Bands exclude the bottom row; if no separators, single band spans to h-1.
 * Variable section widths if uneven spacing, but code assumes uniform d.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Function to detect separator rows (useful for band division, but threshold > w_grid/2.0 may need tuning for edge cases)
def get_separator_rows(g: List[List[int]], w_grid: int) -> List[int]:
    return [i for i in range(len(g) - 1) if sum(1 for x in g[i] if x == 5) > w_grid / 2.0]
```

```python
# Function to extract centers and colors from bottom row (core for section identification)
def get_centers_and_colors(last_row: List[int]) -> tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    centers = [j for j in range(len(last_row)) if last_row[j] != 0]
    colors = [last_row[j] for j in range(len(last_row)) if last_row[j] != 0]
    return centers, colors
```

```python
# Function to check significant fill in band-section overlap (helpful for deciding if to process, but flawed for pattern extraction—use as starting point for density)
def has_significant_fill(g: List[List[int]], b_start: int, b_end: int, s_start: int, s_end: int, w: int) -> bool:
    num_cells = (b_end - b_start) * w  # Note: w here should be s_end - s_start
    num_filled = sum(1 for ii in range(b_start, b_end) for jj in range(s_start, s_end) if g[ii][jj] != 0)
    return num_filled > num_cells / 2
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt correctly identifies bottom-row centers/colors and derives section ranges with radius-based widths, which aligns with section isolation but fails to apply them accurately across bands.
 * Band detection via separator rows works conceptually (divides into top/middle/bottom-like sections in Train 1/2), but ignores non-separator bands and mishandles last band by resetting everything to 0 then applying incomplete rules.
 * Significant fill check triggers full blocks for dense areas (e.g., Train 1 top band generates full 6/7/1 rows, matching expected density but not frame pattern), but doesn't detect or replicate borders/sparse motifs (e.g., Train 1 expected has [7,0,7,...] frames, generated has solids).
 * Special last-band handling attempts frames for color <=5 (e.g., Train 1 bottom generates partial frame for 1 but wrong color/placement; uses 6/1 instead of 6/7), but overrides prior bands incorrectly and ignores color=7 as empty.
 * Train 1: Generated full top block (6/7/1) and partial bottom frame, but expected alternates frames in middle band (7/1) and solid/frame bottom (6/7); mismatches colors (uses 1 instead of 7 in bottom right) and adds empty middle rows incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated full top (7/9/3) and partial bottom frame, but expected sparse/dotted top/middle (3/7 with 0s in checker-like pattern) and full bottom (9 with frame?); completely wrong orientation—expected inverts vertical stacking, and sparse patterns not captured (density check fails for low-fill motifs).
 * Train 3: Generated repeated full blocks (3/8/6) for top/bottom with empty middle, but expected complex multi-row patterns with interwoven 6/8 frames/sparses across larger width (25 cols?), including lower sections with 3/6 motifs; section_ranges likely too narrow (w=4? but expected spans more), leading to underfilled output; all-zero middle band correct in emptiness but not in structure.
 * Padding to square produces 9x9 for Train 1/2 (unneeded, expected 9x9 but rectangular intent) and 15x15 for Train 3 (mismatches expected ~25x20? with patterns); this distorts and adds zeros incorrectly.
 * Function `has_significant_fill` is partially helpful for density but broken for sparse/ frame detection (always binarizes to full/empty, missing patterns like borders); tune threshold or replace with pattern extraction (e.g., detect edges).
 * Overall, attempt understands band/section division (core structure) but misses pattern replication rules (e.g., copy/transform input shapes per section/color); no object extraction, so motifs like frames aren't isolated—consider adding blob/connected-component analysis.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is all zeros across a 15x30 grid (padded square?), which does not look correct—likely due to no significant fill detected in any band-section or empty bottom row/centers, but expected should have patterned blocks if input has colors (test input not shown, but assuming non-trivial, this indicates failure to process bands or extract colors).
 * All-zero output ignores any potential separators or bottom colors, suggesting broken edge-case handling (e.g., s=0 or no bands triggers empty, but puzzle likely requires patterned output even for sparse inputs); differs from training expects by lacking any color fills/frames.
 * Test output makes no sense for a visual puzzle—it's a blank canvas, missing all motif abstraction; to handle test, ensure fallback for low-density (e.g., extract borders regardless of >50% fill) and verify input parsing (e.g., if test has uneven sections or no 5s, single-band processing fails).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving decoding a compact grid into a larger output grid, where the top row defines equal-length sections separated by 5s, each section representing an s x s block with an ID and mask pattern, colors are sourced from the bottom row's centers, and middle rows (starting from row s+1) provide specifications for placing these block types into a larger s² x s² output by overlaying masks with corresponding colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Top row sections are contiguous non-5 values separated by 5s; they must all have the same length s for the puzzle to be valid, but the test input violates this, suggesting the code needs to handle or detect unequal lengths without crashing (e.g., perhaps select a common s or process variably sized sections).
 * Each section's s x s block (columns from section start) must have a consistent non-zero ID value across all non-zero cells to define the block type; masks are binary (1 where original value matches ID, 0 elsewhere), capturing the pattern/shape of that ID.
 * Colors for each block type come from the bottom row at the center column of each section (start + s//2); zero there is invalid.
 * Placement grid (s x s) is initialized to -1; middle spec rows (from row s+1 onward) overlay IDs onto this grid at local positions, with later rows overwriting earlier ones if conflicts arise ("last wins").
 * Output is an n x n grid (n = s * s), tiled by placing each specified block type's mask (scaled up by s in both dimensions) and filling matching positions with the block's color; empty placements (-1) are skipped, leaving 0s.
 * Edge cases: empty grid returns empty; sections with no length or inconsistent/empty IDs raise errors; center columns must not exceed grid width; middle spec rows may not fully exist (skipped if out of bounds), and columns may exceed width.
 * Subtle: Masks are built only from the first s rows and section columns, assuming the grid height R >= s; IDs in middle spec must map to existing types, or error.
 * Potential miss: If sections are unequal in test, the puzzle might imply dynamic s (e.g., max or average length) or different section interpretation (e.g., 5s as dividers but allowing variable sizes with padding).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The provided program correctly handled all three training examples, accurately parsing sections, building consistent masks and IDs, extracting colors, overlaying placements from middle specs (with last-wins resolution), and tiling the large output with colored masks, producing exact matches.
 * Failed on test input by raising "Unequal section lengths" error early, as it strictly requires all sections to have identical length s but the test has varying lengths, halting execution without generating output.
 * Section finding works well (skips 5s, collects starts/lengths), but assumes uniformity; no handling for variable lengths leads to crash.
 * Mask building and ID consistency checks are solid and essential, correctly identifying patterns in s x s blocks.
 * Color extraction from bottom-row centers is precise and error-checked, working as expected in trains.
 * Middle spec placement logic (starting at row s+1, mapping IDs to types, local positioning, overwriting) is correct but skips invalid rows/columns gracefully; however, relies on uniform s.
 * Output tiling scales masks correctly into n x n (n=s*s) by blocking placements, filling only mask=1 positions with colors, leaving 0s elsewhere—matches trains perfectly.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all components (section finding, mask/ID building, placement overlay, tiling) are relevant and mostly correct, but the equal-length enforcement is overly rigid for the test.
 * Overall, core decoding (sections -> IDs/masks -> colors -> placements -> tiled output) is well-understood, but misses subtlety of handling non-uniform sections in test.

**Test output:**
 * No output generated for test due to execution error ("Unequal section lengths"), so it does not make sense or match expected puzzle rules; the program crashes instead of producing a grid, indicating it can't handle the test's variable section lengths.
 * Expected output should be a large grid (likely based on some derived s, e.g., maximum length or per-section processing) with tiled colored masks placed according to middle specs, but error prevents any generation—difference is complete absence vs. a valid decoded image.
 * Test likely requires adapting s per section or selecting a global s (e.g., gcd or min length) to avoid error, as uniform assumption holds for trains but not test; without this, output can't be verified but visually should resemble expanded patterns from trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes an input grid to extract "types" of tile-like objects defined by sections in the top row (separated by 5s), builds s x s masks and colors for each type from the top and bottom of the grid, determines a placement grid from non-separator middle rows, and outputs an expanded s*s x s*s grid by tiling the masks according to the placement with their colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top row defines sections of consecutive non-5 values; the first section's length sets s (tile size), and sections are separated by 5s acting as dividers.
 * Masks for each type are extracted from the top min(s, h) rows within each section's columns, but only where values match a consistent ID (non-zero and uniform per mask); inconsistent or zero IDs make the type invalid (id_val=-1), but the code proceeds anyway, which can lead to empty or wrong masks.
 * Colors for types come from the bottom row (g[h-1]) at the "center" of each section (start + min(s//2, length-1)), defaulting to 0 if out of bounds.
 * Middle rows (from row s to h-2) are filtered to non-separator rows (those with <= w/2 fives); these are used sequentially (up to s rows) to fill an s x s placement grid by mapping values in those rows back to types via id_to_type, but only if the column j falls within a section's effective range (start to start + min(s, length)).
 * Effective section ends are min(s, length) to handle short sections; placements are local to the section (j - start), and unfilled placement spots remain -1 (leading to empty areas in output).
 * Output is built by placing each mask at placement[r][c] * s offsets, filling with the type's color only where mask[local_r][local_c] != 0; padding ensures all masks are s x s even if sections are shorter.
 * Trim trailing zero rows from input, but output can have leading zero rows/areas if placement or masks are empty/invalid.
 * Subtle: Assumes at least one section; if none or s=0, returns empty. Non-separator check uses <= w/2 fives (float division, so works for odd/even w). Placement only updates if val in id_to_type and j in effective range—unmapped vals or out-of-range are ignored, potentially leaving gaps.
 * Easy to miss: Masks are built with 1s where non-zero in input (but consistency checked separately); bottom colors can be 0, leading to invisible tiles. Middle rows are strictly from s to h-2 (excluding top s and bottom row). If fewer than s non-separator middle rows, placement is partially filled (higher p skipped).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown): Handles variable section lengths by padding columns but not always rows correctly (pads rows to s with zeros if h < s). Inconsistent types are flagged but still assigned masks (potentially wrong). No rotation/flipping of masks; assumes direct extraction.

```

(Note: build_type_data is helpful for mask/color extraction but has a bug in consistency handling—sets id_to_type only if consistent and id_val !=0, else -1, but still builds mask with 1s everywhere non-zero, which can include mixed values; useful but needs fix for invalid types. compute_placement and build_output_grid are core for placement and tiling but assume valid id_to_type.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission shown; no prior attempts detailed, but it correctly solved training examples 1-3 by accurately parsing sections, building consistent masks/colors, and placing them via middle rows to produce expected expanded grids.
 * Worked well for cases where sections are full-length (no short padding issues), IDs are consistent per type, and enough non-separator middle rows exist to fill placement.
 * Did not work for test input: Produced a 25x25 output (implying s=5), but top 5 rows are entirely zero (suggesting empty upper placement or failed mask placement), while lower rows show irregular patterns of 3s,4s,1s, and unexpectedly 6s (which may come from input bottom/middle but appear misaligned or overplaced).
 * Placement likely failed to fill upper parts due to insufficient or mismatched non-separator middle rows, or id_to_type missing mappings for some values (e.g., 6 not assigned to a type, but appearing in output via color? Wait, colors are from bottom, but 6s in output suggest either input has 6s placed directly or bug in build_output_grid).
 * Masks padding works for short sections but may cause overlaps/gaps if effective ends don't align with placement logic.
 * update_placement_for_row is helpful but skips if val not in id_to_type or j not in any effective range, leading to sparse placement in test (e.g., gaps filled with 0s).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but trim_trailing_zeros is minor/helpful for input cleaning; compute_s_and_starts assumes first section sets s, which worked for training but may fail if first section is invalid/short.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It's a 25x25 grid (s=5 implied), but the top 5 rows are entirely zeros, which shouldn't happen if placement uses middle rows to fill an s x s grid—suggests either no valid placements for upper rows (e.g., first few middle_non_sep rows have no mappable values in effective ranges) or masks are empty for those types.
 * Rows 6-10 show partial patterns (e.g., solid 3s left, sparse 4s/1s right), rows 11-15 more filled but irregular (full 4s/1s rows mixed with zeros), rows 16-20 introduce 6s in left/middle (possibly from a new type/color, but placement seems shifted downward), and rows 21-25 revert to patterns then all zeros—indicating incomplete or misordered placement (e.g., middle_non_sep not sorted/indexed correctly, or over-reliance on sequential p=0 to s-1 ignoring extras).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should be a clean tiled s x s blocks of colored masks without leading zero rows or sudden 6 introductions unless input defines a type with color 6; here, irregularity (e.g., non-blocky fills like [3,3,3,3,3,0,0,...] suggests partial mask placement or section overlap issues. Zeros in "filled" areas (e.g., row 6 has zeros between 3s and 4s) indicate unfilled placement spots or zeroed masks. Unknown why 6s appear in lower output if not properly typed (possibly bottom row has 6s assigned to a type but placement bug places it wrong). Overall, output is sparse/misaligned compared to training successes, missing full coverage.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid's top row defines sections of consecutive non-5 values to determine a size parameter s (from the first section's length), extract colored mask patterns (s x s) for each section from the top s rows (with consistency checks), and use selected middle rows (non-separator rows with few 5s) to determine placements of these masks into an s x s arrangement, which is then expanded into an s*s x s*s output grid filled with the corresponding colors where masks indicate presence.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Top row parsing identifies sections as runs of non-5 values separated by 5s; s is strictly the length of the very first such section, and all processing assumes at least one section exists (returns empty if none).
 * Masks are extracted from the top min(s, h) rows but padded to exactly s x s; for each section k, the mask covers only the first min(s, section_length) columns starting from the section's start position, with padding of zeros on the right if the section is shorter than s; the "center" for color extraction is start + min(s//2, section_length-1), using the bottom row's value at that column.
 * Mask consistency requires all non-zero values in the extracted subgrid to be identical (same ID), otherwise it's marked invalid (id_val=-1, but still proceeds with empty mask); IDs map to type indices k only if consistent and non-zero.
 * Non-separator rows are strictly from row s to h-2 (excluding top s and bottom row), defined as having <= w/2 fives (float division, so tolerant of some 5s); these are used sequentially (up to s of them) as "placement rows" to assign types to local column positions within each section's effective range (start to start + min(s, length)).
 * Placement builds an s x s grid where each cell (p, local_col) gets the type k if a matching ID appears in the p-th placement row at a global column j within the k-th section's effective range; unassigned cells remain -1 and are skipped in output.
 * Output expansion tiles each mask into the larger grid at positions dictated by the placement grid, filling only where mask[local_r][local_c] != 0 with the type's color; assumes square output of size s*s x s*s, all initialized to 0.
 * Edge cases: If first section length=0 or no sections, outputs empty; if fewer than s placement rows, only uses available ones (rest unassigned); sections shorter than s get truncated masks; invalid (inconsistent) types are skipped in placement/mapping but their masks are still built (though unused); w may not be multiple of s, and sections may not cover full width.
 * Subtle: Color extraction uses bottom row (h-1), which must be valid index; out-of-bounds columns default to 0 for values; placement ignores 0s and 5s in middle rows, and skips if ID not mapped to a type; effective end for placement is start + min(s, length), so short sections limit local assignments even if placement row has values beyond.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it successfully handled all three training examples (outputs matched expected results, demonstrating correct parsing of sections, mask extraction with consistency, color assignment from bottom centers, selection of up to s non-separator middle rows, placement assignment within effective section ranges, and output expansion).
 * What worked: Section parsing and s computation correctly identified patterns in training inputs; mask building captured consistent IDs and padded appropriately; placement used sequential non-separator rows to map IDs to local positions without overstepping short sections; output tiling filled only masked areas with colors, leaving unplaced/empty areas as 0, which aligned with training expectations.
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the program produced a completely empty (all-0s) 25x25 grid (implying s=5, but no placements or masks applied), suggesting a failure in one of the early steps—possibly no valid sections (all top row 5s or first section length 0), no consistent IDs in top rows, no mapped types, no non-separator middle rows available, or all placements remaining -1 due to IDs not matching or positions outside effective ranges; this differs from training where structure was present, indicating the test may be an edge case like inconsistent masks, short/missing sections, or middle rows with too many 5s or unmapped values.
 * No prior unhelpful functions noted, as all provided functions align with the puzzle logic and worked for training; however, the consistency check in build_type_data may be too strict for test (invalidates types if any non-zero variance, leading to no id_to_type mappings and thus empty placement).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 25x25 grid entirely filled with 0s across all rows, which does not look correct—it lacks any colored or patterned structure, implying the program detected s=5 (since 5*5=25) but failed to place any masks (all placement cells likely remained -1, or no valid types/colors were extracted).
 * This is different from expected, as a valid puzzle test input should produce a composed grid with colored regions from the masks tiled according to middle-row placements (e.g., non-zero values in specific blocks); the all-0s suggests a breakdown like invalid/empty sections, no consistent mask IDs (all types skipped), or no usable middle rows (all separators or <s available), but without the test input grid visible, it's unclear if this is a program bug (e.g., over-strict consistency or range checks) or a true empty-case puzzle.
 * The output makes sense only if the test input has no valid sections or all elements invalid, but given training successes, it's likely incorrect handling of a subtle test variation (e.g., sections with mixed IDs, bottom row out-of-bounds centers, or middle rows with values outside effective ends); this needs fixing to populate at least some placements if partial data exists.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 12:25:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid encodes assembly instructions for a larger s x s tiled output image, with s derived from the top row's first non-5 section length; the top row defines multiple tile types via sections separated by 5s, top s rows provide consistent-ID masks for each type, the bottom row gives colors for each type's center, and middle non-separator rows (with ≤ w/2 fives) dictate a s x s placement grid for these colored masked tiles, which are then composed into the full output without overlaps or empties.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Top row sections are consecutive non-5 values; s is the length of the first section (assuming all sections are multiples or at least s long, but code caps at min(s, length)); ignore empty sections or all-5 top rows.
 * Masks are extracted from the top min(s, h) rows, only within each section's columns (start to start + min(s, length) -1), marking 1 where non-zero values appear, but must be consistent (all non-zero vals in a mask must match a single ID); inconsistent or zero-ID masks are invalid (set to -1, but code proceeds anyway, which may cause skips).
 * Colors are taken from the bottom row (row h-1) at the "center" of each section: offset = min(s//2, length-1), so center = start + offset; if h=1 or out-of-bounds, default to 0.
 * Trim trailing all-zero rows before processing to find effective h, but don't trim leading zeros or non-trailing.
 * Middle rows for placement are from row s to h-2 (excluding top s and bottom 1), but only non-separator rows (sum of 5s ≤ w/2); use the first s such rows (or fewer if <s available) as sequential placement rows p=0 to s-1.
 * Placement: For each selected middle row, scan its non-0/non-5 values; if the value's ID maps to a valid type k (via id_to_type), find which section j it falls into (start_j ≤ col < start_j + min(s, length_j)), then set placement[p][local_col = col - start_j] = k; if not in any effective section range, skip (leaves -1).
 * Output composition: s*s x s*s grid; for each placement[r][c] = k (if valid 0≤k<num_types), overlay the k-th mask (s x s, padded if needed) with its color at global position (r*s + local_r, c*s + local_c), but only where mask[local_r][local_c] !=0; no blending—last overlay wins, but code doesn't handle overlaps explicitly.
 * Subtle: Sections may have length <s (code pads masks with zero columns on right); if num_types !=s or placement has many -1s, output will have empty/unfilled areas; assume at least one section and s>0, else return empty.
 * Edge cases: If h < s+1, middle rows may be empty (placement all -1); if no non-separator middles, placement empty; bottom color may be 0 if no bottom row; IDs must be consistent per mask, else skip that type.
 * Output should be fully dense if placement is complete, no all-zero rows/sections unless input dictates; trim only input, not output.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission shown; it correctly handled all three training examples, indicating solid grasp of section parsing, mask building, placement logic, and output composition for those cases.
 * Worked: Trimming trailing zeros, parsing sections accurately, computing s and starts, building consistent masks with padding, color extraction from bottom centers, selecting first s non-separator middle rows, updating placement only within effective section ranges, and overlaying masks without blending.
 * Didn't work: In the test case, placement likely failed to fill many positions (many -1s), leading to incomplete tiles; masks may not have been consistently ID-matched or sections misaligned, causing skips; non-separator detection or middle row selection might have selected too few rows (<s), leaving top placement rows empty.
 * Function `build_type_data` is helpful but has a flaw: it sets id_to_type only if consistent and id_val !=0, but proceeds with id_val=-1 for masks, which causes types to be skipped in placement/output (good for invalid, but may invalidate whole types prematurely).
 * Function `compute_placement` and `update_placement_for_row` are essential and worked for training, but in test, they left many -1s, suggesting ID-to-type mapping missed some values or sections didn't cover all relevant columns in middle rows.
 * Function `build_output_grid` is correct but reveals underfilled placement: if placement has -1s, output areas stay 0, which happened extensively.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem relevant, though `compute_section_eff_ends` is a simple helper and could be inlined.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it's a 25x25 grid (implying s=5), but the top 5 rows are entirely zeros, suggesting the first placement row (p=0) was all -1s or no masks placed there, which shouldn't happen if middle rows provided placements—likely too few non-separator middle rows or all placements skipped due to invalid IDs/sections.
 * Rows 6-10 (first "block" of 5) show partial patterns of 3s (left, like a mask), 4s (middle, sparse), 1s (right, partial), but with many zeros interrupting, indicating incomplete mask overlays or padding issues; e.g., row 6 has 3s in cols 0-4, zeros 5-9, sparse 4s in 10-14, partial 1s in 15-24—not a full tiled composition.
 * Rows 11-15 repeat similar partial 3/4/1 patterns but denser in some places (e.g., row 12 full 4s in 10-14), yet still zeros in blocks, and no coherent s x s tiles visible—expected full colored regions without zero gaps inside tiles.
 * Rows 16-20 introduce 6s in left/middle (e.g., row 16 full 6s in 5-14), mixed with 4s/1s, but again sparse/zero-filled (e.g., row 18 has isolated 6s and 4s), differing from expectation of solid mask-based fills; this suggests placement for lower rows used different types (maybe 6 as a new ID/color), but masks weren't fully applied or colors mismatched.
 * Rows 21-25 mirror rows 16-20 but fade to zeros (e.g., row 21 full 6s but row 25 all zeros except left 3s), indicating last placement rows had empty or partial placements—overall, output looks like fragmented, downward-shifting patterns rather than a stable s x s assembly of complete tiles, so it's clearly wrong and missing full coverage.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (no exceptions). I focused only on properties like color, position (bbox), holes, and pixels that demonstrably influence or connect to other elements in the outputs. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated input shapes with no apparent effect on outputs, like some upper single pixels not tied to bottom propagation) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., sporadic color mappings or hole creations without clear triggers) are noted as unknown where they cannot be reliably connected.

#### 1. **Bottom-Row Single-Pixel Colors (Position → Output Color Override)**
   - **Description**: Single-pixel elements (pixels=1, holes=0) at the highest y-coordinates (bottom row: y=9 in trains 1-2, y=13 in train 3) with non-orange colors (e.g., Pink, Dark Red, Blue, Green, Light Blue, Maroon) directly determine the color of output shapes. These "seed" colors override and propagate to entire merged regions upward.
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Seed position (x-coordinate in bottom row) influences the horizontal span (x-range) of the corresponding output shape's bbox, often aligning with vertical "columns" or sections divided by orange elements.
     - No output shape uses orange; all output colors match exactly from these bottom seeds (e.g., train 1: Pink/Dark Red/Blue seeds → Pink/Dark Red/Blue outputs; train 2: Dark Red/Light Blue/Green → same; train 3: Green/Maroon/Pink → same).
     - Consistent across all: Each bottom seed color appears in at least one output shape, with no extraneous colors introduced.
   - **Affected Properties**: Input color/position → output color; seeds do not retain their single-pixel form but expand.

#### 2. **Orange Components (Adjacency/Position → Merging and Absorption)**
   - **Description**: All orange elements (single pixels or multi-pixel shapes, holes=0, various bbox sizes) act as connectors or neutral pathways, enabling merging of adjacent non-orange components into larger output shapes. Oranges are consistently absorbed/overwritten and do not appear in any output.
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Orange positions (e.g., vertical/horizontal lines at x=0/10 or y=3/7 in trains 1-2) define boundaries or bridges between sections; adjacent non-orange shapes merge across these if influenced by the same bottom seed color.
     - Leads to bbox expansion in outputs: Output bboxes encompass multiple input oranges + adjacent colored shapes (e.g., train 1: oranges at [2,2,4,4]/[6,2,8,4] connect Blue/Yellow inputs into single Blue output [3,0,8,5]).
     - Pixel contribution: Input orange pixels are added to output pixel counts during merging but do not affect color or holes independently.
     - Consistent across all: Every input has numerous oranges (dozens of pixels total); outputs have zero orange, with merged pixels approximating sums of oranges + connected non-oranges (e.g., train 2: ~20 orange pixels absorbed into Green/Dark Red/Light Blue outputs).
   - **Affected Properties**: Orange position/adjacency/pixels → output bbox expansion and pixel summation; enables color propagation from bottom seeds through orange-linked paths.

#### 3. **Input Non-Orange Shapes (Bbox Overlap/Adjacency → Output Merging and Pixel/Hole Inheritance)**
   - **Description**: Larger non-orange input shapes (e.g., Red/Blue/Yellow with pixels>1, various holes/bbox) merge with adjacent elements (via oranges or direct proximity) into outputs, contributing their area and structure upward from bottom seeds.
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Bbox proximity or overlap with orange paths or other non-oranges leads to combined output bboxes that vertically span from bottom seeds upward (e.g., train 3: multiple Red/Yellow/Blue inputs across y=0-11 merge into tall Maroon/Pink/Green outputs spanning y=0-24).
     - Pixel summation: Output pixels ≈ sum of merged input pixels (non-oranges + absorbed oranges), with minor deductions possibly for overlaps (consistent: train 1 Blue output 21px ≈ 8+3+1+5+5-1; train 2 Light Blue 16px ≈ sum of ~5-6 small inputs + oranges; train 3 Pink 119px ≈ sum of ~10+ inputs).
     - Hole inheritance: Input holes (where present) often carry over to outputs in merged regions (e.g., train 1: input Blue hole=1 → output Blue hole=1; train 2: input Red hole=1 contributes to Light Blue hole=2 via merging). However, exact mechanism for hole count (e.g., addition vs. creation) is unknown—not consistently explainable without forcing patterns (e.g., some hole=0 inputs gain holes in outputs).
     - Consistent across all: Only non-orange inputs with bbox adjacency to orange paths or bottom-influenced sections contribute; isolated upper non-oranges (e.g., some Yellow in train 1) are absorbed if connected, but no standalone preservation.
   - **Affected Properties**: Input bbox/pixels/holes + adjacency → output bbox/pixels (summation); partial hole carryover (unknown full transformation rule).

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Connections
- **Hole Creation/Modification**: While holes are inherited in some merges (consistent carryover), new holes appear in outputs without a clear, consistent trigger (e.g., train 1: input Red hole=0 → output Dark Red hole=1; not replicated in train 2's Green hole=0 from hole=0 input). Cannot connect to a specific property like position or color adjacency without speculation.
- **Exact Horizontal Merging Boundaries**: Bottom seed x-position influences output x-span, but why some outputs span multiple "columns" (e.g., train 1 Blue [3,0,8,5] crosses mid-section) vs. staying narrow (e.g., train 2 Green [0,3,2,5]) is not consistently tied to a single property like pixel count or hole presence.
- **Color-Specific Interactions**: Bottom seeds override inputs uniformly (consistent), but no consistent sub-rule for why one seed dominates a region over another (e.g., competition between adjacent seeds) is observable across all trains.

These connections focus solely on interactions evident in the data; no high-level puzzle interpretation or full transformation rule is inferred. If more examples were provided, additional consistencies might emerge.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (no exceptions). I focused only on properties like color, position (bbox), holes, and pixels that demonstrably influence or connect to other elements in the outputs. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated input shapes with no apparent effect on outputs, like some upper single pixels not tied to bottom propagation) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., sporadic color mappings or hole creations without clear triggers) are noted as unknown where they cannot be reliably connected.

#### 1. **Bottom-Row Single-Pixel Colors (Position → Output Color Override)**
   - **Description**: Single-pixel elements (pixels=1, holes=0) at the highest y-coordinates (bottom row: y=9 in trains 1-2, y=13 in train 3) with non-orange colors (e.g., Pink, Dark Red, Blue, Green, Light Blue, Maroon) directly determine the color of output shapes. These "seed" colors override and propagate to entire merged regions upward.
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Seed position (x-coordinate in bottom row) influences the horizontal span (x-range) of the corresponding output shape's bbox, often aligning with vertical "columns" or sections divided by orange elements.
     - No output shape uses orange; all output colors match exactly from these bottom seeds (e.g., train 1: Pink/Dark Red/Blue seeds → Pink/Dark Red/Blue outputs; train 2: Dark Red/Light Blue/Green → same; train 3: Green/Maroon/Pink → same).
     - Consistent across all: Each bottom seed color appears in at least one output shape, with no extraneous colors introduced.
   - **Affected Properties**: Input color/position → output color; seeds do not retain their single-pixel form but expand.

#### 2. **Orange Components (Adjacency/Position → Merging and Absorption)**
   - **Description**: All orange elements (single pixels or multi-pixel shapes, holes=0, various bbox sizes) act as connectors or neutral pathways, enabling merging of adjacent non-orange components into larger output shapes. Oranges are consistently absorbed/overwritten and do not appear in any output.
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Orange positions (e.g., vertical/horizontal lines at x=0/10 or y=3/7 in trains 1-2) define boundaries or bridges between sections; adjacent non-orange shapes merge across these if influenced by the same bottom seed color.
     - Leads to bbox expansion in outputs: Output bboxes encompass multiple input oranges + adjacent colored shapes (e.g., train 1: oranges at [2,2,4,4]/[6,2,8,4] connect Blue/Yellow inputs into single Blue output [3,0,8,5]).
     - Pixel contribution: Input orange pixels are added to output pixel counts during merging but do not affect color or holes independently.
     - Consistent across all: Every input has numerous oranges (dozens of pixels total); outputs have zero orange, with merged pixels approximating sums of oranges + connected non-oranges (e.g., train 2: ~20 orange pixels absorbed into Green/Dark Red/Light Blue outputs).
   - **Affected Properties**: Orange position/adjacency/pixels → output bbox expansion and pixel summation; enables color propagation from bottom seeds through orange-linked paths.

#### 3. **Input Non-Orange Shapes (Bbox Overlap/Adjacency → Output Merging and Pixel/Hole Inheritance)**
   - **Description**: Larger non-orange input shapes (e.g., Red/Blue/Yellow with pixels>1, various holes/bbox) merge with adjacent elements (via oranges or direct proximity) into outputs, contributing their area and structure upward from bottom seeds.
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Bbox proximity or overlap with orange paths or other non-oranges leads to combined output bboxes that vertically span from bottom seeds upward (e.g., train 3: multiple Red/Yellow/Blue inputs across y=0-11 merge into tall Maroon/Pink/Green outputs spanning y=0-24).
     - Pixel summation: Output pixels ≈ sum of merged input pixels (non-oranges + absorbed oranges), with minor deductions possibly for overlaps (consistent: train 1 Blue output 21px ≈ 8+3+1+5+5-1; train 2 Light Blue 16px ≈ sum of ~5-6 small inputs + oranges; train 3 Pink 119px ≈ sum of ~10+ inputs).
     - Hole inheritance: Input holes (where present) often carry over to outputs in merged regions (e.g., train 1: input Blue hole=1 → output Blue hole=1; train 2: input Red hole=1 contributes to Light Blue hole=2 via merging). However, exact mechanism for hole count (e.g., addition vs. creation) is unknown—not consistently explainable without forcing patterns (e.g., some hole=0 inputs gain holes in outputs).
     - Consistent across all: Only non-orange inputs with bbox adjacency to orange paths or bottom-influenced sections contribute; isolated upper non-oranges (e.g., some Yellow in train 1) are absorbed if connected, but no standalone preservation.
   - **Affected Properties**: Input bbox/pixels/holes + adjacency → output bbox/pixels (summation); partial hole carryover (unknown full transformation rule).

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Connections
- **Hole Creation/Modification**: While holes are inherited in some merges (consistent carryover), new holes appear in outputs without a clear, consistent trigger (e.g., train 1: input Red hole=0 → output Dark Red hole=1; not replicated in train 2's Green hole=0 from hole=0 input). Cannot connect to a specific property like position or color adjacency without speculation.
- **Exact Horizontal Merging Boundaries**: Bottom seed x-position influences output x-span, but why some outputs span multiple "columns" (e.g., train 1 Blue [3,0,8,5] crosses mid-section) vs. staying narrow (e.g., train 2 Green [0,3,2,5]) is not consistently tied to a single property like pixel count or hole presence.
- **Color-Specific Interactions**: Bottom seeds override inputs uniformly (consistent), but no consistent sub-rule for why one seed dominates a region over another (e.g., competition between adjacent seeds) is observable across all trains.

These connections focus solely on interactions evident in the data; no high-level puzzle interpretation or full transformation rule is inferred. If more examples were provided, additional consistencies might emerge.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: list index out of range
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 12:38:33] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors or pixel values) where the bottom row acts as a "seed" or key to identify and extract specific sections or objects (blobs/shapes) from the upper rows, then rearrange or recolor them into a new composite output grid, often padded to a square shape. The goal is to produce exact matching patterns that preserve internal structures (like 0s for empty spaces) while applying colors from the seeds, but the previous program incorrectly splits and overfills sections, leading to distorted shapes and extra padding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The bottom row (g[-1]) contains "seeds" which are non-zero, non-5 values indicating colors for specific objects or sections; positions matter for locating where to extract from the upper grid (g[:-1]), but 0s and 5s are likely backgrounds or separators that must be preserved or ignored selectively.
 * Sections are not simple vertical splits based on averaging seed positions; instead, they seem to involve extracting contiguous "blobs" or connected components of matching colors from the full grid, guided by seed positions, and possibly rotating, stacking, or concatenating them horizontally/vertically while maintaining their internal patterns (e.g., 0s as holes or edges).
 * Outputs must be padded to a square (max(h, w) size) with 0s, but only after correctly assembling the core content; over-padding or incorrect concatenation leads to empty rows/columns that don't match expectations.
 * Subtle elements: Preserve 0s within shapes (they represent transparency or holes, not to be filled); do not fill everything with the seed color indiscriminately—internal non-background values should stay unless recolored specifically. Seeds might indicate multiple objects per color, requiring separate extractions. Width varies across examples (e.g., 9 in ex1, 9 in ex2, 25? in ex3), so handle dynamic sizing. The expected outputs show stacked or side-by-side shapes (e.g., 7-blob, 1-blob, 6-blob in ex1) that appear "lifted" or rearranged from the input, suggesting object detection rather than crude slicing.
 * Error handling: Programs must avoid index errors (e.g., on empty or short grids/seeds); test input likely has unique seed patterns (e.g., fewer seeds or irregular positions) causing crashes.
 * Across attempts: No successful matches, but bottom-row analysis is key; ignore 5s as they might be invalid or dividers. Outputs often have correct colors present but wrong spatial arrangement (e.g., blobs smeared or misaligned).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_seeds(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """
    Extracts non-0, non-5 values from the bottom row with their column indices.
    Helpful for identifying color seeds and positions, but needs refinement to handle multiple per color or overlaps.
    """
    last = g[-1]
    return [(last[j], j) for j in range(len(last)) if last[j] != 0 and last[j] != 5]
```

```python
def extract_sections(g: List[List[int]], seps: List[int], width: int) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    """
    Splits upper grid (g[:-1]) into horizontal sections based on bounds from separators.
    Partially useful for dividing the grid, but broken for non-uniform blobs—leads to incorrect slicing that cuts through shapes.
    """
    bounds = [0] + seps + [width]
    sections = []
    for i in range(len(bounds) - 1):
        start, end = bounds[i], bounds[i + 1]
        sec = [row[start:end] for row in g[:-1]]
        sections.append(sec)
    return sections
```

```python
def concatenate_sections(colored_sections: List[List[List[int]]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Horizontally concatenates sections row-wise.
    Useful for assembling output, but assumes equal heights and correct ordering; doesn't handle vertical stacking needed in some cases.
    """
    if not colored_sections:
        return []
    num_rows = len(colored_sections[0])
    return [sum((sec[r] for sec in colored_sections), []) for r in range(num_rows)]
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def find_separators(seeds: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Averages x-positions of consecutive seeds for split points.
    Broken: Assumes sorted linear positions and uniform sections, but examples show irregular blob extractions (e.g., ex1 has overlapping or non-adjacent seeds), leading to wrong bounds.
    """
    xs = [x for _, x in seeds]
    return [(xs[i] + xs[i + 1]) // 2 for i in range(len(xs) - 1)]
```

```python
def colorize(section: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Fills section with seed color except for 0s and 5s.
    Not helpful/broken: Over-fills everything (ignores internal structure), but expectations preserve patterns like sparse 0s in blobs (e.g., ex1's 7-blob has internal 0s); turns shapes into solid blocks, distorting outputs.
    """
    return [[color if c != 0 and c != 5 else 0 for c in row] for row in section]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies seeds from the bottom row (e.g., captures colors like 6,7,1 in ex1) and attempts sectioning/concatenation/padding, showing basic understanding of using g[-1] as a key and producing a square output.
 * What worked: Seed extraction places correct colors in output (e.g., 6,7,1 appear in generated ex1); concatenation logic assembles something grid-like; padding to square is implemented, matching output dimensions in examples.
 * What didn't work: Section splitting via separators is too simplistic—averaging positions cuts grids incorrectly (e.g., ex1 generated has 6-blob split and misplaced, with extra 0s; expected has intact 7-blob on left, 1-blob middle, 6-blob bottom-right). Colorize overfills sections into solids, erasing internal 0-patterns (e.g., ex1 generated fills 7-area solidly, but expected has dotted 0s like [7,0,7]); results in smeared/wrong shapes (ex1: 6s on top-left instead of bottom; ex2: 9s and 3s misaligned, missing stacked order; ex3: massive distortion with 3s/8s/6s scattered, ignoring long horizontal 8-blob).
 * Ex1 differences: Generated has horizontal 6/7/1 bars on top with padding below, but expected stacks 7/1 vertically then 6 below, preserving sparse patterns (e.g., expected row1: [7,7,7,1,1,1,1,1,1] vs generated [6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,1,1,1]—wrong starting color and no full 1-extension).
 * Ex2 differences: Generated jumbles 7/9/3 horizontally with duplicates/errors (e.g., row1 [0,7,0,0,9,9,9,0,3,0,3] has isolated 7/3), but expected stacks 3/7 vertically then 9 below, with specific 0-holes (e.g., expected row1 [3,0,3,0,0,0,0,7,0] vs generated—extra 9s early, missing vertical alignment).
 * Ex3 differences: Generated produces a narrow, vertical mess with 3/8/6 scattered and heavy padding (17 rows, but only ~6 used), but expected is wider (25 cols?) with layered 6/8/3 blobs stacked vertically across multiple sections, preserving complex 0-patterns (e.g., expected has long 8-chains with 0-interrupts; generated chops them into small pieces like [3,3,3,0,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,6,0,0,6]).
 * Overall: No training example matches (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial grasp of seeds and assembly but misses blob connectivity, pattern preservation, and correct ordering/placement—likely needs connected-component detection instead of slicing.
 * Padding adds too many empty rows early (e.g., ex1 has 3 empty rows mid-grid), suggesting concatenation fails on heights.

**Test output:**
 * The test output results in an ERROR (list index out of range), indicating the program crashes—likely in find_separators (dividing by zero or accessing empty xs if no/insufficient seeds) or extract_sections (bad bounds on test input's width/seeds). This does not make sense or look correct, as a valid solution must execute without errors; it suggests the splitting logic fails on edge cases like single seed, unsorted positions, or shorter bottom row, preventing any output comparison. To handle test, need robust seed/separator logic (e.g., sort seeds by position, handle 0/1 seed cases) and bounds checks; expected test output likely follows similar stacking/preservation rules but with unique colors/shapes (e.g., irregular blobs), so current approach can't produce it.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 12:38:51] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 12:41:18] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions/connections** observed across **all three train examples**. These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case (e.g., via position, color propagation, merging, or structural linking). I focused only on elements with clear, repeatable effects on transformations from input to output. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., small accents like yellow pixels at arbitrary positions not tied to merging; black elements or frames, which appear static and non-transforming) are excluded. Inconsistent interactions (e.g., hole counts that do not reliably propagate or add in a fixed way; pixel counts that vary in summation logic) are noted as unknown where applicable. No high-level puzzle solution or test input analysis is included, as per instructions.

1. **Orange structural elements (connectors) ↔ Top-row colored blocks (red/blue/yellow variants)**  
   - **Description**: Orange elements (single-pixel dots at edge positions like x=0/10/11, y=0/3/5/7/8/11; 5-pixel shapes in bbox ~[2-4,2-4]/[6-8,2-4]/[2-4,6-8]/[6-8,6-8] or scaled equivalents) consistently act as vertical/horizontal links between top-row blocks (larger ~3x3 bboxes at y=0-2/4, x~0/4-6/8-10, colors red/blue/yellow, 5-9 pixels, 0-1 holes) and lower grid areas.  
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These orange connectors enable spatial merging of top blocks into output shapes, expanding their bboxes downward (e.g., top blocks at y=0-2 extend to y=5-8 in outputs). Consistent across all trains: output bboxes overlap orange connector positions, suggesting orange facilitates position-based transformation (e.g., top-left red block bbox [0,0,2,2] links via left orange to output [0,0,2,2] or [0,6,2,8]). No color change from orange itself, but it affects block movement/expansion.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Present and linking in every input; absent in outputs (oranges "dissolve" into merged shapes).

2. **Bottom-row single-pixel accents ↔ Output region colors and positions**  
   - **Description**: Single-pixel elements (1 pixel, no holes, colors varying per example: pink/dark red/blue at x~1/5/9 y=9; dark red/light blue/green at x~1/5/9 y=9; green/maroon/pink at x~2/8/14 y=13) positioned at the bottom row.  
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These directly determine the primary colors of output elements, propagating upward to fill large regions (e.g., left bottom color → left/lower output shape; center → middle output; right → right/lower output). Output elements match these colors exactly (or close variants like light blue) and have bboxes aligned to the corresponding horizontal section (e.g., left x~0-2/5, center x~3-8/5-14, right x~6-8/9-24). Consistent across all trains: each bottom color appears in 1-3 output elements, with total output pixel count scaled up from the single pixel (e.g., pink 1px input → 9px/119px output). Position of bottom pixel affects output bbox start/end (e.g., x=1 bottom → output bbox x=0 start).  
   - **Consistency Note**: Every output is dominated by the three bottom colors (no other input colors persist unchanged); this is the only consistent color source for outputs.

3. **Top-row colored blocks (red/blue/yellow) ↔ Bottom-row accents (color modification)**  
   - **Description**: Top blocks (as in #1) interact specifically with bottom accents (as in #2) via overlapping sections.  
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Bottom accent colors modify top block colors in outputs, often darkening or variant-shifting (e.g., input red interacts with bottom dark red/maroon → output dark red/maroon; input blue/yellow may merge into bottom-influenced blue/green/light blue). This affects ~50-70% of output elements, with modified colors gaining holes (0→1 or 1→1 preserved in some cases). Consistent across all trains: red-top blocks always transform to a darker red variant (dark red/maroon) in output when bottom includes dark red/maroon; blue/yellow blocks merge into bottom colors without preserving their original hue. Position alignment: left top ↔ left bottom, etc.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Red modification is fixed (red input + dark red bottom → dark red output in all three); other color merges (e.g., yellow → green/blue) vary by bottom color, but always subordinate to bottom influence. Unknown: exact trigger for hole addition during modification (occurs consistently but not explainable from input holes alone).

4. **Orange connectors ↔ Pixel count aggregation in outputs**  
   - **Description**: Orange elements (as in #1) overlap with top blocks and bottom accents spatially.  
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Orange pixels contribute to output pixel counts during merging, adding ~5-20% to top block pixels (e.g., input top block 7-9px + nearby orange 5px → output 8-21px). Consistent across all trains: output pixels per element are 1.5-3x input top block pixels in connected areas, with bbox expansion matching orange-linked paths (e.g., vertical orange at x=2-4/6-8 pulls top y=0-2 down to y=5-8). No direct color effect from orange.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Aggregation scale is consistent (outputs total ~40-200px vs. inputs ~50-100px, preserving mass via orange links); isolated input pixels (non-orange/top/bottom) do not aggregate.

5. **Position (bbox) ↔ Hole presence in merged outputs**  
   - **Description**: Bbox positions of top blocks and orange connectors.  
   - **Interaction/Effect**: When top block bboxes overlap orange paths leading to bottom accents, outputs gain/create holes (1-13 total, often 1 per small element). Consistent across all trains: Merged output bboxes (e.g., [3,0,8,5] or [0,0,14,24]) inherit input bbox starts but expand via orange positions, introducing holes at intersection points (e.g., input hole=1 at [4,0,6,2] → output hole=1 at encompassing [3,0,8,5]; holeless inputs gain 1 hole post-merge). Bottom accent positions indirectly affect hole placement (e.g., center bottom → central output holes).  
   - **Consistency Note**: Every output element in a merged bbox has ≥1 hole if it covers an input hole or orange intersection; solid (hole=0) outputs only for non-merged bottom-influenced areas (e.g., train2 green). Unknown: precise hole count formula (adds inconsistently, e.g., 1 input hole → 1 or 2 output holes).

### Notes on Limitations
- **Unknown/Non-Consistent Elements**: Small mid-grid accents (e.g., yellow [4,4,4,5] p=2 in train2; blue [6,9,7,10] p=3 in train3) do not consistently interact—they appear in inputs but are absent or untraceable in outputs, suggesting irrelevance or non-propagating. Color gradients/marbles (mentioned in description) are not evident in data (all elements single-color). No consistent black element interaction (static, no bbox/pixel change). Test inputs follow similar structure but no outputs provided for verification.
- **No Forced Connections**: Only listed what is directly observable and repeats in every train (e.g., no semantic shape meanings like "L-shape rotation" as bbox/pixels don't support it consistently). Total transformation mechanism (e.g., why some merges horizontal vs. vertical) remains unknown.

[2025-10-02 12:41:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions/connections** observed across **all three train examples**. These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case (e.g., via position, color propagation, merging, or structural linking). I focused only on elements with clear, repeatable effects on transformations from input to output. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., small accents like yellow pixels at arbitrary positions not tied to merging; black elements or frames, which appear static and non-transforming) are excluded. Inconsistent interactions (e.g., hole counts that do not reliably propagate or add in a fixed way; pixel counts that vary in summation logic) are noted as unknown where applicable. No high-level puzzle solution or test input analysis is included, as per instructions.

1. **Orange structural elements (connectors) ↔ Top-row colored blocks (red/blue/yellow variants)**  
   - **Description**: Orange elements (single-pixel dots at edge positions like x=0/10/11, y=0/3/5/7/8/11; 5-pixel shapes in bbox ~[2-4,2-4]/[6-8,2-4]/[2-4,6-8]/[6-8,6-8] or scaled equivalents) consistently act as vertical/horizontal links between top-row blocks (larger ~3x3 bboxes at y=0-2/4, x~0/4-6/8-10, colors red/blue/yellow, 5-9 pixels, 0-1 holes) and lower grid areas.  
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These orange connectors enable spatial merging of top blocks into output shapes, expanding their bboxes downward (e.g., top blocks at y=0-2 extend to y=5-8 in outputs). Consistent across all trains: output bboxes overlap orange connector positions, suggesting orange facilitates position-based transformation (e.g., top-left red block bbox [0,0,2,2] links via left orange to output [0,0,2,2] or [0,6,2,8]). No color change from orange itself, but it affects block movement/expansion.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Present and linking in every input; absent in outputs (oranges "dissolve" into merged shapes).

2. **Bottom-row single-pixel accents ↔ Output region colors and positions**  
   - **Description**: Single-pixel elements (1 pixel, no holes, colors varying per example: pink/dark red/blue at x~1/5/9 y=9; dark red/light blue/green at x~1/5/9 y=9; green/maroon/pink at x~2/8/14 y=13) positioned at the bottom row.  
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These directly determine the primary colors of output elements, propagating upward to fill large regions (e.g., left bottom color → left/lower output shape; center → middle output; right → right/lower output). Output elements match these colors exactly (or close variants like light blue) and have bboxes aligned to the corresponding horizontal section (e.g., left x~0-2/5, center x~3-8/5-14, right x~6-8/9-24). Consistent across all trains: each bottom color appears in 1-3 output elements, with total output pixel count scaled up from the single pixel (e.g., pink 1px input → 9px/119px output). Position of bottom pixel affects output bbox start/end (e.g., x=1 bottom → output bbox x=0 start).  
   - **Consistency Note**: Every output is dominated by the three bottom colors (no other input colors persist unchanged); this is the only consistent color source for outputs.

3. **Top-row colored blocks (red/blue/yellow) ↔ Bottom-row accents (color modification)**  
   - **Description**: Top blocks (as in #1) interact specifically with bottom accents (as in #2) via overlapping sections.  
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Bottom accent colors modify top block colors in outputs, often darkening or variant-shifting (e.g., input red interacts with bottom dark red/maroon → output dark red/maroon; input blue/yellow may merge into bottom-influenced blue/green/light blue). This affects ~50-70% of output elements, with modified colors gaining holes (0→1 or 1→1 preserved in some cases). Consistent across all trains: red-top blocks always transform to a darker red variant (dark red/maroon) in output when bottom includes dark red/maroon; blue/yellow blocks merge into bottom colors without preserving their original hue. Position alignment: left top ↔ left bottom, etc.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Red modification is fixed (red input + dark red bottom → dark red output in all three); other color merges (e.g., yellow → green/blue) vary by bottom color, but always subordinate to bottom influence. Unknown: exact trigger for hole addition during modification (occurs consistently but not explainable from input holes alone).

4. **Orange connectors ↔ Pixel count aggregation in outputs**  
   - **Description**: Orange elements (as in #1) overlap with top blocks and bottom accents spatially.  
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Orange pixels contribute to output pixel counts during merging, adding ~5-20% to top block pixels (e.g., input top block 7-9px + nearby orange 5px → output 8-21px). Consistent across all trains: output pixels per element are 1.5-3x input top block pixels in connected areas, with bbox expansion matching orange-linked paths (e.g., vertical orange at x=2-4/6-8 pulls top y=0-2 down to y=5-8). No direct color effect from orange.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Aggregation scale is consistent (outputs total ~40-200px vs. inputs ~50-100px, preserving mass via orange links); isolated input pixels (non-orange/top/bottom) do not aggregate.

5. **Position (bbox) ↔ Hole presence in merged outputs**  
   - **Description**: Bbox positions of top blocks and orange connectors.  
   - **Interaction/Effect**: When top block bboxes overlap orange paths leading to bottom accents, outputs gain/create holes (1-13 total, often 1 per small element). Consistent across all trains: Merged output bboxes (e.g., [3,0,8,5] or [0,0,14,24]) inherit input bbox starts but expand via orange positions, introducing holes at intersection points (e.g., input hole=1 at [4,0,6,2] → output hole=1 at encompassing [3,0,8,5]; holeless inputs gain 1 hole post-merge). Bottom accent positions indirectly affect hole placement (e.g., center bottom → central output holes).  
   - **Consistency Note**: Every output element in a merged bbox has ≥1 hole if it covers an input hole or orange intersection; solid (hole=0) outputs only for non-merged bottom-influenced areas (e.g., train2 green). Unknown: precise hole count formula (adds inconsistently, e.g., 1 input hole → 1 or 2 output holes).

### Notes on Limitations
- **Unknown/Non-Consistent Elements**: Small mid-grid accents (e.g., yellow [4,4,4,5] p=2 in train2; blue [6,9,7,10] p=3 in train3) do not consistently interact—they appear in inputs but are absent or untraceable in outputs, suggesting irrelevance or non-propagating. Color gradients/marbles (mentioned in description) are not evident in data (all elements single-color). No consistent black element interaction (static, no bbox/pixel change). Test inputs follow similar structure but no outputs provided for verification.
- **No Forced Connections**: Only listed what is directly observable and repeats in every train (e.g., no semantic shape meanings like "L-shape rotation" as bbox/pixels don't support it consistently). Total transformation mechanism (e.g., why some merges horizontal vs. vertical) remains unknown.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
