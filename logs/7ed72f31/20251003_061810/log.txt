=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 06:18:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.

[2025-10-03 06:26:34] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 06:28:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual symmetry puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored cells (e.g., 1 or 8 as background, other numbers as objects, 2 as symmetry indicators). The goal is to detect connected groups of 2's as symmetry axes (single 2 for point symmetry, horizontal/vertical lines of 2's for reflection axes) and reflect non-background, non-2 objects across these axes to complete or mirror the grid, filling only background cells without overwriting existing non-background content or 2's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent cell value; all reflections should only target and overwrite background cells to avoid duplicating or corrupting existing objects.
 * 2's form connected components (4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right); treat them as symmetry triggers but do not reflect the 2's themselves—leave them in place in the output.
 * For single-cell 2 components: Apply 180-degree point symmetry (rotation or reflection through the center point) around the 2's position, mapping (i,j) to (2*r - i, 2*c - j).
 * For multi-cell 2 components: Only treat as valid axes if they form straight, consecutive horizontal (same row, contiguous columns) or vertical (same column, contiguous rows) lines; otherwise, ignore or handle differently (e.g., no symmetry applied in this attempt).
 * Reflections should propagate objects (colors != bg and !=2) across the axis but only if the target cell is background; do not create new 2's or alter existing objects.
 * Order of applying multiple symmetries matters—current attempt applies all independently on a copy of the input, which can cause over-reflection or conflicts if axes interact.
 * Subtlety: Components must be exactly consecutive without gaps (checked via max-min +1 == len(comp)); non-straight or gapped 2's (e.g., L-shapes) are ignored, which may miss cases.
 * Grid size is consistent (e.g., 18x18 in examples), but handle empty grids gracefully.
 * Easy to miss: Reflections can chain or overlap, but attempt doesn't prioritize or compose them; also, input 2's remain in output, which matches expectations.
 * Potential issue: Copying the full input grid first preserves all objects and 2's, but if symmetries reflect 2's indirectly, it could error (though attempt filters g[i][j] != bg and !=2).
 * Another subtlety: In horizontal/vertical symmetry, the axis row/column itself (where 2's are) should not be overwritten, and reflections are across the line (e.g., for horizontal at row rr, map i to 2*rr - i).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for filtering what to reflect and where to place.)

```python
def get_red_components(g: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int) -> List[List[tuple[int, int]]]:
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if g[i][j] == 2 and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and g[nx][ny] == 2 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder for 2's is helpful and correct for identifying connected groups; uses stack for efficiency.)

```python
def apply_point_symmetry(g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, bg: int, n: int, m: int) -> None:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if g[i][j] != bg and g[i][j] != 2:
                ir = 2 * r - i
                jr = 2 * c - j
                if 0 <= ir < n and 0 <= jr < m and output[ir][jr] == bg:
                    output[ir][jr] = g[i][j]
```
(This implements point symmetry correctly in logic but may over-apply if multiple centers; bounds-checked and bg-only overwrite is good.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_symmetry(g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], rr: int, bg: int, n: int, m: int) -> None:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if g[i][j] != bg and g[i][j] != 2:
                ir = 2 * rr - i
                jr = j
                if 0 <= ir < n and 0 <= jr < m and output[ir][jr] == bg:
                    output[ir][jr] = g[i][j]

def apply_vertical_symmetry(g: List[List[int]], output: List[List[int]], cc: int, bg: int, n: int, m: int) -> None:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if g[i][j] != bg and g[i][j] != 2:
                ir = i
                jr = 2 * cc - j
                if 0 <= ir < n and 0 <= jr < m and output[ir][jr] == bg:
                    output[ir][jr] = g[i][j]
```
(These implement line reflections correctly but apply to the entire grid; the axis position (rr or cc) is derived from component but assumes single row/col—works for lines but may need adjustment for multi-row/col axes.)

The main program function ties them together but has logic flaws in classifying components (e.g., assumes single row for horizontal but uses arbitrary rr).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly copies the input grid as a base (preserving original objects and 2's) and only overwrites bg cells, which matches expected behavior.
 * Successfully identifies bg and 2-components; point symmetry application is logically sound but leads to errors when combined with line symmetries.
 * For line components, correctly checks for consecutiveness (max-min +1 == len) and classifies as horizontal/vertical, but fails to apply them properly—e.g., in training 1, it introduces extraneous 8's, 4's, and 5's in positions like row 8 cols 0-1 (generated [8,8,...] vs expected [1,1,...]), row 16 col 0 (generated 4 vs expected 1), and row 17 cols 0-1,8 (generated 4's and misplaced 5 vs expected 1's), suggesting over-reflection or wrong axis position (perhaps treating non-line as line or wrong rr/cc).
 * In training 1, row 14 has extra 8's in cols 12-17 (generated all 8's vs expected mixed 8's and 1's at cols 13,16), indicating incomplete or excessive horizontal/vertical mirroring of bottom objects.
 * Training 2: Misplaces 3's in row 10 (generated leading 3 and trailing 3's vs expected starting/ending 8's), and introduces 4's in rows 16-17 (generated 4's in cols 5-7 vs expected all 8's), likely from wrongly applying vertical/horizontal symmetry to a non-consecutive or multi-type component, or reflecting bg-incorrectly.
 * Component classification works for simple cases but fails for complex 2 groups (e.g., if not purely h/v, ignored entirely, causing under-completion).
 * No handling for diagonal or non-straight 2 components, which may be present and need different symmetry (e.g., ignore or point-based).
 * Order of applying symmetries (point first, then lines) may cause conflicts, as reflections build on partially modified output.
 * get_red_components is essential and correct; symmetry apply functions are mostly helpful but not tuned for axis position in multi-cell lines (uses min/max but picks single rr/cc from set).
 * Overall, demonstrates core understanding of components and reflection math but incorrect in execution, leading to both training examples failing completely.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied symmetries but introduced inconsistencies, such as isolated 1's and 3's in positions that suggest partial reflections (e.g., row 4 cols 4-5 has 1's, row 8 col 3 has 2 but surrounding 8's, row 11-12 have 3's that look mirrored but incomplete, and row 7 col 3 has a lone 2 not handled as axis). Without the input grid, it's hard to verify exactly, but the scattered non-8 objects (1's in top-left, 4's in mid-right, 3's bottom) imply over- or under-reflection compared to expected full mirroring—e.g., the vertical 4's in cols 12-14 rows 2-6 look like a partial vertical line symmetry, but the 2 in row 7 col 3 isn't symmetrically placed, and bottom 3's in rows 11-15 seem chained but with gaps (e.g., row 13 has full row of 3's except edges, but row 16 has sparse 3's). This doesn't make sense as a complete symmetric grid; likely missing full propagation across all axes or wrong bg overwrite (8's dominate but some 1's persist incorrectly). To handle test, need better axis positioning for lines (e.g., center of the line, not arbitrary iter) and perhaps apply symmetries in input-order or iteratively until stable.

[2025-10-03 06:28:26] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 06:45:21] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where connected red elements (value 2) act as mirrors that reflect adjacent colored blobs (same non-background, non-2 values) symmetrically across them, filling background (bg) areas on the opposite side with the reflected color while preserving the mirrors and original colors. The reflections are handled differently based on the mirror type: point reflection (180-degree symmetry around a single cell), line reflection across vertical or horizontal segments, with only aligned portions of blobs being reflected to avoid over-extension beyond the mirror's span.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Red components (2's) are identified using 4-connected (orthogonal) adjacency, but only straight, gapless lines (vertical or horizontal) or single points are used as mirrors; irregular or diagonal shapes are ignored to avoid invalid reflections.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the color at grid[0][0] (often 8 in examples), and reflections only occur into bg cells—never overwriting existing colors, 2's, or other blobs.
 * Blobs of the same color touching the mirror are found using 8-connected adjacency (including diagonals) to capture irregular shapes, but reflections are conditional: for line mirrors, only blob cells whose row/col aligns with the mirror segment (between min/max extents) are reflected, preventing spillover beyond finite mirror lengths.
 * Touching cells are detected via 8-directional adjacency to the mirror (capturing diagonal touches), ensuring even corner-adjacent blobs can trigger reflections.
 * Point mirrors use central symmetry (nr = 2*pr - rr, nc = 2*pc - cc), which inverts positions around the point; line mirrors preserve the perpendicular coordinate (e.g., row unchanged for vertical mirrors) and flip across the line (e.g., nc = 2*k - cc).
 * Components must be consecutive without gaps (checked via max-min +1 == length and unique positions) to qualify as valid mirrors; duplicates or holes in lines invalidate them.
 * Reflections apply the entire blob's color to symmetric positions, but only if the target is bg; multiple mirrors process sequentially, potentially allowing chained reflections if one creates new touching blobs (though code processes all at once via changes dict).
 * Subtle: 8-connectivity for blobs allows "L-shapes" or diagonals to be treated as single units, but 4-connectivity for reds ensures only orthogonal mirror lines are recognized—diagonal reds would split into points or be ignored.
 * No self-reflection or overwriting mirrors/colors; changes are collected in a dict and applied after all processing to avoid mid-process interference.
 * Edge cases: isolated points as mirrors, mirrors at grid borders (reflections may go out-of-bounds and be ignored), blobs spanning multiple mirror segments, or bg-colored "blobs" (skipped since c != bg and !=2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Orthogonal only for reds

                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == 2 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```

```python
def classify_red_component(component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> str:
    # Classifies red components as 'point', 'vertical', 'horizontal', or 'ignore'; essential for determining reflection type and ensuring only straight, gapless mirrors are used.
    if len(component) == 1:
        return 'point'
    rows = [x for x, y in component]
    cols = [y for x, y in component]
    if len(set(cols)) == 1:  # All same column
        min_r, max_r = min(rows), max(rows)
        if max_r - min_r + 1 == len(rows) and len(set(rows)) == len(rows):  # Consecutive, no gaps/duplicates
            return 'vertical'
    if len(set(rows)) == 1:  # All same row
        min_c, max_c = min(cols), max(cols)
        if max_c - min_c + 1 == len(cols) and len(set(cols)) == len(cols):  # Consecutive, no gaps/duplicates
            return 'horizontal'
    return 'ignore'
```

```python
# The handle_point_mirror, handle_vertical_mirror, and handle_horizontal_mirror functions are helpful for targeted reflections:
# - Collect 8-adj touching cells, extract 8-connected blobs of same color.
# - Reflect only aligned portions (e.g., rows a-b for vertical) to symmetric positions if bg.
# - Use changes dict to batch updates.
# (Full implementations as in the attempt; they correctly implement symmetry formulas and boundary checks.)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, demonstrating understanding of mirror classification, blob extraction, and conditional reflections.
 * Successfully identifies and processes point, vertical, and horizontal mirrors while ignoring irregular reds.
 * Uses appropriate connectivity (4 for reds, 8 for blobs) and symmetry math, which worked for training.
 * Changes dict prevents overwriting during processing, a key consideration for multi-mirror grids.
 * No major misses in core logic, but potential subtlety: reflections only apply to blob cells aligned with mirror extent (e.g., row in [a,b] for vertical), which assumes finite mirrors don't reflect entire tall blobs— this may be correct but could over- or under-reflect if puzzle expects full-blob mirroring.
 * find_red_components and classify_red_component are essential and correct; they accurately extract and validate mirrors.
 * handle_*_mirror functions are helpful and not broken, but the 8-dir touching might capture unintended diagonal touches if puzzle intends only orthogonal adjacency (unknown if this caused issues).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant to reflection-based puzzles.
 * Training successes suggest core principles (symmetry, blob reflection into bg) are understood, but without input grids, can't confirm if subtle gap/consecutiveness checks were tested.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly correct and makes sense based on the code's logic: it preserves 2's (e.g., point at ~row 4 col 11, another at ~row 7 col 3, horizontal line at ~row 13 cols 7-12), background 8's dominate, and visible reflections include 4's in top-right (~rows 1-3 cols 12-14, possibly reflected from bottom 4's across a vertical mirror), 1's in mid-left (~rows 4-6 cols 4-6, extended from lower 1's), and 3's in bottom (~rows 10-17 with patterns matching potential horizontal/vertical reflections from scattered 3's).
 * Reflections look symmetric where expected: e.g., the 4's in row 5-7 cols 8-10 seem mirrored to top 4's, and bottom 3's (rows 11-17) have horizontal extensions that align with the row-13 2-line mirror; no overwrites of non-bg or 2's observed.
 * No obvious errors like reflections into non-bg, out-of-bounds artifacts, or ignored valid mirrors; blob shapes (e.g., the 3's in row 12 cols 7-12) appear to have partial reflections consistent with segment-limited rules.
 * One potential subtlety: the 1's in rows 8-10 left seem under-reflected (only partial column fill), which might indicate correct segment-limiting (if mirror is short) or a minor bug in alignment check; however, it aligns with code and doesn't look broken.
 * Overall, the test output demonstrates proper mirror processing without anomalies, suggesting the program handles the test input correctly.
