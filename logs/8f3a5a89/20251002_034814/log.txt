=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 03:48:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:01:45] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with values like 1 (solid/filled elements), 6 (special ground or base), 7 (resolved boundary or empty space), and 8 (unknowns to resolve). The goal is to process the input grid by selectively converting 8s to 7s based on border conditions, segment filling rules, and adjacency (dilation) to 1s, while respecting constraints like full vertical columns of 1s to avoid over-filling certain areas, likely simulating boundaries, shadows, or containment in a diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Border rules: Always fill leftmost column 8s to 7s. For rightmost column, fill 8s to 7s only if any non-bottom row has a 1 in the right column (has_right_1 condition). Top row: fill from left with 7s until the first 1 (inclusive? no, break before setting). Bottom row: fill from column 0 (or 1 if bottom-left is 6) with 7s until the first 1. If has_right_1, additionally fill top and bottom rows after the last 1 to the right end with 7s.
 * Segment filling subtleties: These are pre-dilation fills that establish initial boundaries. Bottom start skips column 0 if it's 6 to avoid overwriting. Fills stop strictly before a 1 (if g[i][j]==1, break without setting). Right extensions only apply if has_right_1, preventing premature right-border resolution.
 * Full vertical columns: Compute min_full as the leftmost column index where all rows are 1s (or n+1 if none). This acts as a "divider" or containment barrier—areas to the right of it may have different filling behavior.
 * Dilation rules: For each 8, check 8-directional adjacency to any 1 in the input g. If adjacent, set to 7 unless skipped: skip if min_full <=n and the adjacent 1's column q > min_full, or q==min_full and the current cell's j >=q. This prevents filling 8s in/near full columns from propagating incorrectly leftward or into contained areas. Order matters—dilation happens after border/segment fills, so it can override or extend them.
 * Subtle elements: 6 is preserved (e.g., bottom-left base) and doesn't trigger fills. 1s are never changed. Dilation uses input g for adjacency (not out), ensuring original solids drive resolution. If no full column (min_full=n+1), no skips—full dilation applies. Easy to miss: has_right_1 excludes bottom row for detection, but applies fills to all rows' right. In bottom row, if 6 present, j_start=1 avoids setting it to 7. Propagation doesn't chain (single-step dilation only).
 * General considerations: Grids vary in size; empty grid returns as-is. Outputs preserve 1s and 6s, resolve only 8s to 7s (no other values). Puzzle likely involves "growing" boundaries from 1s without crossing full vertical barriers or over-filling open right areas.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No custom classes or types in the attempt, but the min_full computation is helpful for identifying barriers
def compute_min_full(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    m, n = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    min_full = n + 1
    for j in range(n):
        is_full = all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(m))
        if is_full:
            min_full = min(min_full, j)
    return min_full
```

```python
# Directions for 8-way adjacency (helpful for dilation)
directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Helper to check has_right_1 (subtle: excludes bottom row)
def has_right_1_condition(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    m, n = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    return any(g[i][n - 1] == 1 for i in range(m - 1))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly handles basic left border filling (sets 8 to 7 in col 0 across all rows) in all examples.
 * Top row left segment fill works: stops before first 1 and sets to 7, matching expected in train 1 (7s up to col5 before 1 at col6).
 * Bottom row segment fill partially works: correctly starts at j=1 if bottom-left=6 and fills until first 1 (e.g., train 1 has 7s from col1-5), but fails to extend further in open areas (e.g., train 1 leaves 8s after the 1 at col12-15 as 8s, but expected fills them to 8s? Wait, expected has 8s there—no, expected bottom has 8s after col6's 1 up to end, but generated has 1s at end which shouldn't be—likely input 1s not overwritten, but code doesn't touch them; issue is not filling 8s to 7s post-1 in bottom).
 * has_right_1 detection works (true in train 1 and 3, enabling right fills), but right column fill is incomplete: sets rightmost 8s to 7 only if 8, but in train 1, right col is all 7? Expected right col has 8s in most rows—generated sets too many to 7 prematurely.
 * Right segment extensions (after last 1 in top/bottom) work in structure but over/under-apply: in train 1, top row generated has 7s to end after last1, but expected keeps 8s from col7 onward—code sets out[0][j]=7 for j>last1, but input has 1s at col10-11, so last1=11? Wait, code finds last1 as max j with g[0][j]==1, then fills after; but in train1 top: 7s to col5,1 at6,8s col7-9,1 at10,1 at11,7? col12-15—last1=11, fills col12-15 to7, but generated shows [7,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,1,1,7,7,7,7] yes, sets col12-15 to7, but expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]—so overfills col12-15 to7 instead of keeping 8s; subtle: perhaps right extensions shouldn't apply if not has_right_1 properly, but it is.
 * Dilation core works in train 2 (full correct), propagating 7s from 1-adjacent 8s, but fails in train1/3 due to skip logic: in train1, min_full likely none (n+1=16), so no skips, but generated leaves many 8s in middle-right as 8s (e.g., rows1-15 col7-15 mostly 8s, but expected fills more to8? No, expected has 8s there too, but differences in bottom: generated bottom has 1,1,1,1 at end but expected 8s—input probably has no 1s there, code didn't set them; wait, generated bottom [6,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1] vs expected [6,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]—generated incorrectly has 1s at col12-15, but that's likely input 1s, and code should have dilated adjacent 8s but not change 1s; issue is not filling the 8s between col6's1 and col12's1s to7? Dilation should catch them if adjacent.
 * In train3, dilation skip misapplies around min_full (likely col12 or so, full 1s?): generated row9 [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,1,7,8,...] vs expected [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,...]—generated inserts 7,7,1,7 around col10-13 instead of 8,8,1,8; similar in row10/11, where 7s appear left of 1s in expected 8 areas, suggesting skip logic blocks filling right of min_full incorrectly (e.g., q==min_full and j>=q skips too much, preventing boundary growth into contained regions). Row8 generated matches expected. Bottom row matches.
 * No object extraction function attempted; not relevant here (puzzle is grid-based resolution, not object detection). The dilation loop is helpful but broken in skip condition—it's overly restrictive, blocking valid fills near full columns (e.g., doesn't allow 8-to-7 if adjacent 1 is in/after min_full when j is nearby).
 * Border fills override out copy but dilation checks g, preventing feedback loops—good, but in train1, dilation doesn't fill bottom row's post-1 8s (col7-11,13-15?) because not adjacent to any 1? Col7-11 are 8s adjacent to col6's1 vertically? No, bottom row horizontal adjacency to col6=1 should set col7=7 if g[15][6]==1, but generated keeps 8—bug: dilation is for i,j in all, but perhaps order (row-major) misses if not revisited.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The right segment fill after last1 overfills open areas in train1 (sets to7 where expected 8s, like top col12-15). Bottom segment doesn't handle post-1 fills at all. No function for extracting segments or barriers beyond min_full—would help for complex shapes in train3.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense structurally (e.g., left borders filled to7, top/bottom segments to7 before 1s, dilation grows 7s around 1 clusters), but does not look fully correct—likely overfills or underfills due to same issues as train1/3. For example, row0 has 7s to col9 before1 at col10, then7 at col11—expected probably keeps col11 as8 if it's an open area post-1 without right extension. Row11 [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,1,1,1] has isolated8 at col7 and7 at col8 before1s, suggesting dilation skip or border logic incorrectly resolves near bottom 1s/6—expected might extend8s further left in bottom or fill the8 to7 consistently. Row4-6 have7s dipping into1 areas (e.g., row4 [7,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,1,7]—two7s before1 at col10, but if input has1s at col7-9? No, generated shows7s replacing likely8s, but pattern suggests incomplete propagation right of vertical1s. Bottom row [6,7,1,1,1,1,7,8,7,1,1,1] starts with6,7 then jumps to1s—likely underfills, missing7s between6 and first1s (if input has8s there), and has stray8 at col7 not dilated to7 adjacent to1s at col2-5/8-11. Overall, inconsistencies around1 clusters and potential min_full (maybe col10 full1s?) indicate skip logic blocks valid fills, similar to train3 mismatches—test needs better handling of contained regions right of barriers without over-resolving left extensions.

[2025-10-02 04:01:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 04:18:39] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an n x n grid of integers (primarily 1s, 8s, and others like 6 or 7 in outputs) to detect a "spine" (a full vertical column of 1s), then transforming the grid by cleaning extraneous 1s to 8s, drawing asymmetric frames or borders with 7s around the spine area, and filling other regions; if no spine exists, apply basic border and bottom-row conversions of 8s to 7s. The goal is to produce a visually structured output that highlights the spine as a central element with surrounding frames, while handling non-spine cases with minimal border fills.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * A spine is strictly a column k where every row has exactly 1 in that position; multiple spines are not handled (function returns the first found).
 * When a spine is present, all other 1s (not in column k) must be converted to 8s first, but the spine's 1s remain untouched.
 * Framing for spines is asymmetric and position-dependent: for spine at k, it involves setting specific borders to 7 (e.g., left border upper rows if 8→7, column k-1 all rows if 8→7, top row 0 to k-1 if 8→7, bottom row 1 to k-1 if 8→7), but this misses right-side framing, inner fills, or adjustments for k near edges (e.g., no k-1 if k=0).
 * Non-spine cases require only basic fills: left border upper rows (0 to n-2, col 0) 8→7, right border all rows (col n-1) 8→7, bottom row all cols 8→7; no other changes, preserving internal 1s or 8s.
 * Bottom row often ends with a special pattern like [6,7,7,...,7] or similar, suggesting a fixed "base" fill that isn't fully handled (e.g., leftmost bottom might be 6 regardless).
 * Subtleties include: frames don't always fill entire regions (e.g., expected outputs show partial 7s forming L-shapes or enclosures around left/non-spine areas); 8s act as "temporary" fillers that get selectively converted to 7s for borders/frames, but not all 8s are converted (internal 8s often remain); spine position affects frame extent (e.g., in train2, spine at col4-5 with 1s, but frame needs to enclose left side differently); in larger grids like train3, diagonal or stepped 1s near spine aren't cleaned properly, leading to stray 1s.
 * Easy-to-miss: bottom row in non-spine or framed cases has unique fills (e.g., train2 expected bottom [6,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7] preserves some 1s while filling others); right borders may need conditional 7s based on spine proximity; upper-left corners often get full 7 rows in no-spine but partial in spine cases.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided): preserve original 1s in spine and bottom specials; handle edge cases like spine at col0 (no left frame) or near end; no diagonal or horizontal "spine" detection—only vertical full columns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_full_spine(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    for k in range(n):
        if all(g[i][k] == 1 for i in range(n)):
            return True, k
    return False, -1
```
(This function correctly identifies the first full column of 1s as the spine; useful as-is for detection, but may need extension for multiple spines or validation.)

```python
def clean_other_1s(g: List[List[int]], k: int):
    n = len(g)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if j != k and g[i][j] == 1:
                g[i][j] = 8
```
(This cleans non-spine 1s to 8s effectively, but modifies in-place; copy grid first to avoid side effects. Helpful for isolating the spine.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely a simple spine or no-spine case with basic borders).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated kept too many 8s in internal areas (e.g., rows 0-2 cols1-3,8-9 are 8s but expected 7s or mixed; row3 cols0-3,5-9 8s vs expected 7s in frame positions; row4 col0=1 preserved but surrounding 8s not framed to 7s; row8 col6=1 stray vs expected col6=1 but framed around; bottom row has 8s in cols1-3,7-9 vs expected 7s). What worked: detected spine at cols4-5 (dual 1s?), cleaned some 1s, basic left/right/bottom 7s. What didn't: incomplete asymmetric frame (missed top/bottom extensions beyond k, right-side 7s, inner left fills to 7s); didn't preserve exact bottom 1 positions while filling.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated treated as partial spine (1s in col12 rows0-3,5-9? but not full, so fell to non-spine basic fill), resulting in upper rows with full 8s and stray 1s (e.g., rows0-2 all cols1-11,13-19=8 vs expected 7s in left frames like row0 all 7s except col12=1; row3 col0=1 but cols1-11,13-19=8 vs expected 7s in col0-3,11; lower rows like row14-18 have 8s in col14-19=1s but no frame, vs expected 7s in col13 and 1s framed). What worked: basic non-spine border fills (left upper, right all, bottom to 7s where 8). What didn't: no spine detected (col12 has gaps in rows4,10-13?), so no cleaning/frame; missed stepped 1s near bottom-right needing enclosure; upper-left over-filled with 8s instead of 7-frame.
 * Overall, program understands spine detection and basic cleaning/framing but misses: position-specific frame rules (e.g., enclose left of spine with 7s, partial bottom fills); handling dual/adjacent 1s as possible non-spines; bottom row specials (6 start, preserve select 1s); larger grids with irregular 1 patterns.
 * Function `draw_frame` is partially helpful but broken for non-edge spines (e.g., only handles left/k-1/top-left/bottom-inner, misses right/enclosure; in-place mod, assumes k>0).
 * Function `fill_non_spine_basic` is mostly correct for borders but incomplete (e.g., doesn't handle bottom specials like 6 or preserve internal 1s fully; misses upper-left full 7s in some expects).
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/region detection), but not needed—puzzle is column-based, not object-oriented; avoid adding unless for irregular 1 groups.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it appears to detect a spine at column 10 (0-indexed, all rows have 1 there), cleans other 1s to 8s, but applies incomplete framing—e.g., top row has all 7s left then 1,8 (col11=8 should be framed?), rows1-10 have left col0=7, then 8s to col9=7, then 1,8 (right col11=8 not converted to 7 for border; internal 8s remain unfilled vs likely expected partial 7 frames enclosing left area like in train2/3); bottom row starts with 6 then 7s to col10=1, col11=8 (8 should be 7 for right border). This mismatches patterns from training expects, where frames create enclosed 7 regions around spine/left (e.g., more 7s in top/bottom extensions, right 7s); stray 8 at end suggests missed right-border rule. To fix, extend framing to include right col (n-1) 8→7 always in spine cases, and fill inner regions left of k more aggressively to 7s based on original 1 positions.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an n x n grid of integers (primarily 1s, 8s, and others like 6 or 7 in outputs) to detect a "spine" (a full vertical column of 1s), then transforming the grid by cleaning extraneous 1s to 8s, drawing asymmetric frames or borders with 7s around the spine area, and filling other regions; if no spine exists, apply basic border and bottom-row conversions of 8s to 7s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with values like 1 (solid/filled elements), 6 (special ground or base), 7 (resolved boundary or empty space), and 8 (unknowns to resolve). The goal is to process the input grid by selectively converting 8s to 7s based on border conditions, segment filling rules, and adjacency (dilation) to 1s, while respecting constraints like full vertical columns of 1s to avoid over-filling certain areas, likely simulating boundaries, shadows, or containment in a diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Border rules: Always fill leftmost column 8s to 7s. For rightmost column, fill 8s to 7s only if any non-bottom row has a 1 in the right column (has_right_1 condition). Top row: fill from left with 7s until the first 1 (inclusive? no, break before setting). Bottom row: fill from column 0 (or 1 if bottom-left is 6) with 7s until the first 1. If has_right_1, additionally fill top and bottom rows after the last 1 to the right end with 7s.
 * Segment filling subtleties: These are pre-dilation fills that establish initial boundaries. Bottom start skips column 0 if it's 6 to avoid overwriting. Fills stop strictly before a 1 (if g[i][j]==1, break without setting). Right extensions only apply if has_right_1, preventing premature right-border resolution.
 * Full vertical columns: Compute min_full as the leftmost column index where all rows are 1s (or n+1 if none). This acts as a "divider" or containment barrier—areas to the right of it may have different filling behavior.
 * Dilation rules: For each 8, check 8-directional adjacency to any 1 in the input g. If adjacent, set to 7 unless skipped: skip if min_full <=n and the adjacent 1's column q > min_full, or q==min_full and the current cell's j >=q. This prevents filling 8s in/near full columns from propagating incorrectly leftward or into contained areas. Order matters—dilation happens after border/segment fills, so it can override or extend them.
 * Subtle elements: 6 is preserved (e.g., bottom-left base) and doesn't trigger fills. 1s are never changed. Dilation uses input g for adjacency (not out), ensuring original solids drive resolution. If no full column (min_full=n+1), no skips—full dilation applies. Easy to miss: has_right_1 excludes bottom row for detection, but applies fills to all rows' right. In bottom row, if 6 present, j_start=1 avoids setting it to 7. Propagation doesn't chain (single-step dilation only).
 * General considerations: Grids vary in size; empty grid returns as-is. Outputs preserve 1s and 6s, resolve only 8s to 7s (no other values). Puzzle likely involves "growing" boundaries from 1s without crossing full vertical barriers or over-filling open right areas.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No custom classes or types in the attempt, but the min_full computation is helpful for identifying barriers
def compute_min_full(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    m, n = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    min_full = n + 1
    for j in range(n):
        is_full = all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(m))
        if is_full:
            min_full = min(min_full, j)
    return min_full
```

```python
# Directions for 8-way adjacency (helpful for dilation)
directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Helper to check has_right_1 (subtle: excludes bottom row)
def has_right_1_condition(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    m, n = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    return any(g[i][n - 1] == 1 for i in range(m - 1))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly handles basic left border filling (sets 8 to 7 in col 0 across all rows) in all examples.
 * Top row left segment fill works: stops before first 1 and sets to 7, matching expected in train 1 (7s up to col5 before 1 at col6).
 * Bottom row segment fill partially works: correctly starts at j=1 if bottom-left=6 and fills until first 1 (e.g., train 1 has 7s from col1-5), but fails to extend further in open areas (e.g., train 1 leaves 8s after the 1 at col12-15 as 8s, but expected fills them to 8s? Wait, expected has 8s there—no, expected bottom has 8s after col6's 1 up to end, but generated has 1s at end which shouldn't be—likely input 1s not overwritten, but code doesn't touch them; issue is not filling 8s to 7s post-1 in bottom).
 * has_right_1 detection works (true in train 1 and 3, enabling right fills), but right column fill is incomplete: sets rightmost 8s to 7 only if 8, but in train 1, right col is all 7? Expected right col has 8s in most rows—generated sets too many to 7 prematurely.
 * Right segment extensions (after last 1 in top/bottom) work in structure but over/under-apply: in train 1, top row generated has 7s to end after last1, but expected keeps 8s from col7 onward—code sets out[0][j]=7 for j>last1, but input has 1s at col10-11, so last1=11? Wait, code finds last1 as max j with g[0][j]==1, then fills after; but in train1 top: 7s to col5,1 at6,8s col7-9,1 at10,1 at11,7? col12-15—last1=11, fills col12-15 to7, but generated shows [7,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,1,1,7,7,7,7] yes, sets col12-15 to7, but expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]—so overfills col12-15 to7 instead of keeping 8s; subtle: perhaps right extensions shouldn't apply if not has_right_1 properly, but it is.
 * Dilation core works in train 2 (full correct), propagating 7s from 1-adjacent 8s, but fails in train1/3 due to skip logic: in train1, min_full likely none (n+1=16), so no skips, but generated leaves many 8s in middle-right as 8s (e.g., rows1-15 col7-15 mostly 8s, but expected fills more to8? No, expected has 8s there too, but differences in bottom: generated bottom has 1,1,1,1 at end but expected 8s—input probably has no 1s there, code didn't set them; wait, generated bottom [6,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1] vs expected [6,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]—generated incorrectly has 1s at col12-15, but that's likely input 1s, and code should have dilated adjacent 8s but not change 1s; issue is not filling the 8s between col6's1 and col12's1s to7? Dilation should catch them if adjacent.
 * In train3, dilation skip misapplies around min_full (likely col12 or so, full 1s?): generated row9 [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,1,7,8,...] vs expected [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,...]—generated inserts 7,7,1,7 around col10-13 instead of 8,8,1,8; similar in row10/11, where 7s appear left of 1s in expected 8 areas, suggesting skip logic blocks filling right of min_full incorrectly (e.g., q==min_full and j>=q skips too much, preventing boundary growth into contained regions). Row8 generated matches expected. Bottom row matches.
 * No object extraction function attempted; not relevant here (puzzle is grid-based resolution, not object detection). The dilation loop is helpful but broken in skip condition—it's overly restrictive, blocking valid fills near full columns (e.g., doesn't allow 8-to-7 if adjacent 1 is in/after min_full when j is nearby).
 * Border fills override out copy but dilation checks g, preventing feedback loops—good, but in train1, dilation doesn't fill bottom row's post-1 8s (col7-11,13-15?) because not adjacent to any 1? Col7-11 are 8s adjacent to col6's1 vertically? No, bottom row horizontal adjacency to col6=1 should set col7=7 if g[15][6]==1, but generated keeps 8—bug: dilation is for i,j in all, but perhaps order (row-major) misses if not revisited.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The right segment fill after last1 overfills open areas in train1 (sets to7 where expected 8s, like top col12-15). Bottom segment doesn't handle post-1 fills at all. No function for extracting segments or barriers beyond min_full—would help for complex shapes in train3.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense structurally (e.g., left borders filled to7, top/bottom segments to7 before 1s, dilation grows 7s around 1 clusters), but does not look fully correct—likely overfills or underfills due to same issues as train1/3. For example, row0 has 7s to col9 before1 at col10, then7 at col11—expected probably keeps col11 as8 if it's an open area post-1 without right extension. Row11 [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,1,1,1] has isolated8 at col7 and7 at col8 before1s, suggesting dilation skip or border logic incorrectly resolves near bottom 1s/6—expected might extend8s further left in bottom or fill the8 to7 consistently. Row4-6 have7s dipping into1 areas (e.g., row4 [7,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,1,7]—two7s before1 at col10, but if input has1s at col7-9? No, generated shows7s replacing likely8s, but pattern suggests incomplete propagation right of vertical1s. Bottom row [6,7,1,1,1,1,7,8,7,1,1,1] starts with6,7 then jumps to1s—likely underfills, missing7s between6 and first1s (if input has8s there), and has stray8 at col7 not dilated to7 adjacent to1s at col2-5/8-11. Overall, inconsistencies around1 clusters and potential min_full (maybe col10 full1s?) indicate skip logic blocks valid fills, similar to train3 mismatches—test needs better handling of contained regions right of barriers without over-resolving left extensions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:31:06] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid puzzle where input grids containing 1s (likely representing key structural elements like filled cells or paths) and other numbers (e.g., 6 for bottom-left borders, possibly 0s or 8s as placeholders) are transformed into output grids by filling non-1 areas with 7s and 8s to create bordered or shaded regions. Rules involve detecting vertical "spines" (full columns of 1s), handling left/right asymmetries, border treatments (left always 7s, right conditional), and filling top/bottom rows based on 1 positions, with 8s often used for "open" or right-side extensions and 7s for "closed" or bordered fills.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * A "spine" is a full vertical column of 1s across all rows; if present at column k, it divides the grid into left (filled toward 7s) and right (often extended with 8s) regions, but non-spine 1s are adjusted to 7 (left of spine) or 8 (right of spine) without altering the spine itself.
 * Left border (column 0) is always filled with 7s where placeholders (e.g., 8) exist, except bottom-left which is 6; this applies universally.
 * Right border (last column) is set to 7 only if "do_right" is true (based on non-bottom rows having a 1 in the last column); otherwise, it remains 8 or extends the right-side fill—subtlety: even if do_right is false, right-side fills often need 8s for openness, not 7s.
 * Top row filling: Fill left of the first 1 with 7s; right of the last 1 should typically remain/extend 8s (not filled to 7), but only if do_right; easy to miss that post-1 fills on top/bottom should preserve 8s for right extensions unless bordered.
 * Bottom row filling: Similar to top, but starts from column 0 or 1 (if bottom-left is 6, skip column 0 for minj search); fill left of first 1 with 7s, right of last 1 with 8s (not 7s); bottom-left is always 6, and fills must account for g's bottom row structure.
 * Spine frame: If spine exists and k > 0, set the column immediately left of spine (k-1) to 7s where 8, creating a left border effect around the spine.
 * do_right flag: Triggered by any 1 in the last column of non-bottom rows; if true, right fills/borders lean toward 7s (closure), if false, toward 8s (open extension)—subtle in examples where right 1s are absent, leading to all-8 right sides.
 * Non-spine 1s: These are not preserved as 1s but converted based on position relative to spine (7 left, 8 right), suggesting 1s outside spine are "absorbed" into fills.
 * Placeholders: Input likely has 8s as fillable whitespaces; code copies g but overwrites 8s to 7s selectively—easy miss: not all 8s should become 7s; some must stay 8 for right/open areas.
 * Bottom-left 6: Always present in outputs, likely a fixed marker; filling starts after it if present.
 * No spine case: Falls back to original g rows for top/bottom 1 positions, but examples all seem to have spines.
 * Grid size n x n, assume square; empty grid returns empty.
 * Subtleties across attempts: Spine detection works but adjustment over-applies 7s to right borders; top/bottom right fills incorrectly set to 7s even when do_right=false; in complex examples (e.g., 2 and 3), non-spine 1s create irregular shapes that need precise left/right fills without overwriting structural 1s; bottom fill start logic fails when bottom row has early 6.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def has_full_spine(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return False, -1
    for col in range(n):
        if all(g[row][col] == 1 for row in range(n)):
            return True, col
    return False, -1
```
(This detects the spine column accurately, as seen in examples where column 6 or similar is the full-1 column; essential for dividing left/right logic.)

```python
def has_right_1(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return False
    m = len(g[0])
    return any(g[i][m - 1] == 1 for i in range(n - 1))
```
(Useful for do_right flag, but subtlety: it excludes bottom row, which matches examples where bottom-right 1s don't trigger closure.)

```python
def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Basic but necessary for non-destructive modifications; works well.)

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `apply_right_border`: Over-applies 7s to right border even when do_right=false should preserve 8s; not handling open right sides correctly (don't use as-is).
- `apply_top_fill` and `apply_bottom_fill`: Fill right of last 1 with 7s when it should be 8s in most cases; minj/maxj logic misses that right fills should extend 8s, not close with 7s (broken for right-side openness).
- `adjust_non_spine_positions`: Converts non-spine 1s correctly in direction but applies too broadly, leading to 7s bleeding into right areas; also doesn't preserve some 1s in expected outputs (e.g., example 2 has lingering 1s).
- `apply_spine_frame`: Sets left-of-spine to 7s, which works for borders but over-applies in non-border rows (partially helpful but needs scoping).
- `apply_left_border`: Works correctly for universal left 7s (keep using).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of fill rules.
 * Training example 1: Generated filled top row entirely with 7s (including right of the spine 1 at column 6), but expected 8s right of the 1; middle rows correctly identified spine and left-filled 8s with left-border 7s, but right border incorrectly 7 instead of 8, and no right extension to 8s; bottom row similar to top, 7s right of 1 instead of 8s—difference likely from apply_top_fill/apply_bottom_fill wrongly filling right with 7s even without do_right.
 * Training example 2: Generated mismatched shapes around non-spine 1s (e.g., row 1: [7,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,7] vs expected [7,8,8,7,1,1,7,8,7,7], where expected has more 7s interrupting 8s); row 3 has 8s where expected 7s; row 4 preserves 1s but fills wrong (generated [1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1] vs expected [1,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,1]); bottom row correct, but overall spine adjustment failed to handle clustered 1s (columns 4-5) as a unit, leading to over-8ing right side—unknown why some 1s stayed 1 in expected but code converted them.
 * Training example 3: Generated over-simplified left fills (e.g., row 1 all 8s left of spine vs expected mixed 7/8 borders); row 5 has full 8s after early 1s vs expected stepped 7s; bottom section (rows 14-19) correctly starts 1s but fills left with 8s vs expected 7s before 1s; spine at column 12 detected but adjust_non_spine_positions wrongly set some right 1s to 8 early—differences in irregular 1 clusters (e.g., diagonal-ish in top-left) not handled, leading to blob-like mismatches for unknown reasons (possibly needs object extraction for 1 groups).
 * Spine detection (has_full_spine) worked in all (e.g., column 6 in ex1, likely column 9 in ex2, column 12 in ex3), and left border 7s applied correctly.
 * do_right logic partially worked (e.g., no right 1s in ex1 led to some 8s, but still over-7ed borders).
 * copy_grid and left_border functions were accurate; spine_frame helped left-of-spine but not enough.
 * Overall misses: Right-side openness (8s extension post-1 in top/bottom and borders); handling of non-straight 1 groups (e.g., ex2/3 have horizontal/ stepped 1s needing custom fills); bottom fill start (skipping 6) worked but right fill failed; no object extraction for 1 clusters, leading to rigid column-based adjustments that ignore shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same pattern of errors as training example 1, with top row all 7s (including right of the 1 at column 10), middle rows having left 7s, internal 8s, spine 1s, but right border and post-1 areas as 7s instead of expected 8s for openness; bottom row starts with 6 and 7s, but likely should have 8s right of the 1 similar to ex1. This suggests no spine or do_right=false, but fills wrongly closed right side with 7s—without input grid, assuming a vertical spine at column 10 (all rows have 1 there), the output should mirror ex1 with 8s extending right on top/bottom and middle right border as 8; current output closes everything to 7s, missing the subtle right-extension rule. To handle test, update fills to preserve/force 8s right of last 1 unless do_right=true, and ensure right border stays 8 without spine interference.

[2025-10-02 04:31:06] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid puzzle where input grids containing 1s (likely representing key structural elements like filled cells or paths) and other numbers (e.g., 6 for bottom-left borders, possibly 0s or 8s as placeholders) are transformed into output grids by filling non-1 areas with 7s and 8s to create bordered or shaded regions. Rules involve detecting vertical "spines" (full columns of 1s), handling left/right asymmetries, border treatments (left always 7s, right conditional), and filling top/bottom rows based on 1 positions, with 8s often used for "open" or right-side extensions and 7s for "closed" or bordered fills.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * A "spine" is a full vertical column of 1s across all rows; if present at column k, it divides the grid into left (filled toward 7s) and right (often extended with 8s) regions, but non-spine 1s are adjusted to 7 (left of spine) or 8 (right of spine) without altering the spine itself.
 * Left border (column 0) is always filled with 7s where placeholders (e.g., 8) exist, except bottom-left which is 6; this applies universally.
 * Right border (last column) is set to 7 only if "do_right" is true (based on non-bottom rows having a 1 in the last column); otherwise, it remains 8 or extends the right-side fill—subtlety: even if do_right is false, right-side fills often need 8s for openness, not 7s.
 * Top row filling: Fill left of the first 1 with 7s; right of the last 1 should typically remain/extend 8s (not filled to 7), but only if do_right; easy to miss that post-1 fills on top/bottom should preserve 8s for right extensions unless bordered.
 * Bottom row filling: Similar to top, but starts from column 0 or 1 (if bottom-left is 6, skip column 0 for minj search); fill left of first 1 with 7s, right of last 1 with 8s (not 7s); bottom-left is always 6, and fills must account for g's bottom row structure.
 * Spine frame: If spine exists and k > 0, set the column immediately left of spine (k-1) to 7s where 8, creating a left border effect around the spine.
 * do_right flag: Triggered by any 1 in the last column of non-bottom rows; if true, right fills/borders lean toward 7s (closure), if false, toward 8s (open extension)—subtle in examples where right 1s are absent, leading to all-8 right sides.
 * Non-spine 1s: These are not preserved as 1s but converted based on position relative to spine (7 left, 8 right), suggesting 1s outside spine are "absorbed" into fills.
 * Placeholders: Input likely has 8s as fillable whitespaces; code copies g but overwrites 8s to 7s selectively—easy miss: not all 8s should become 7s; some must stay 8 for right/open areas.
 * Bottom-left 6: Always present in outputs, likely a fixed marker; filling starts after it if present.
 * No spine case: Falls back to original g rows for top/bottom 1 positions, but examples all seem to have spines.
 * Grid size n x n, assume square; empty grid returns empty.
 * Subtleties across attempts: Spine detection works but adjustment over-applies 7s to right borders; top/bottom right fills incorrectly set to 7s even when do_right=false; in complex examples (e.g., 2 and 3), non-spine 1s create irregular shapes that need precise left/right fills without overwriting structural 1s; bottom fill start logic fails when bottom row has early 6.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def has_full_spine(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return False, -1
    for col in range(n):
        if all(g[row][col] == 1 for row in range(n)):
            return True, col
    return False, -1
```
(This detects the spine column accurately, as seen in examples where column 6 or similar is the full-1 column; essential for dividing left/right logic.)

```python
def has_right_1(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return False
    m = len(g[0])
    return any(g[i][m - 1] == 1 for i in range(n - 1))
```
(Useful for do_right flag, but subtlety: it excludes bottom row, which matches examples where bottom-right 1s don't trigger closure.)

```python
def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Basic but necessary for non-destructive modifications; works well.)

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `apply_right_border`: Over-applies 7s to right border even when do_right=false should preserve 8s; not handling open right sides correctly (don't use as-is).
- `apply_top_fill` and `apply_bottom_fill`: Fill right of last 1 with 7s when it should be 8s in most cases; minj/maxj logic misses that right fills should extend 8s, not close with 7s (broken for right-side openness).
- `adjust_non_spine_positions`: Converts non-spine 1s correctly in direction but applies too broadly, leading to 7s bleeding into right areas; also doesn't preserve some 1s in expected outputs (e.g., example 2 has lingering 1s).
- `apply_spine_frame`: Sets left-of-spine to 7s, which works for borders but over-applies in non-border rows (partially helpful but needs scoping).
- `apply_left_border`: Works correctly for universal left 7s (keep using).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of fill rules.
 * Training example 1: Generated filled top row entirely with 7s (including right of the spine 1 at column 6), but expected 8s right of the 1; middle rows correctly identified spine and left-filled 8s with left-border 7s, but right border incorrectly 7 instead of 8, and no right extension to 8s; bottom row similar to top, 7s right of 1 instead of 8s—difference likely from apply_top_fill/apply_bottom_fill wrongly filling right with 7s even without do_right.
 * Training example 2: Generated mismatched shapes around non-spine 1s (e.g., row 1: [7,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,7] vs expected [7,8,8,7,1,1,7,8,7,7], where expected has more 7s interrupting 8s); row 3 has 8s where expected 7s; row 4 preserves 1s but fills wrong (generated [1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1] vs expected [1,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,1]); bottom row correct, but overall spine adjustment failed to handle clustered 1s (columns 4-5) as a unit, leading to over-8ing right side—unknown why some 1s stayed 1 in expected but code converted them.
 * Training example 3: Generated over-simplified left fills (e.g., row 1 all 8s left of spine vs expected mixed 7/8 borders); row 5 has full 8s after early 1s vs expected stepped 7s; bottom section (rows 14-19) correctly starts 1s but fills left with 8s vs expected 7s before 1s; spine at column 12 detected but adjust_non_spine_positions wrongly set some right 1s to 8 early—differences in irregular 1 clusters (e.g., diagonal-ish in top-left) not handled, leading to blob-like mismatches for unknown reasons (possibly needs object extraction for 1 groups).
 * Spine detection (has_full_spine) worked in all (e.g., column 6 in ex1, likely column 9 in ex2, column 12 in ex3), and left border 7s applied correctly.
 * do_right logic partially worked (e.g., no right 1s in ex1 led to some 8s, but still over-7ed borders).
 * copy_grid and left_border functions were accurate; spine_frame helped left-of-spine but not enough.
 * Overall misses: Right-side openness (8s extension post-1 in top/bottom and borders); handling of non-straight 1 groups (e.g., ex2/3 have horizontal/ stepped 1s needing custom fills); bottom fill start (skipping 6) worked but right fill failed; no object extraction for 1 clusters, leading to rigid column-based adjustments that ignore shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same pattern of errors as training example 1, with top row all 7s (including right of the 1 at column 10), middle rows having left 7s, internal 8s, spine 1s, but right border and post-1 areas as 7s instead of expected 8s for openness; bottom row starts with 6 and 7s, but likely should have 8s right of the 1 similar to ex1. This suggests no spine or do_right=false, but fills wrongly closed right side with 7s—without input grid, assuming a vertical spine at column 10 (all rows have 1 there), the output should mirror ex1 with 8s extending right on top/bottom and middle right border as 8; current output closes everything to 7s, missing the subtle right-extension rule. To handle test, update fills to preserve/force 8s right of last 1 unless do_right=true, and ensure right border stays 8 without spine interference.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an n x n grid of integers (primarily 1s, 8s, and others like 6 or 7 in outputs) to detect a "spine" (a full vertical column of 1s), then transforming the grid by cleaning extraneous 1s to 8s, drawing asymmetric frames or borders with 7s around the spine area, and filling other regions; if no spine exists, apply basic border and bottom-row conversions of 8s to 7s. The goal is to produce a visually structured output that highlights the spine as a central element with surrounding frames, while handling non-spine cases with minimal border fills.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * A spine is strictly a column k where every row has exactly 1 in that position; multiple spines are not handled (function returns the first found).
 * When a spine is present, all other 1s (not in column k) must be converted to 8s first, but the spine's 1s remain untouched.
 * Framing for spines is asymmetric and position-dependent: for spine at k, it involves setting specific borders to 7 (e.g., left border upper rows if 8→7, column k-1 all rows if 8→7, top row 0 to k-1 if 8→7, bottom row 1 to k-1 if 8→7), but this misses right-side framing, inner fills, or adjustments for k near edges (e.g., no k-1 if k=0).
 * Non-spine cases require only basic fills: left border upper rows (0 to n-2, col 0) 8→7, right border all rows (col n-1) 8→7, bottom row all cols 8→7; no other changes, preserving internal 1s or 8s.
 * Bottom row often ends with a special pattern like [6,7,7,...,7] or similar, suggesting a fixed "base" fill that isn't fully handled (e.g., leftmost bottom might be 6 regardless).
 * Subtleties include: frames don't always fill entire regions (e.g., expected outputs show partial 7s forming L-shapes or enclosures around left/non-spine areas); 8s act as "temporary" fillers that get selectively converted to 7s for borders/frames, but not all 8s are converted (internal 8s often remain); spine position affects frame extent (e.g., in train2, spine at col4-5 with 1s, but frame needs to enclose left side differently); in larger grids like train3, diagonal or stepped 1s near spine aren't cleaned properly, leading to stray 1s.
 * Easy-to-miss: bottom row in non-spine or framed cases has unique fills (e.g., train2 expected bottom [6,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7] preserves some 1s while filling others); right borders may need conditional 7s based on spine proximity; upper-left corners often get full 7 rows in no-spine but partial in spine cases.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided): preserve original 1s in spine and bottom specials; handle edge cases like spine at col0 (no left frame) or near end; no diagonal or horizontal "spine" detection—only vertical full columns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_full_spine(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    for k in range(n):
        if all(g[i][k] == 1 for i in range(n)):
            return True, k
    return False, -1
```
(This function correctly identifies the first full column of 1s as the spine; useful as-is for detection, but may need extension for multiple spines or validation.)

```python
def clean_other_1s(g: List[List[int]], k: int):
    n = len(g)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if j != k and g[i][j] == 1:
                g[i][j] = 8
```
(This cleans non-spine 1s to 8s effectively, but modifies in-place; copy grid first to avoid side effects. Helpful for isolating the spine.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely a simple spine or no-spine case with basic borders).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated kept too many 8s in internal areas (e.g., rows 0-2 cols1-3,8-9 are 8s but expected 7s or mixed; row3 cols0-3,5-9 8s vs expected 7s in frame positions; row4 col0=1 preserved but surrounding 8s not framed to 7s; row8 col6=1 stray vs expected col6=1 but framed around; bottom row has 8s in cols1-3,7-9 vs expected 7s). What worked: detected spine at cols4-5 (dual 1s?), cleaned some 1s, basic left/right/bottom 7s. What didn't: incomplete asymmetric frame (missed top/bottom extensions beyond k, right-side 7s, inner left fills to 7s); didn't preserve exact bottom 1 positions while filling.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated treated as partial spine (1s in col12 rows0-3,5-9? but not full, so fell to non-spine basic fill), resulting in upper rows with full 8s and stray 1s (e.g., rows0-2 all cols1-11,13-19=8 vs expected 7s in left frames like row0 all 7s except col12=1; row3 col0=1 but cols1-11,13-19=8 vs expected 7s in col0-3,11; lower rows like row14-18 have 8s in col14-19=1s but no frame, vs expected 7s in col13 and 1s framed). What worked: basic non-spine border fills (left upper, right all, bottom to 7s where 8). What didn't: no spine detected (col12 has gaps in rows4,10-13?), so no cleaning/frame; missed stepped 1s near bottom-right needing enclosure; upper-left over-filled with 8s instead of 7-frame.
 * Overall, program understands spine detection and basic cleaning/framing but misses: position-specific frame rules (e.g., enclose left of spine with 7s, partial bottom fills); handling dual/adjacent 1s as possible non-spines; bottom row specials (6 start, preserve select 1s); larger grids with irregular 1 patterns.
 * Function `draw_frame` is partially helpful but broken for non-edge spines (e.g., only handles left/k-1/top-left/bottom-inner, misses right/enclosure; in-place mod, assumes k>0).
 * Function `fill_non_spine_basic` is mostly correct for borders but incomplete (e.g., doesn't handle bottom specials like 6 or preserve internal 1s fully; misses upper-left full 7s in some expects).
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/region detection), but not needed—puzzle is column-based, not object-oriented; avoid adding unless for irregular 1 groups.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it appears to detect a spine at column 10 (0-indexed, all rows have 1 there), cleans other 1s to 8s, but applies incomplete framing—e.g., top row has all 7s left then 1,8 (col11=8 should be framed?), rows1-10 have left col0=7, then 8s to col9=7, then 1,8 (right col11=8 not converted to 7 for border; internal 8s remain unfilled vs likely expected partial 7 frames enclosing left area like in train2/3); bottom row starts with 6 then 7s to col10=1, col11=8 (8 should be 7 for right border). This mismatches patterns from training expects, where frames create enclosed 7 regions around spine/left (e.g., more 7s in top/bottom extensions, right 7s); stray 8 at end suggests missed right-border rule. To fix, extend framing to include right col (n-1) 8→7 always in spine cases, and fill inner regions left of k more aggressively to 7s based on original 1 positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with values like 1 (solid/filled elements), 6 (special ground or base), 7 (resolved boundary or empty space), and 8 (unknowns to resolve). The goal is to process the input grid by selectively converting 8s to 7s based on border conditions, segment filling rules, and adjacency (dilation) to 1s, while respecting constraints like full vertical columns of 1s to avoid over-filling certain areas, likely simulating boundaries, shadows, or containment in a diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Border rules: Always fill leftmost column 8s to 7s. For rightmost column, fill 8s to 7s only if any non-bottom row has a 1 in the right column (has_right_1 condition). Top row: fill from left with 7s until the first 1 (inclusive? no, break before setting). Bottom row: fill from column 0 (or 1 if bottom-left is 6) with 7s until the first 1. If has_right_1, additionally fill top and bottom rows after the last 1 to the right end with 7s.
 * Segment filling subtleties: These are pre-dilation fills that establish initial boundaries. Bottom start skips column 0 if it's 6 to avoid overwriting. Fills stop strictly before a 1 (if g[i][j]==1, break without setting). Right extensions only apply if has_right_1, preventing premature right-border resolution.
 * Full vertical columns: Compute min_full as the leftmost column index where all rows are 1s (or n+1 if none). This acts as a "divider" or containment barrier—areas to the right of it may have different filling behavior.
 * Dilation rules: For each 8, check 8-directional adjacency to any 1 in the input g. If adjacent, set to 7 unless skipped: skip if min_full <=n and the adjacent 1's column q > min_full, or q==min_full and the current cell's j >=q. This prevents filling 8s in/near full columns from propagating incorrectly leftward or into contained areas. Order matters—dilation happens after border/segment fills, so it can override or extend them.
 * Subtle elements: 6 is preserved (e.g., bottom-left base) and doesn't trigger fills. 1s are never changed. Dilation uses input g for adjacency (not out), ensuring original solids drive resolution. If no full column (min_full=n+1), no skips—full dilation applies. Easy to miss: has_right_1 excludes bottom row for detection, but applies fills to all rows' right. In bottom row, if 6 present, j_start=1 avoids setting it to 7. Propagation doesn't chain (single-step dilation only).
 * General considerations: Grids vary in size; empty grid returns as-is. Outputs preserve 1s and 6s, resolve only 8s to 7s (no other values). Puzzle likely involves "growing" boundaries from 1s without crossing full vertical barriers or over-filling open right areas.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No custom classes or types in the attempt, but the min_full computation is helpful for identifying barriers
def compute_min_full(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    m, n = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    min_full = n + 1
    for j in range(n):
        is_full = all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(m))
        if is_full:
            min_full = min(min_full, j)
    return min_full
```

```python
# Directions for 8-way adjacency (helpful for dilation)
directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Helper to check has_right_1 (subtle: excludes bottom row)
def has_right_1_condition(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    m, n = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    return any(g[i][n - 1] == 1 for i in range(m - 1))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly handles basic left border filling (sets 8 to 7 in col 0 across all rows) in all examples.
 * Top row left segment fill works: stops before first 1 and sets to 7, matching expected in train 1 (7s up to col5 before 1 at col6).
 * Bottom row segment fill partially works: correctly starts at j=1 if bottom-left=6 and fills until first 1 (e.g., train 1 has 7s from col1-5), but fails to extend further in open areas (e.g., train 1 leaves 8s after the 1 at col12-15 as 8s, but expected fills them to 8s? Wait, expected has 8s there—no, expected bottom has 8s after col6's 1 up to end, but generated has 1s at end which shouldn't be—likely input 1s not overwritten, but code doesn't touch them; issue is not filling 8s to 7s post-1 in bottom).
 * has_right_1 detection works (true in train 1 and 3, enabling right fills), but right column fill is incomplete: sets rightmost 8s to 7 only if 8, but in train 1, right col is all 7? Expected right col has 8s in most rows—generated sets too many to 7 prematurely.
 * Right segment extensions (after last 1 in top/bottom) work in structure but over/under-apply: in train 1, top row generated has 7s to end after last1, but expected keeps 8s from col7 onward—code sets out[0][j]=7 for j>last1, but input has 1s at col10-11, so last1=11? Wait, code finds last1 as max j with g[0][j]==1, then fills after; but in train1 top: 7s to col5,1 at6,8s col7-9,1 at10,1 at11,7? col12-15—last1=11, fills col12-15 to7, but generated shows [7,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,1,1,7,7,7,7] yes, sets col12-15 to7, but expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]—so overfills col12-15 to7 instead of keeping 8s; subtle: perhaps right extensions shouldn't apply if not has_right_1 properly, but it is.
 * Dilation core works in train 2 (full correct), propagating 7s from 1-adjacent 8s, but fails in train1/3 due to skip logic: in train1, min_full likely none (n+1=16), so no skips, but generated leaves many 8s in middle-right as 8s (e.g., rows1-15 col7-15 mostly 8s, but expected fills more to8? No, expected has 8s there too, but differences in bottom: generated bottom has 1,1,1,1 at end but expected 8s—input probably has no 1s there, code didn't set them; wait, generated bottom [6,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1] vs expected [6,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]—generated incorrectly has 1s at col12-15, but that's likely input 1s, and code should have dilated adjacent 8s but not change 1s; issue is not filling the 8s between col6's1 and col12's1s to7? Dilation should catch them if adjacent.
 * In train3, dilation skip misapplies around min_full (likely col12 or so, full 1s?): generated row9 [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,1,7,8,...] vs expected [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,...]—generated inserts 7,7,1,7 around col10-13 instead of 8,8,1,8; similar in row10/11, where 7s appear left of 1s in expected 8 areas, suggesting skip logic blocks filling right of min_full incorrectly (e.g., q==min_full and j>=q skips too much, preventing boundary growth into contained regions). Row8 generated matches expected. Bottom row matches.
 * No object extraction function attempted; not relevant here (puzzle is grid-based resolution, not object detection). The dilation loop is helpful but broken in skip condition—it's overly restrictive, blocking valid fills near full columns (e.g., doesn't allow 8-to-7 if adjacent 1 is in/after min_full when j is nearby).
 * Border fills override out copy but dilation checks g, preventing feedback loops—good, but in train1, dilation doesn't fill bottom row's post-1 8s (col7-11,13-15?) because not adjacent to any 1? Col7-11 are 8s adjacent to col6's1 vertically? No, bottom row horizontal adjacency to col6=1 should set col7=7 if g[15][6]==1, but generated keeps 8—bug: dilation is for i,j in all, but perhaps order (row-major) misses if not revisited.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The right segment fill after last1 overfills open areas in train1 (sets to7 where expected 8s, like top col12-15). Bottom segment doesn't handle post-1 fills at all. No function for extracting segments or barriers beyond min_full—would help for complex shapes in train3.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense structurally (e.g., left borders filled to7, top/bottom segments to7 before 1s, dilation grows 7s around 1 clusters), but does not look fully correct—likely overfills or underfills due to same issues as train1/3. For example, row0 has 7s to col9 before1 at col10, then7 at col11—expected probably keeps col11 as8 if it's an open area post-1 without right extension. Row11 [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,1,1,1] has isolated8 at col7 and7 at col8 before1s, suggesting dilation skip or border logic incorrectly resolves near bottom 1s/6—expected might extend8s further left in bottom or fill the8 to7 consistently. Row4-6 have7s dipping into1 areas (e.g., row4 [7,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,1,7]—two7s before1 at col10, but if input has1s at col7-9? No, generated shows7s replacing likely8s, but pattern suggests incomplete propagation right of vertical1s. Bottom row [6,7,1,1,1,1,7,8,7,1,1,1] starts with6,7 then jumps to1s—likely underfills, missing7s between6 and first1s (if input has8s there), and has stray8 at col7 not dilated to7 adjacent to1s at col2-5/8-11. Overall, inconsistencies around1 clusters and potential min_full (maybe col10 full1s?) indicate skip logic blocks valid fills, similar to train3 mismatches—test needs better handling of contained regions right of barriers without over-resolving left extensions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:39:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing a floor plan, maze, or architectural diagram with 1s as walls or lines) where the goal is to process the input grid and output a modified version that highlights boundaries, fills certain areas, and distinguishes core structures like "spines" (full vertical columns of 1s) using numbers like 6, 7, and 8 to indicate different types of wall segments or invalid placements. The processing prioritizes border treatments, connected components of 1s, and conditional filling based on the presence of a spine, aiming to "clean" or classify non-essential 1s while preserving structural integrity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * A "spine" is a full column (from top to bottom) entirely filled with 1s; if present, non-spine 1s are marked as 8 (temporary invalid), then specific left-side and border positions are downgraded to 7 (valid boundary), with top and bottom rows filled leftward only up to the first 1.
 * Without a spine, handle borders more symmetrically: left border always gets 7s for 8s, right border gets 7s only if there's a 1 on the right edge (excluding bottom row), and top/bottom rows fill left of first 1 and right of last 1 with 7s; additionally, apply "dilation" to inner 8s adjacent to valid border-touching 1-components, setting them to 7.
 * Subtle border handling: Bottom-left cell can be pre-marked as 6 in input (possibly a special floor or entry point), which affects fill starting points (e.g., skip col 0 if it's 6); left-of-spine cells get 7s regardless of connectivity.
 * Connected components of 1s: Only those touching any border are "valid" and can influence dilation (turning adjacent inner 8s to 7s); use 4-directional connectivity for components, but 8-directional for dilation checks.
 * Edge cases: Grids <=2x2 skip dilation; no full right-border 1s means right side stays 8-heavy; top/bottom fills are asymmetric (left-only in spine case, bidirectional in no-spine); preserve original 1s in spines or valid positions.
 * Potential misses: Over-filling right side in no-spine cases if right border isn't fully checked; dilation only applies to middle rows (1 to n-2) and only if adjacent to valid_ones; visited tracking prevents recounting in components.
 * Input may have pre-existing 6s or 7s (e.g., bottom-left 6), which aren't overwritten unless specified; output should not alter original 1s unless they're non-spine.

```

(Note: Functions like get_minj_after and get_maxj are helpful for row fills but are simple scans; no types beyond List[List[int]] are used, but Tuple[int,int] for positions is useful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it successfully handled all three training examples (1,2,3 marked CORRECT), demonstrating solid understanding of spine detection, border filling, and basic no-spine logic.
 * What worked: Accurate spine identification and left-side prioritization in spine cases (e.g., setting left border and left-of-spine to 7, leftward top/bottom fills); no-spine border symmetry and dilation correctly applied in training cases, preserving 1s and using 8 as temp invalid marker.
 * What didn't work: In potential edge cases (inferred from code), bottom row fill start skips col 0 only if it's already 6 (pre-input special), but code checks out[i_bot][0] post-left-border set (which turns 8 to 7), so it may always start at 0 unless input has 6—could mismatch if input 6s are overwritten incorrectly; right border in spine case is never set to 7 (stays 8), which worked for training but may over-mark right side as invalid.
 * Dilation is only in no-spine branch and skips borders/middles appropriately, but uses out for checks (post-8 marking) while valid_ones uses original g—consistent but subtle if input has non-1s affecting components.
 * No prior attempts shown, but code includes untested elements like has_right = any(g[i][n-1]==1 for i in range(n-1)) (excludes bottom row, subtle exclusion); get_valid_ones is essential and correct for connectivity, but could be extended to 8-dir if puzzle needs diagonal touches (not currently).
 * Overall, core logic passed training, but subtle input assumptions (e.g., pre-existing 6s) and asymmetric right handling in spine cases may need tweaks for broader cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x12 grid with a clear spine at column 10 (all rows have 1 there), left column all 7s except bottom 6, top/bottom rows filled leftward with 7s up to col 9, middle rows have left 7 then 8s turning to 7 at col 9 before the 1 and final 8 at col 11—consistent with spine-case logic (no right filling, no dilation since spine branch skips it).
 * It makes sense per the code: Non-spine 1s marked 8, left border/left-of-spine (col 9) set to 7, top/bottom left fills to 7, bottom-left preserved as 6 (implies input had 6 there, not overwritten), right column stays 8 (no has_right check in spine case, correctly per code).
 * However, it may not be fully correct if the puzzle expects dilation or right-border treatment even in spine cases (e.g., inner 8s in middle rows stay 8 except col 9, but if test input has border-touching components on right, they aren't influencing anything); the all-8 middle-right looks under-filled compared to potential expectations for symmetric boundary highlighting—different from what might be expected if no-spine logic (with dilation) should bleed into spine cases for connected 1s.
 * Rightmost column all 8s suggests no right-border 7s, which matches code but could be wrong if test input has right-edge 1s warranting 7s (unknown without input grid, but output asymmetry hints at over-reliance on spine left-bias).
 * Bottom row starts fill at col 1 (due to 6 at [11][0]), filling 7s to col 9, which is correct per code but subtly different if puzzle wants full left fill including over 6.

[2025-10-02 04:39:34] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid puzzle where input grids containing 1s (likely representing key structural elements like filled cells or paths) and other numbers (e.g., 6 for bottom-left borders, possibly 0s or 8s as placeholders) are transformed into output grids by filling non-1 areas with 7s and 8s to create bordered or shaded regions. Rules involve detecting vertical "spines" (full columns of 1s), handling left/right asymmetries, border treatments (left always 7s, right conditional), and filling top/bottom rows based on 1 positions, with 8s often used for "open" or right-side extensions and 7s for "closed" or bordered fills.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * A "spine" is a full vertical column of 1s across all rows; if present at column k, it divides the grid into left (filled toward 7s) and right (often extended with 8s) regions, but non-spine 1s are adjusted to 7 (left of spine) or 8 (right of spine) without altering the spine itself.
 * Left border (column 0) is always filled with 7s where placeholders (e.g., 8) exist, except bottom-left which is 6; this applies universally.
 * Right border (last column) is set to 7 only if "do_right" is true (based on non-bottom rows having a 1 in the last column); otherwise, it remains 8 or extends the right-side fill—subtlety: even if do_right is false, right-side fills often need 8s for openness, not 7s.
 * Top row filling: Fill left of the first 1 with 7s; right of the last 1 should typically remain/extend 8s (not filled to 7), but only if do_right; easy to miss that post-1 fills on top/bottom should preserve 8s for right extensions unless bordered.
 * Bottom row filling: Similar to top, but starts from column 0 or 1 (if bottom-left is 6, skip column 0 for minj search); fill left of first 1 with 7s, right of last 1 with 8s (not 7s); bottom-left is always 6, and fills must account for g's bottom row structure.
 * Spine frame: If spine exists and k > 0, set the column immediately left of spine (k-1) to 7s where 8, creating a left border effect around the spine.
 * do_right flag: Triggered by any 1 in the last column of non-bottom rows; if true, right fills/borders lean toward 7s (closure), if false, toward 8s (open extension)—subtle in examples where right 1s are absent, leading to all-8 right sides.
 * Non-spine 1s: These are not preserved as 1s but converted based on position relative to spine (7 left, 8 right), suggesting 1s outside spine are "absorbed" into fills.
 * Placeholders: Input likely has 8s as fillable whitespaces; code copies g but overwrites 8s to 7s selectively—easy miss: not all 8s should become 7s; some must stay 8 for right/open areas.
 * Bottom-left 6: Always present in outputs, likely a fixed marker; filling starts after it if present.
 * No spine case: Falls back to original g rows for top/bottom 1 positions, but examples all seem to have spines.
 * Grid size n x n, assume square; empty grid returns empty.
 * Subtleties across attempts: Spine detection works but adjustment over-applies 7s to right borders; top/bottom right fills incorrectly set to 7s even when do_right=false; in complex examples (e.g., 2 and 3), non-spine 1s create irregular shapes that need precise left/right fills without overwriting structural 1s; bottom fill start logic fails when bottom row has early 6.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def has_full_spine(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return False, -1
    for col in range(n):
        if all(g[row][col] == 1 for row in range(n)):
            return True, col
    return False, -1
```
(This detects the spine column accurately, as seen in examples where column 6 or similar is the full-1 column; essential for dividing left/right logic.)

```python
def has_right_1(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return False
    m = len(g[0])
    return any(g[i][m - 1] == 1 for i in range(n - 1))
```
(Useful for do_right flag, but subtlety: it excludes bottom row, which matches examples where bottom-right 1s don't trigger closure.)

```python
def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Basic but necessary for non-destructive modifications; works well.)

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `apply_right_border`: Over-applies 7s to right border even when do_right=false should preserve 8s; not handling open right sides correctly (don't use as-is).
- `apply_top_fill` and `apply_bottom_fill`: Fill right of last 1 with 7s when it should be 8s in most cases; minj/maxj logic misses that right fills should extend 8s, not close with 7s (broken for right-side openness).
- `adjust_non_spine_positions`: Converts non-spine 1s correctly in direction but applies too broadly, leading to 7s bleeding into right areas; also doesn't preserve some 1s in expected outputs (e.g., example 2 has lingering 1s).
- `apply_spine_frame`: Sets left-of-spine to 7s, which works for borders but over-applies in non-border rows (partially helpful but needs scoping).
- `apply_left_border`: Works correctly for universal left 7s (keep using).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of fill rules.
 * Training example 1: Generated filled top row entirely with 7s (including right of the spine 1 at column 6), but expected 8s right of the 1; middle rows correctly identified spine and left-filled 8s with left-border 7s, but right border incorrectly 7 instead of 8, and no right extension to 8s; bottom row similar to top, 7s right of 1 instead of 8s—difference likely from apply_top_fill/apply_bottom_fill wrongly filling right with 7s even without do_right.
 * Training example 2: Generated mismatched shapes around non-spine 1s (e.g., row 1: [7,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,7] vs expected [7,8,8,7,1,1,7,8,7,7], where expected has more 7s interrupting 8s); row 3 has 8s where expected 7s; row 4 preserves 1s but fills wrong (generated [1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1] vs expected [1,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,1]); bottom row correct, but overall spine adjustment failed to handle clustered 1s (columns 4-5) as a unit, leading to over-8ing right side—unknown why some 1s stayed 1 in expected but code converted them.
 * Training example 3: Generated over-simplified left fills (e.g., row 1 all 8s left of spine vs expected mixed 7/8 borders); row 5 has full 8s after early 1s vs expected stepped 7s; bottom section (rows 14-19) correctly starts 1s but fills left with 8s vs expected 7s before 1s; spine at column 12 detected but adjust_non_spine_positions wrongly set some right 1s to 8 early—differences in irregular 1 clusters (e.g., diagonal-ish in top-left) not handled, leading to blob-like mismatches for unknown reasons (possibly needs object extraction for 1 groups).
 * Spine detection (has_full_spine) worked in all (e.g., column 6 in ex1, likely column 9 in ex2, column 12 in ex3), and left border 7s applied correctly.
 * do_right logic partially worked (e.g., no right 1s in ex1 led to some 8s, but still over-7ed borders).
 * copy_grid and left_border functions were accurate; spine_frame helped left-of-spine but not enough.
 * Overall misses: Right-side openness (8s extension post-1 in top/bottom and borders); handling of non-straight 1 groups (e.g., ex2/3 have horizontal/ stepped 1s needing custom fills); bottom fill start (skipping 6) worked but right fill failed; no object extraction for 1 clusters, leading to rigid column-based adjustments that ignore shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same pattern of errors as training example 1, with top row all 7s (including right of the 1 at column 10), middle rows having left 7s, internal 8s, spine 1s, but right border and post-1 areas as 7s instead of expected 8s for openness; bottom row starts with 6 and 7s, but likely should have 8s right of the 1 similar to ex1. This suggests no spine or do_right=false, but fills wrongly closed right side with 7s—without input grid, assuming a vertical spine at column 10 (all rows have 1 there), the output should mirror ex1 with 8s extending right on top/bottom and middle right border as 8; current output closes everything to 7s, missing the subtle right-extension rule. To handle test, update fills to preserve/force 8s right of last 1 unless do_right=true, and ensure right border stays 8 without spine interference.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an n x n grid of integers (primarily 1s, 8s, and others like 6 or 7 in outputs) to detect a "spine" (a full vertical column of 1s), then transforming the grid by cleaning extraneous 1s to 8s, drawing asymmetric frames or borders with 7s around the spine area, and filling other regions; if no spine exists, apply basic border and bottom-row conversions of 8s to 7s. The goal is to produce a visually structured output that highlights the spine as a central element with surrounding frames, while handling non-spine cases with minimal border fills.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * A spine is strictly a column k where every row has exactly 1 in that position; multiple spines are not handled (function returns the first found).
 * When a spine is present, all other 1s (not in column k) must be converted to 8s first, but the spine's 1s remain untouched.
 * Framing for spines is asymmetric and position-dependent: for spine at k, it involves setting specific borders to 7 (e.g., left border upper rows if 8→7, column k-1 all rows if 8→7, top row 0 to k-1 if 8→7, bottom row 1 to k-1 if 8→7), but this misses right-side framing, inner fills, or adjustments for k near edges (e.g., no k-1 if k=0).
 * Non-spine cases require only basic fills: left border upper rows (0 to n-2, col 0) 8→7, right border all rows (col n-1) 8→7, bottom row all cols 8→7; no other changes, preserving internal 1s or 8s.
 * Bottom row often ends with a special pattern like [6,7,7,...,7] or similar, suggesting a fixed "base" fill that isn't fully handled (e.g., leftmost bottom might be 6 regardless).
 * Subtleties include: frames don't always fill entire regions (e.g., expected outputs show partial 7s forming L-shapes or enclosures around left/non-spine areas); 8s act as "temporary" fillers that get selectively converted to 7s for borders/frames, but not all 8s are converted (internal 8s often remain); spine position affects frame extent (e.g., in train2, spine at col4-5 with 1s, but frame needs to enclose left side differently); in larger grids like train3, diagonal or stepped 1s near spine aren't cleaned properly, leading to stray 1s.
 * Easy-to-miss: bottom row in non-spine or framed cases has unique fills (e.g., train2 expected bottom [6,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7] preserves some 1s while filling others); right borders may need conditional 7s based on spine proximity; upper-left corners often get full 7 rows in no-spine but partial in spine cases.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided): preserve original 1s in spine and bottom specials; handle edge cases like spine at col0 (no left frame) or near end; no diagonal or horizontal "spine" detection—only vertical full columns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_full_spine(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    for k in range(n):
        if all(g[i][k] == 1 for i in range(n)):
            return True, k
    return False, -1
```
(This function correctly identifies the first full column of 1s as the spine; useful as-is for detection, but may need extension for multiple spines or validation.)

```python
def clean_other_1s(g: List[List[int]], k: int):
    n = len(g)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if j != k and g[i][j] == 1:
                g[i][j] = 8
```
(This cleans non-spine 1s to 8s effectively, but modifies in-place; copy grid first to avoid side effects. Helpful for isolating the spine.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely a simple spine or no-spine case with basic borders).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated kept too many 8s in internal areas (e.g., rows 0-2 cols1-3,8-9 are 8s but expected 7s or mixed; row3 cols0-3,5-9 8s vs expected 7s in frame positions; row4 col0=1 preserved but surrounding 8s not framed to 7s; row8 col6=1 stray vs expected col6=1 but framed around; bottom row has 8s in cols1-3,7-9 vs expected 7s). What worked: detected spine at cols4-5 (dual 1s?), cleaned some 1s, basic left/right/bottom 7s. What didn't: incomplete asymmetric frame (missed top/bottom extensions beyond k, right-side 7s, inner left fills to 7s); didn't preserve exact bottom 1 positions while filling.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated treated as partial spine (1s in col12 rows0-3,5-9? but not full, so fell to non-spine basic fill), resulting in upper rows with full 8s and stray 1s (e.g., rows0-2 all cols1-11,13-19=8 vs expected 7s in left frames like row0 all 7s except col12=1; row3 col0=1 but cols1-11,13-19=8 vs expected 7s in col0-3,11; lower rows like row14-18 have 8s in col14-19=1s but no frame, vs expected 7s in col13 and 1s framed). What worked: basic non-spine border fills (left upper, right all, bottom to 7s where 8). What didn't: no spine detected (col12 has gaps in rows4,10-13?), so no cleaning/frame; missed stepped 1s near bottom-right needing enclosure; upper-left over-filled with 8s instead of 7-frame.
 * Overall, program understands spine detection and basic cleaning/framing but misses: position-specific frame rules (e.g., enclose left of spine with 7s, partial bottom fills); handling dual/adjacent 1s as possible non-spines; bottom row specials (6 start, preserve select 1s); larger grids with irregular 1 patterns.
 * Function `draw_frame` is partially helpful but broken for non-edge spines (e.g., only handles left/k-1/top-left/bottom-inner, misses right/enclosure; in-place mod, assumes k>0).
 * Function `fill_non_spine_basic` is mostly correct for borders but incomplete (e.g., doesn't handle bottom specials like 6 or preserve internal 1s fully; misses upper-left full 7s in some expects).
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., no blob/region detection), but not needed—puzzle is column-based, not object-oriented; avoid adding unless for irregular 1 groups.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it appears to detect a spine at column 10 (0-indexed, all rows have 1 there), cleans other 1s to 8s, but applies incomplete framing—e.g., top row has all 7s left then 1,8 (col11=8 should be framed?), rows1-10 have left col0=7, then 8s to col9=7, then 1,8 (right col11=8 not converted to 7 for border; internal 8s remain unfilled vs likely expected partial 7 frames enclosing left area like in train2/3); bottom row starts with 6 then 7s to col10=1, col11=8 (8 should be 7 for right border). This mismatches patterns from training expects, where frames create enclosed 7 regions around spine/left (e.g., more 7s in top/bottom extensions, right 7s); stray 8 at end suggests missed right-border rule. To fix, extend framing to include right col (n-1) 8→7 always in spine cases, and fill inner regions left of k more aggressively to 7s based on original 1 positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with values like 1 (solid/filled elements), 6 (special ground or base), 7 (resolved boundary or empty space), and 8 (unknowns to resolve). The goal is to process the input grid by selectively converting 8s to 7s based on border conditions, segment filling rules, and adjacency (dilation) to 1s, while respecting constraints like full vertical columns of 1s to avoid over-filling certain areas, likely simulating boundaries, shadows, or containment in a diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Border rules: Always fill leftmost column 8s to 7s. For rightmost column, fill 8s to 7s only if any non-bottom row has a 1 in the right column (has_right_1 condition). Top row: fill from left with 7s until the first 1 (inclusive? no, break before setting). Bottom row: fill from column 0 (or 1 if bottom-left is 6) with 7s until the first 1. If has_right_1, additionally fill top and bottom rows after the last 1 to the right end with 7s.
 * Segment filling subtleties: These are pre-dilation fills that establish initial boundaries. Bottom start skips column 0 if it's 6 to avoid overwriting. Fills stop strictly before a 1 (if g[i][j]==1, break without setting). Right extensions only apply if has_right_1, preventing premature right-border resolution.
 * Full vertical columns: Compute min_full as the leftmost column index where all rows are 1s (or n+1 if none). This acts as a "divider" or containment barrier—areas to the right of it may have different filling behavior.
 * Dilation rules: For each 8, check 8-directional adjacency to any 1 in the input g. If adjacent, set to 7 unless skipped: skip if min_full <=n and the adjacent 1's column q > min_full, or q==min_full and the current cell's j >=q. This prevents filling 8s in/near full columns from propagating incorrectly leftward or into contained areas. Order matters—dilation happens after border/segment fills, so it can override or extend them.
 * Subtle elements: 6 is preserved (e.g., bottom-left base) and doesn't trigger fills. 1s are never changed. Dilation uses input g for adjacency (not out), ensuring original solids drive resolution. If no full column (min_full=n+1), no skips—full dilation applies. Easy to miss: has_right_1 excludes bottom row for detection, but applies fills to all rows' right. In bottom row, if 6 present, j_start=1 avoids setting it to 7. Propagation doesn't chain (single-step dilation only).
 * General considerations: Grids vary in size; empty grid returns as-is. Outputs preserve 1s and 6s, resolve only 8s to 7s (no other values). Puzzle likely involves "growing" boundaries from 1s without crossing full vertical barriers or over-filling open right areas.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No custom classes or types in the attempt, but the min_full computation is helpful for identifying barriers
def compute_min_full(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    m, n = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    min_full = n + 1
    for j in range(n):
        is_full = all(g[i][j] == 1 for i in range(m))
        if is_full:
            min_full = min(min_full, j)
    return min_full
```

```python
# Directions for 8-way adjacency (helpful for dilation)
directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Helper to check has_right_1 (subtle: excludes bottom row)
def has_right_1_condition(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    m, n = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    return any(g[i][n - 1] == 1 for i in range(m - 1))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly handles basic left border filling (sets 8 to 7 in col 0 across all rows) in all examples.
 * Top row left segment fill works: stops before first 1 and sets to 7, matching expected in train 1 (7s up to col5 before 1 at col6).
 * Bottom row segment fill partially works: correctly starts at j=1 if bottom-left=6 and fills until first 1 (e.g., train 1 has 7s from col1-5), but fails to extend further in open areas (e.g., train 1 leaves 8s after the 1 at col12-15 as 8s, but expected fills them to 8s? Wait, expected has 8s there—no, expected bottom has 8s after col6's 1 up to end, but generated has 1s at end which shouldn't be—likely input 1s not overwritten, but code doesn't touch them; issue is not filling 8s to 7s post-1 in bottom).
 * has_right_1 detection works (true in train 1 and 3, enabling right fills), but right column fill is incomplete: sets rightmost 8s to 7 only if 8, but in train 1, right col is all 7? Expected right col has 8s in most rows—generated sets too many to 7 prematurely.
 * Right segment extensions (after last 1 in top/bottom) work in structure but over/under-apply: in train 1, top row generated has 7s to end after last1, but expected keeps 8s from col7 onward—code sets out[0][j]=7 for j>last1, but input has 1s at col10-11, so last1=11? Wait, code finds last1 as max j with g[0][j]==1, then fills after; but in train1 top: 7s to col5,1 at6,8s col7-9,1 at10,1 at11,7? col12-15—last1=11, fills col12-15 to7, but generated shows [7,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,1,1,7,7,7,7] yes, sets col12-15 to7, but expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]—so overfills col12-15 to7 instead of keeping 8s; subtle: perhaps right extensions shouldn't apply if not has_right_1 properly, but it is.
 * Dilation core works in train 2 (full correct), propagating 7s from 1-adjacent 8s, but fails in train1/3 due to skip logic: in train1, min_full likely none (n+1=16), so no skips, but generated leaves many 8s in middle-right as 8s (e.g., rows1-15 col7-15 mostly 8s, but expected fills more to8? No, expected has 8s there too, but differences in bottom: generated bottom has 1,1,1,1 at end but expected 8s—input probably has no 1s there, code didn't set them; wait, generated bottom [6,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1] vs expected [6,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]—generated incorrectly has 1s at col12-15, but that's likely input 1s, and code should have dilated adjacent 8s but not change 1s; issue is not filling the 8s between col6's1 and col12's1s to7? Dilation should catch them if adjacent.
 * In train3, dilation skip misapplies around min_full (likely col12 or so, full 1s?): generated row9 [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,1,7,8,...] vs expected [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,...]—generated inserts 7,7,1,7 around col10-13 instead of 8,8,1,8; similar in row10/11, where 7s appear left of 1s in expected 8 areas, suggesting skip logic blocks filling right of min_full incorrectly (e.g., q==min_full and j>=q skips too much, preventing boundary growth into contained regions). Row8 generated matches expected. Bottom row matches.
 * No object extraction function attempted; not relevant here (puzzle is grid-based resolution, not object detection). The dilation loop is helpful but broken in skip condition—it's overly restrictive, blocking valid fills near full columns (e.g., doesn't allow 8-to-7 if adjacent 1 is in/after min_full when j is nearby).
 * Border fills override out copy but dilation checks g, preventing feedback loops—good, but in train1, dilation doesn't fill bottom row's post-1 8s (col7-11,13-15?) because not adjacent to any 1? Col7-11 are 8s adjacent to col6's1 vertically? No, bottom row horizontal adjacency to col6=1 should set col7=7 if g[15][6]==1, but generated keeps 8—bug: dilation is for i,j in all, but perhaps order (row-major) misses if not revisited.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The right segment fill after last1 overfills open areas in train1 (sets to7 where expected 8s, like top col12-15). Bottom segment doesn't handle post-1 fills at all. No function for extracting segments or barriers beyond min_full—would help for complex shapes in train3.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense structurally (e.g., left borders filled to7, top/bottom segments to7 before 1s, dilation grows 7s around 1 clusters), but does not look fully correct—likely overfills or underfills due to same issues as train1/3. For example, row0 has 7s to col9 before1 at col10, then7 at col11—expected probably keeps col11 as8 if it's an open area post-1 without right extension. Row11 [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,1,1,1] has isolated8 at col7 and7 at col8 before1s, suggesting dilation skip or border logic incorrectly resolves near bottom 1s/6—expected might extend8s further left in bottom or fill the8 to7 consistently. Row4-6 have7s dipping into1 areas (e.g., row4 [7,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,1,7]—two7s before1 at col10, but if input has1s at col7-9? No, generated shows7s replacing likely8s, but pattern suggests incomplete propagation right of vertical1s. Bottom row [6,7,1,1,1,1,7,8,7,1,1,1] starts with6,7 then jumps to1s—likely underfills, missing7s between6 and first1s (if input has8s there), and has stray8 at col7 not dilated to7 adjacent to1s at col2-5/8-11. Overall, inconsistencies around1 clusters and potential min_full (maybe col10 full1s?) indicate skip logic blocks valid fills, similar to train3 mismatches—test needs better handling of contained regions right of barriers without over-resolving left extensions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing a floor plan, maze, or architectural diagram with 1s as walls or lines) where the goal is to process the input grid and output a modified version that highlights boundaries, fills certain areas, and distinguishes core structures like "spines" (full vertical columns of 1s) using numbers like 6, 7, and 8 to indicate different types of wall segments or invalid placements. The processing prioritizes border treatments, connected components of 1s, and conditional filling based on the presence of a spine, aiming to "clean" or classify non-essential 1s while preserving structural integrity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * A "spine" is a full column (from top to bottom) entirely filled with 1s; if present, non-spine 1s are marked as 8 (temporary invalid), then specific left-side and border positions are downgraded to 7 (valid boundary), with top and bottom rows filled leftward only up to the first 1.
 * Without a spine, handle borders more symmetrically: left border always gets 7s for 8s, right border gets 7s only if there's a 1 on the right edge (excluding bottom row), and top/bottom rows fill left of first 1 and right of last 1 with 7s; additionally, apply "dilation" to inner 8s adjacent to valid border-touching 1-components, setting them to 7.
 * Subtle border handling: Bottom-left cell can be pre-marked as 6 in input (possibly a special floor or entry point), which affects fill starting points (e.g., skip col 0 if it's 6); left-of-spine cells get 7s regardless of connectivity.
 * Connected components of 1s: Only those touching any border are "valid" and can influence dilation (turning adjacent inner 8s to 7s); use 4-directional connectivity for components, but 8-directional for dilation checks.
 * Edge cases: Grids <=2x2 skip dilation; no full right-border 1s means right side stays 8-heavy; top/bottom fills are asymmetric (left-only in spine case, bidirectional in no-spine); preserve original 1s in spines or valid positions.
 * Potential misses: Over-filling right side in no-spine cases if right border isn't fully checked; dilation only applies to middle rows (1 to n-2) and only if adjacent to valid_ones; visited tracking prevents recounting in components.
 * Input may have pre-existing 6s or 7s (e.g., bottom-left 6), which aren't overwritten unless specified; output should not alter original 1s unless they're non-spine.

                        out[i][j] = 7
                        break  # Turns inner 8s to 7s if adjacent to valid 1s; only middle rows
```

(Note: Functions like get_minj_after and get_maxj are helpful for row fills but are simple scans; no types beyond List[List[int]] are used, but Tuple[int,int] for positions is useful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it successfully handled all three training examples (1,2,3 marked CORRECT), demonstrating solid understanding of spine detection, border filling, and basic no-spine logic.
 * What worked: Accurate spine identification and left-side prioritization in spine cases (e.g., setting left border and left-of-spine to 7, leftward top/bottom fills); no-spine border symmetry and dilation correctly applied in training cases, preserving 1s and using 8 as temp invalid marker.
 * What didn't work: In potential edge cases (inferred from code), bottom row fill start skips col 0 only if it's already 6 (pre-input special), but code checks out[i_bot][0] post-left-border set (which turns 8 to 7), so it may always start at 0 unless input has 6—could mismatch if input 6s are overwritten incorrectly; right border in spine case is never set to 7 (stays 8), which worked for training but may over-mark right side as invalid.
 * Dilation is only in no-spine branch and skips borders/middles appropriately, but uses out for checks (post-8 marking) while valid_ones uses original g—consistent but subtle if input has non-1s affecting components.
 * No prior attempts shown, but code includes untested elements like has_right = any(g[i][n-1]==1 for i in range(n-1)) (excludes bottom row, subtle exclusion); get_valid_ones is essential and correct for connectivity, but could be extended to 8-dir if puzzle needs diagonal touches (not currently).
 * Overall, core logic passed training, but subtle input assumptions (e.g., pre-existing 6s) and asymmetric right handling in spine cases may need tweaks for broader cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x12 grid with a clear spine at column 10 (all rows have 1 there), left column all 7s except bottom 6, top/bottom rows filled leftward with 7s up to col 9, middle rows have left 7 then 8s turning to 7 at col 9 before the 1 and final 8 at col 11—consistent with spine-case logic (no right filling, no dilation since spine branch skips it).
 * It makes sense per the code: Non-spine 1s marked 8, left border/left-of-spine (col 9) set to 7, top/bottom left fills to 7, bottom-left preserved as 6 (implies input had 6 there, not overwritten), right column stays 8 (no has_right check in spine case, correctly per code).
 * However, it may not be fully correct if the puzzle expects dilation or right-border treatment even in spine cases (e.g., inner 8s in middle rows stay 8 except col 9, but if test input has border-touching components on right, they aren't influencing anything); the all-8 middle-right looks under-filled compared to potential expectations for symmetric boundary highlighting—different from what might be expected if no-spine logic (with dilation) should bleed into spine cases for connected 1s.
 * Rightmost column all 8s suggests no right-border 7s, which matches code but could be wrong if test input has right-edge 1s warranting 7s (unknown without input grid, but output asymmetry hints at over-reliance on spine left-bias).
 * Bottom row starts fill at col 1 (due to 6 at [11][0]), filling 7s to col 9, which is correct per code but subtly different if puzzle wants full left fill including over 6.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:46:39] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an input grid (n x n, with cells containing numbers like 1 for filled regions, 6 for special bottom-left markers, and possibly others) to produce an output grid where certain areas are marked as 7 (filled/expanded regions) or left as 8 (unfilled or invalid expansions), based on rules about "spines" (full columns of 1s), border-touching connected components of 1s, and segment-based filling on top/bottom rows. The goal is to expand or validate 1-regions that touch borders, dilate adjacent empty areas to 7, and handle special cases like spines or bottom-left 6s, while preserving 1s and converting invalid 1s or empties appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Detect if there's a "full spine" (an entire column of all 1s); if yes, treat that column k specially—convert all other 1s to 8 (invalid), then fill left of k (column k-1 fully to 7 where 8), left borders/top/bottom-left to 7 where 8, but skip bottom-left if it's 6.
 * No-spine case: Mark all border-touching connected components of 1s as "valid" (using 4-directional BFS to find components, only if any cell in component touches any border); then dilate inner (non-border) 8s to 7 if adjacent (8-directional) to any valid 1.
 * Border handling: Always convert left-border 8s (rows 0 to n-2) to 7; right-border 8s (all rows) to 7.
 * Top row filling: For the segment(s) of 1s in row 0, fill left and right gaps (where 8) to 7, but only outside the min-max j of 1s in that row.
 * Bottom row filling: Similar to top, but start j from 1 (not 0) if bottom-left (row n-1, col 0) is 6, to avoid overwriting the 6; fill left/right gaps outside min-max j of 1s in bottom row to 7 where 8.
 * Subtleties: Dilation only applies to inner cells (i=1 to n-2, all j), and only if adjacent to valid 1s—miss this and inner 8s stay 8 incorrectly. Components must touch any border (top/bottom/left/right) to be valid; isolated inner 1-components stay as 1 but their adjacent 8s don't dilate. n<=2 is a special case (no dilation). Preserve original 1s and non-1s (e.g., 6 stays 6). Input may have pre-marked 8s or other numbers, but focus is on 1s and converting 8s. Easy to miss: Bottom filling skips col 0 if 6, but still fills from j_start to minj and maxj+1 to n. Top/bottom segment filling is per-row, independent of other rows' 1s.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return []
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(A basic deep copy, essential for non-destructive processing.)

```python
def has_full_spine(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return False, -1
    for col in range(n):
        if all(g[row][col] == 1 for row in range(n)):
            return True, col
    return False, -1
```
(Detects spine column accurately; used in main logic branch.)

```python
def get_valid_ones(g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    valid_ones: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    directions4 = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(n):
            if g[r][c] == 1 and not visited[r][c]:
                comp = []
                q = deque([(r, c)])
                visited[r][c] = True
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions4:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == 1 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                touches_border = any(xx == 0 or xx == n - 1 or yy == 0 or yy == n - 1 for xx, yy in comp)
                if touches_border:
                    for pos in comp:
                        valid_ones.add(pos)
    return valid_ones
```
(BFS for 4-connected components of 1s, validates if touches border; crucial for no-spine dilation. Helpful for extracting border-touching objects.)

```python
def apply_dilation(out: List[List[int]], valid_ones: Set[Tuple[int, int]], n: int) -> None:
    if n <= 2:
        return
    directions8 = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        for j in range(n):
            if out[i][j] == 8:
                for di, dj in directions8:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and (ni, nj) in valid_ones:
                        out[i][j] = 7
                        break
```
(8-directional dilation of inner 8s to 7 if touching valid 1s; key for expansion rule, skips borders and small n.)

```python
def find_minj_maxj(g: List[List[int]], row: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    minj = n
    maxj = -1
    for j in range(n):
        if g[row][j] == 1:
            minj = min(minj, j)
            maxj = max(maxj, j)
    return minj, maxj
```
(Finds extent of 1-segments in a row for gap-filling; used in top/bottom fills.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it builds on implied prior logic for spine detection and component validation.
 * Spine branch works well: Cleans other 1s to 8, fills left column/top/bottom appropriately, respects 6 in bottom-left.
 * No-spine branch mostly functional: Border marking, valid components, and dilation capture border-touching expansions, but top/bottom segment fills are row-specific and may overfill if 1s are sparse.
 * clean_other_1s is helpful for spine case but not used elsewhere—converts non-spine 1s to 8 correctly in that branch.
 * apply_left_border, apply_right_border, apply_column_fill are simple and effective for border/adjacent fills.
 * apply_top_fill_left and apply_bottom_fill_left are spine-specific and handle left-side filling well, including 6 skip.
 * apply_top_fill_segments and apply_bottom_fill_segments extend gap-filling to no-spine, but may incorrectly fill if input row has no 1s (minj=n, maxj=-1 leads to full row fill except borders).
 * get_valid_ones is essential and correct for identifying border-touching 1-components.
 * apply_dilation is mostly correct but only checks inner rows/cols for 8s—could miss if valid_ones are on border but dilation targets inner.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though spine-specific ones (e.g., clean_other_1s) are branch-limited and not broken.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (n=12 grid) shows left column mostly 7s (rows 0-10) with 6 at bottom-left (row 11, col 0), right column mixed 7/8, a vertical spine-like column of 1s at col 10 (all rows), inner areas as 8s, top row all 7s left of col 10 then 1/8, and bottom row 6 then 7s to col 9 then 1/8.
 * It appears to come from the no-spine branch (since other 1s aren't cleaned to 8, and there's dilation/fills), but if test input has a near-spine at col 10 with border-touching 1s, the left-fill to 7s and bottom 6 preservation make sense; however, inner 8s dominate (rows 1-10, cols 1-9 and 11), suggesting limited dilation—expected more 7s if valid_ones include col 10 and adjacent areas, as 8s should dilate to 7 near the 1-column.
 * The output does not look fully correct: Top row is overfilled with 7s (all left of col 10), which matches apply_top_fill_segments if row 0 has 1 only at col 10, but bottom row starts with 6 then 7s, correctly skipping col 0 per rule; however, right col (col 11) has 8s in most rows (only row 0 is 8, but wait—output shows row 0 col 11=8, rows 1-11 col 11=8? Wait, rows 1-10: ends with 8, row 11:8), so apply_right_border didn't convert them to 7 if they were 8—possible bug if input had non-8 there or border apply missed. Inner 8s persist, which is correct only if no valid_ones adjacent, but with col 10=1s (likely valid as touches top/bottom), dilation should turn col 9 and col 11 inners to 7— the lack of this suggests either test input has no border-touch for col 10 1s (unlikely for full column) or dilation is broken (e.g., doesn't trigger on border 1s). Overall, partial match but missing expected inner fills near the 1-column; it's different from expected (more 7s in cols 9/11 inners) for unknown reason (possibly dilation scope or valid_ones misdetection).

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of only those interactions, connections, or effects between components/properties that are **obvious, direct, and consistent across EVERY example** (i.e., they occur identically in all three pairs, without variation or exceptions). I focused solely on patterns where a property of one element reliably affects or transforms another, or where components are linked in a repeatable way. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated blues with no transformation) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., blue disappearances, which only occur in Train 1; pixel increases in non-(0,0) Maroons, which only occur in Train 1; or full-rectangle filling, absent in Trains 2 and 3) are not included. Unknowns (e.g., exact pixel calculation for Dark Red, which varies but preserves total with inner Maroon) are noted as such rather than speculated.

1. **Maroon component with bbox starting at [0,0,...] → Dark Red component creation and transformation**:
   - The Maroon component whose bbox min-coordinates are exactly (0,0) consistently transforms into (or spawns) a new Dark Red component.
   - Connection: Bbox of Dark Red = exact same bbox as the input (0,0)-starting Maroon.
   - Effect: Holes property of Dark Red is always set to 1 (regardless of input Maroon's holes value: 0 in Trains 1 and 2, 1 in Train 3).
   - Effect: Pixels of Dark Red are reduced from the input Maroon's pixels (specific reduction amount unknown/uncalculable from data, but consistently less than input).
   - This interaction preserves the overall structure but introduces Dark Red as an outer/nested layer relative to other outputs.

2. **Maroon component with bbox starting at [0,0,...] → New inset Maroon component creation**:
   - The same (0,0)-starting Maroon consistently spawns a new Maroon component inset within it.
   - Connection: Bbox of new Maroon = input (0,0)-Maroon's bbox modified by +1 to min-x and min-y, -1 to max-x and max-y (e.g., [0,0,5,15] → [1,1,4,14]; [0,0,9,9] → [1,1,8,8]; [0,0,19,19] → [1,1,18,18]).
   - Effect: Holes property of new Maroon = exactly the same as the input (0,0)-starting Maroon's holes (0 in Trains 1 and 2, 1 in Train 3).
   - Effect: Pixels of new Maroon = input (0,0)-Maroon's pixels minus Dark Red's pixels (total always preserved: sum equals original Maroon pixels).

3. **(0,0)-starting Maroon pixels → Combined Dark Red + inset Maroon pixels (preservation)**:
   - The pixels property of the input (0,0)-starting Maroon consistently affects the pixels of the output Dark Red and inset Maroon as a pair.
   - Connection: Total pixels (Dark Red pixels + inset Maroon pixels) = exactly the input (0,0)-starting Maroon's pixels (95=39+56 in Train 1; 86=49+37 in Train 2; 335=95+240 in Train 3).
   - Effect: This creates a nested/partitioned structure where the original pixels are redistributed without loss or gain.

4. **Pink component → No transformation (position, holes, pixels)**:
   - The single-pixel Pink component (always at bbox [0, height, 0, height] where height matches the canvas bottom, e.g., [0,15,0,15], [0,9,0,9], [0,19,0,19]) consistently has no interaction with any other component.
   - Connection: Its position (bottom-left edge), holes=0, and pixels=1 remain identical in input and output across all examples.
   - Effect: Unaffected by any Maroon or Dark Red transformations, or by blue positions/colors.

5. **Blue components (general) → Preservation when unchanged**:
   - Blue components that appear in outputs consistently match identical input Blues in bbox, holes=0, and pixels (e.g., vertical or scattered Blues like [6,0,6,15] in Train 1, [4,0,5,2] in Train 2, [0,3,4,8] in Train 3).
   - Connection: No color change (remain Blue) or holes change (remain 0); position (bbox) unchanged.
   - Effect: These Blues do not interact with or alter the (0,0)-Maroon → Dark Red/inset Maroon transformation (they coexist without affecting pixels, holes, or bboxes of the Maroon/Dark Red pair).
   - Note: Not all input Blues always persist (inconsistent across examples), but when they do, the properties are preserved exactly.

### Notes on Scope and Unknowns
- These are the only patterns that hold without exception across all three train pairs. No other connections (e.g., blue position affecting Maroon holes, or color shifts beyond Dark Red introduction) are consistent in every example.
- No semantic meaning (e.g., "frames" or "borders") is assumed or forced; connections are based purely on observable properties (bbox, holes, pixels, color).
- Unknown: Exact rule for Dark Red pixels (always reduced but varies: 39/95, 49/86, 95/335); not consistent enough to explain transformation fully.
- No high-level puzzle solution inferred; only pairwise component/property links listed.
- For the test input, these patterns could apply to its Maroon [0,0,9,11] (starts at 0,0), but no further analysis performed as instructed.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 04:48:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of only those interactions, connections, or effects between components/properties that are **obvious, direct, and consistent across EVERY example** (i.e., they occur identically in all three pairs, without variation or exceptions). I focused solely on patterns where a property of one element reliably affects or transforms another, or where components are linked in a repeatable way. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated blues with no transformation) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., blue disappearances, which only occur in Train 1; pixel increases in non-(0,0) Maroons, which only occur in Train 1; or full-rectangle filling, absent in Trains 2 and 3) are not included. Unknowns (e.g., exact pixel calculation for Dark Red, which varies but preserves total with inner Maroon) are noted as such rather than speculated.

1. **Maroon component with bbox starting at [0,0,...] → Dark Red component creation and transformation**:
   - The Maroon component whose bbox min-coordinates are exactly (0,0) consistently transforms into (or spawns) a new Dark Red component.
   - Connection: Bbox of Dark Red = exact same bbox as the input (0,0)-starting Maroon.
   - Effect: Holes property of Dark Red is always set to 1 (regardless of input Maroon's holes value: 0 in Trains 1 and 2, 1 in Train 3).
   - Effect: Pixels of Dark Red are reduced from the input Maroon's pixels (specific reduction amount unknown/uncalculable from data, but consistently less than input).
   - This interaction preserves the overall structure but introduces Dark Red as an outer/nested layer relative to other outputs.

2. **Maroon component with bbox starting at [0,0,...] → New inset Maroon component creation**:
   - The same (0,0)-starting Maroon consistently spawns a new Maroon component inset within it.
   - Connection: Bbox of new Maroon = input (0,0)-Maroon's bbox modified by +1 to min-x and min-y, -1 to max-x and max-y (e.g., [0,0,5,15] → [1,1,4,14]; [0,0,9,9] → [1,1,8,8]; [0,0,19,19] → [1,1,18,18]).
   - Effect: Holes property of new Maroon = exactly the same as the input (0,0)-starting Maroon's holes (0 in Trains 1 and 2, 1 in Train 3).
   - Effect: Pixels of new Maroon = input (0,0)-Maroon's pixels minus Dark Red's pixels (total always preserved: sum equals original Maroon pixels).

3. **(0,0)-starting Maroon pixels → Combined Dark Red + inset Maroon pixels (preservation)**:
   - The pixels property of the input (0,0)-starting Maroon consistently affects the pixels of the output Dark Red and inset Maroon as a pair.
   - Connection: Total pixels (Dark Red pixels + inset Maroon pixels) = exactly the input (0,0)-starting Maroon's pixels (95=39+56 in Train 1; 86=49+37 in Train 2; 335=95+240 in Train 3).
   - Effect: This creates a nested/partitioned structure where the original pixels are redistributed without loss or gain.

4. **Pink component → No transformation (position, holes, pixels)**:
   - The single-pixel Pink component (always at bbox [0, height, 0, height] where height matches the canvas bottom, e.g., [0,15,0,15], [0,9,0,9], [0,19,0,19]) consistently has no interaction with any other component.
   - Connection: Its position (bottom-left edge), holes=0, and pixels=1 remain identical in input and output across all examples.
   - Effect: Unaffected by any Maroon or Dark Red transformations, or by blue positions/colors.

5. **Blue components (general) → Preservation when unchanged**:
   - Blue components that appear in outputs consistently match identical input Blues in bbox, holes=0, and pixels (e.g., vertical or scattered Blues like [6,0,6,15] in Train 1, [4,0,5,2] in Train 2, [0,3,4,8] in Train 3).
   - Connection: No color change (remain Blue) or holes change (remain 0); position (bbox) unchanged.
   - Effect: These Blues do not interact with or alter the (0,0)-Maroon → Dark Red/inset Maroon transformation (they coexist without affecting pixels, holes, or bboxes of the Maroon/Dark Red pair).
   - Note: Not all input Blues always persist (inconsistent across examples), but when they do, the properties are preserved exactly.

### Notes on Scope and Unknowns
- These are the only patterns that hold without exception across all three train pairs. No other connections (e.g., blue position affecting Maroon holes, or color shifts beyond Dark Red introduction) are consistent in every example.
- No semantic meaning (e.g., "frames" or "borders") is assumed or forced; connections are based purely on observable properties (bbox, holes, pixels, color).
- Unknown: Exact rule for Dark Red pixels (always reduced but varies: 39/95, 49/86, 95/335); not consistent enough to explain transformation fully.
- No high-level puzzle solution inferred; only pairwise component/property links listed.
- For the test input, these patterns could apply to its Maroon [0,0,9,11] (starts at 0,0), but no further analysis performed as instructed.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 04:56:57] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving connected components on a 2D grid with values like 8 (likely the "main" or background material), 1 (blue or secondary objects), 7 (boundary marker), and 6 (a special unchanging element, possibly a "key" or anchor at the bottom-left). The goal is to process the grid by identifying a main 8-component connected to the top-left, absorbing non-adjacent 1-components into 8's, preserving adjacent 1's, marking the outer boundary of the expanded main component with 7's while filling its interior with 8's, and leaving other elements (like internal 1's or the 6) intact.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The main component is strictly the connected 8's starting from (0,0) if g[0][0] == 8; it does not consider other disconnected 8's or the largest 8-component—only the top-left-connected one.
 * Connected components use 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); no diagonals.
 * For 1's (blues): Find all connected components of 1's. If a 1-component is not adjacent (via 4-directions) to any cell in the main 8-component, absorb it entirely by changing those cells to 8 (merging into main). If it is adjacent, leave it as 1's (these are "attached" or "island" features that stay).
 * After processing 1's, update the main component's cells: Set boundary cells (those with any 4-directional or perhaps 8-directional neighbor outside the component or out-of-bounds) to 7, and interior cells to 8. The boundary detection must be precise—subtly, it seems to use 8-directional neighborhood checks for boundary (3x3 excluding center), as simple 4-dir might miss edges.
 * The 6 is unchanged and appears fixed at the bottom-left corner across examples, possibly a "seed" or unrelated to processing.
 * Grids vary in size; output must match input dimensions exactly, as a deep copy with modifications.
 * Subtle: Absorption of 1's happens before boundary marking, so absorbed 1's expand the main_set for boundary calculation. Non-absorbed 1's can create "indentations" in the boundary, affecting where 7's are placed (e.g., 7's might hug around preserved 1's).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; if no main (g[0][0] != 8), no processing. Preserved 1's can be vertical/horizontal lines or blobs that touch the main at any point.
 * Common miss: Boundary detection over-marking interiors as 7's (e.g., due to flawed neighbor checks) or under-marking edges; adjacency for 1's must check against the original main_set, not expanded.
 * Visually, the result often forms a "frame" of 7's around a large 8-block, with preserved 1's as internal features, and 6 at bottom-left.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core logic for main component extraction and 1-component flood-fill works well, correctly identifying connected groups and using stack-based DFS.
 * Absorption of non-adjacent 1's to 8 succeeds in most cases, preserving adjacent 1's (e.g., vertical 1-lines touching main stay as 1's).
 * Boundary marking partially works but fails subtly: Over-marks some interior/near-edge cells as 7 instead of 8, possibly due to 8-dir check being too aggressive or not accounting for absorbed 1's expanding the effective boundary.
 * Train 1: Generated marks (14,1) as 7 but expected 8 (interior should be 8; boundary detection wrongly flags it as edge near the bottom 7's). Rows 0-13 and 15 match expected, so absorption and most boundaries correct.
 * Train 2: Generated has (8,1) as 7 but expected 8 (another interior misclassified as boundary, near preserved 1's). Also (0,4-5) are 1's (correct, preserved), but boundary around them inconsistent.
 * Train 3: Generated has row 9 as [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,1,7,8,...] but expected [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,...]—misplaces 7's at (9,8-9) and (9,11), under-marking interiors as 7's or failing to absorb a small 1-group into 8's at (9,10). Row 10-11 have 1's preserved correctly, but boundary hugs wrong around them.
 * is_boundary_pos is helpful but broken for some concave shapes or near preserved 1's (flags too many as boundary; consider if it should ignore preserved 1's as "internal" or adjust to 4-dir only).
 * Overall, program structure (copy grid, process 1's first, then mark boundaries) is solid, but visited matrix is only for 1's—main uses separate visited, which is fine but could be unified.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though is_boundary_pos needs fix (e.g., perhaps exclude directions toward preserved 1's or use post-absorption main_set update).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It shows a 7-frame around a large 8-block, preserved 1's in columns 10-11 (likely adjacent to main), and 6 at (11,0), with absorption of some 1's (e.g., row 4-6 has 1's only in col 7-10, suggesting a blob was partially preserved). However, it does not look fully correct—boundaries seem inconsistent (e.g., row 11 has [6,7,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1,1,1], placing 7's around bottom 1's but possibly over-marking (11,2-5) as 1's when they might need absorption if not adjacent; row 3 has 7's in col 6-9 but 8's elsewhere, which might miss hugging a preserved 1-blob). Compared to training patterns, it likely misclassifies some boundaries near the bottom 1's (similar to train errors), and without expected, it appears to have the same interior-over-marking issue (e.g., (10,7) as 8 but nearby might be wrong). To handle test, update boundary to re-flood after absorption and use stricter 4-dir for edges.
