=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 19:20:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:32:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to transform an input grid by changing certain 8's (likely representing walls or boundaries) to 7's (likely representing marked or exterior boundaries), based on connectivity from specific "source" entry points and proximity to 1's (possibly empty spaces or objects). The rules involve identifying connected components of 8's reachable from border sources, then selectively marking them as 7's if they are sources, on borders, or adjacent to 1's, while leaving interior or disconnected 8's as 8's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Sources are defined on the left border (any 8's), top row (consecutive 8's starting from left), and bottom row (consecutive 8's starting from left, but skip the first column if it's a 6, which seems to indicate a special "exit" or non-source marker).
 * Exterior 8's are those connected via flood-fill (4-directional adjacency) to any source, treating only 8's as traversable— this identifies "outer" walls reachable from the perimeter.
 * An 8 is changed to 7 if: (1) it is a source itself, (2) it is exterior and adjacent (8-directional? but code uses 8-dir for adj check) to at least one 1, or (3) it is exterior and on any grid border (top, bottom, left, right). This seems aimed at outlining or highlighting perimeter exposures, but ignores interior 8's even if exterior-marked.
 * Subtlety: Bottom source handling is asymmetric—if bottom-left is 6, sources start from column 1 onward for consecutive 8's, suggesting 6 acts as a "closed" or non-entry point (seen in train1 and test). Top sources always start from column 0.
 * Flood-fill only marks connected 8's, so disconnected 8 regions (e.g., interior islands) stay 8 and are never changed, which is correct for isolating "outer" vs "inner" structures.
 * Adjacency to 1's is checked in 8 directions (including diagonals), which captures "touching" exposures but might over-mark if 1's are diagonal-only.
 * Borders are privileged: exterior 8's on edges get marked even without adj to 1, simulating open perimeter.
 * Grids vary in size (16x16 for train1, 20x20 for train3, 12x12 for test), so code must handle arbitrary n.
 * 1's and 6's are unchanged—1's are likely "air" or objects that trigger marking, 6 is a special bottom-left marker (possibly an "entrance" that doesn't propagate as source).
 * Potential miss: Over-marking interior exposures—if a 1 is inside but touches exterior 8's, it might incorrectly mark deeper 8's; but flood limits to connected exteriors.
 * Another subtlety: Sources include only initial border segments, not full borders, so partial border 8's might not trigger full exterior if broken by non-8's.
 * Non-8 cells (like 1's, 6's) block flood-fill, ensuring only 8-connected exteriors are marked.
 * In outputs, rows with 1's or 6's stay as-is, and changes only affect 8's—confirm no accidental overwrites.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but the main `program` function integrates the above incorrectly for some cases (see below)—it applies marking rules too broadly without excluding certain exterior regions. No object extraction functions present, as the puzzle doesn't seem to require parsing "objects" beyond 1's and 8's; adding one (e.g., for blob counting) would be irrelevant and distract from boundary rules.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly handles train2 (full exterior marking works for that case, likely a simple enclosed shape).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated over-marks bottom-right 8's as 7's? Wait, no—looking closely, generated row0 has 1's at cols10-11 where expected has 8's, but that's impossible since program doesn't change 1's to 8's; likely a printing/input error in description, but actual diff is in rows12-15 cols12-15: generated keeps some 8's as 8 but inserts 1's? Wait, generated row12: [7,8,8,8,8,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1] vs expected [7,8,8,8,8,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]—so generated incorrectly leaves cols12-15 as 1's (but 1's are input, unchanged), wait no, mismatch suggests program didn't change surrounding 8's to 7's properly, or flood didn't reach bottom-right 8's, leaving them 8 while expected marks more as 7? Actually, expected has more 8's preserved in bottom-right (cols12-15 rows12-15 are 8's in expected, but generated has 1's there—implying input has 1's, but expected output changes them? Contradiction; likely the "1,1,1,1" in generated row12-15 is from input, and issue is failure to mark adjacent 8's as 7's in bottom-left or something. Unknown exact diff cause, but bottom 6-handling partially works yet misses right-side propagation.
 * Train3 incorrect: Generated mismatches in row9 cols10-11 (generated 7,7,1,7 vs expected 8,8,1,8? Wait, row9: generated [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,1,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7] vs expected [7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7]—so generated marks extra interior 8's as 7's around the 1 (cols8-9 as 7,7 instead of 8,8), suggesting over-flooding or wrong adj check propagating into a disconnected or inner region. Also row12 has 7's where expected 8's. Flood from sources marks too much interior near 1's.
 * Overall: Source detection works (handles 6 skip), flood works for connected exteriors, but marking logic over-applies to non-border interiors adjacent to 1's (e.g., train3 inner 8's near 1 become 7 wrongly). Border marking is good but combines poorly with adj-to-1, causing leaks. No object extraction needed; focus on refining marking conditions to exclude inner exposures.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct— it follows the attempt's logic (e.g., left column mostly 7's from sources, bottom starts with 6 then 7's, some right-side 8's preserved), but likely over-marks or under-marks similar to train3. For example, row11 [6,7,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1,1,1] has 7's at cols6-8 where they might be interior exposures to the 1's at cols1-5 and 9-11, but if those 1's are an inner "object," expected should keep surrounding 8's as 8's unless border-adj; this looks like the same over-marking issue as train3 (adj-to-1 triggers 7 on non-perimeter 8's). Row7 [7,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,1,1,1,8] has 7's at col6-7 near 1's at col8-10, suggesting incorrect interior marking. Right column has many 8's preserved, which is good if disconnected, but row3 col11=8 vs potential border marking miss. Bottom-right 1's are unchanged (correct), but adjacent 8's (e.g., row4 col11=8) might need 7 if exterior. Overall, doesn't fully match expected perimeter-only outlining—too many inner 7's near 1-clusters, ignoring that some 1's may be enclosed without exposing interiors.
