=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:28:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-09-30 19:44:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with numbers representing colors or states (1 as barriers/walls, 8 as empty/fillable spaces in maroon, 6 as a pink starting seed, and 7 as the target dark red fill), where the task is to selectively fill certain 8's with 7's based on their connection to the 6, while respecting 1's as blockers, but not simply flooding the entire connected component of 8's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The 6 acts as a seed point, and adjacent 8's should initiate a fill to 7, but the fill does not propagate to the entire connected component of 8's—instead, it appears to target only specific "enclosed" or boundary-adjacent regions near the 6, leaving many connected 8's unchanged (e.g., outer or distant 8's remain 8).
 * 1's are strict barriers that stop propagation, but the current flood fill ignores subtle enclosure rules, overfilling areas that seem connected but should remain 8 based on the expected outputs (e.g., large blocks of 8's adjacent to filled areas stay unfilled).
 * The fill seems to prioritize "interior" or outline-like patterns around the 6, such as horizontal/vertical extensions from the 6's position (e.g., in train 1 expected, only positions 0 and 5 in upper rows are 7, forming a shape, while columns 1-4 are 8 despite connectivity).
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 16x16 for train 1, 10x10 for train 2, 20x20 for train 3, 12x12 for test), and the 6 is always at the bottom-leftish area; fills do not cross the entire grid uniformly.
 * Subtle element: Fills may follow "shape completion" rules, like matching a predefined object outline containing the 6, rather than pure connectivity—e.g., in train 2, a curvy shape of 8's is partially filled to form a blob with 7's on edges near 6, but internal 8's in some areas remain.
 * Easy to miss: The 6 itself remains unchanged (not filled to 7), and no diagonal propagation (only 4-directional, which the code gets right); overfilling happens because the code treats all 8-connected spaces as fillable, but expected shows disconnected or "outer" 8's untouched even if path-connected via 8's.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes full component fill, which fails; need to detect enclosed regions (e.g., via boundary tracing around 6) or limit fill depth/direction; inputs likely have 8's forming loops or mazes around 6, where flood escapes enclosures incorrectly.
 * Potential broken assumption: 8's might represent both fillable interior and exterior space, requiring separation (e.g., flood from 6 but stop at "outer" boundaries or use winding rules for enclosure).

                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly copies the grid and locates the 6, but the flood fill overfills entire connected 8-components, changing distant or outer 8's to 7's that should remain 8.
 * In train 1, generated fills left columns 0-5 with 7's across most rows (e.g., row 0: first 6 as 7's, then 1, partial 8's with extra 1's), but expected has sparse 7's (e.g., row 0: only first 6 as 7's then 1 and all 8's; rows 1-14: 7 at col 0 and 5, 8's elsewhere; row 15: 6 then 5 7's)—difference: overfilled columns 1-4 and right-side 8's incorrectly as 7's, ignoring shape boundaries.
 * In train 2, generated fills most of the grid with 7's (e.g., row 0: 7's with 1's; row 4: 1 then 7's; row 9: 6 then mixed but heavy 7's), but expected has patterned 8's inside a shape (e.g., row 1: 7, then two 8's, 7, 1's, etc.; row 4: 1,7, four 8's, etc.)—difference: overfilled internal 8's to 7's (e.g., row 5: generated all 7's except ends, expected has 8's in cols 2-7), turning a partial shape into solid 7's for unknown reason (likely full connectivity assumed).
 * In train 3, generated fills almost everything left of barriers with 7's (e.g., rows 0-3: heavy 7's; row 9: 7's with 1's; row 19: 6 then 7's), but expected has structured 8's in blobs (e.g., row 1: 7's then eight 8's,7,1, etc.; row 9: 7's, eight 8's,1, eight 8's,7)—difference: overfilled large 8-regions (e.g., row 1 generated all 7's in left, expected has 8's in cols 1-10), missing enclosure or outline rules.
 * Function `perform_flood_fill` is helpful for basic propagation but broken for this puzzle as it doesn't limit to enclosed/boundary areas (don't use as-is; modify for depth or boundary detection).
 * No extraction functions tried, but could be useful (e.g., to detect shapes containing 6); current main `program` function integrates well but fails due to overfill.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, mirroring training errors by overfilling with 7's (e.g., rows 0-3: all 7's in cols 0-9 then 1,8; rows 4-5: 7's then 1's and 8; row 11: 6,7, then 1's and 7's)—this creates solid 7-blocks on left, but based on training patterns, expected likely has sparse 7's outlining a shape near the 6 at row 11 col 0 (e.g., horizontal 7's from 6, vertical 7's at edges, leaving internal/external 8's), with barriers of 1's (cols 7-10 in mid-rows) separating fillable areas; overfill ignores potential enclosures around the 1's in row 11, filling areas that should stay 8 (e.g., right-side 8's untouched in expected, but left overfilled).

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs.

 * In train 1, generated fills left columns 0-5 with 7's across most rows (e.g., row 0: first 6 as 7's, then 1, partial 8's with extra 1's), but expected has sparse 7's (e.g., row 0: only first 6 as 7's then 1 and all 8's; rows 1-14: 7 at col 0 and 5, 8's elsewhere; row 15: 6 then 5 7's)—difference: overfilled columns 1-4 and right-side 8's incorrectly as 7's, ignoring shape boundaries.
 * In train 2, generated fills most of the grid with 7's (e.g., row 0: 7's with 1's; row 4: 1 then 7's; row 9: 6 then mixed but heavy 7's), but expected has patterned 8's inside a shape (e.g., row 1: 7, then two 8's, 7, 1's, etc.; row 4: 1,7, four 8's, etc.)—difference: overfilled internal 8's to 7's (e.g., row 5: generated all 7's except ends, expected has 8's in cols 2-7), turning a partial shape into solid 7's for unknown reason (likely full connectivity assumed).
 * In train 3, generated fills almost everything left of barriers with 7's (e.g., rows 0-3: heavy 7's; row 9: 7's with 1's; row 19: 6 then 7's), but expected has structured 8's in blobs (e.g., row 1: 7's then eight 8's,7,1, etc.; row 9: 7's, eight 8's,1, eight 8's,7)—difference: overfilled large 8-regions (e.g., row 1 generated all 7's in left, expected has 8's in cols 1-10), missing enclosure or outline rules.
 * Function `perform_flood_fill` is helpful for basic propagation but broken for this puzzle as it doesn't limit to enclosed/boundary areas (don't use as-is; modify for depth or boundary detection).
 * No extraction functions tried, but could be useful (e.g., to detect shapes containing 6); current main `program` function integrates well but fails due to overfill.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, mirroring training errors by overfilling with 7's (e.g., rows 0-3: all 7's in cols 0-9 then 1,8; rows 4-5: 7's then 1's and 8; row 11: 6,7, then 1's and 7's)—this creates solid 7-blocks on left, but based on training patterns, expected likely has sparse 7's outlining a shape near the 6 at row 11 col 0 (e.g., horizontal 7's from 6, vertical 7's at edges, leaving internal/external 8's), with barriers of 1's (cols 7-10 in mid-rows) separating fillable areas; overfill ignores potential enclosures around the 1's in row 11, filling areas that should stay 8 (e.g., right-side 8's untouched in expected, but left overfilled).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:47:36] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where 1s act as barriers, 6 represents a starting seed (pink), and 8s represent fillable areas within a connected region. The goal is to identify the 4-connected component of non-1 cells (including 6 and 8s) containing the 6, then change the 8s on the "boundary" of this component to 7s while leaving interior 8s as 8 and the 6 unchanged, effectively outlining or highlighting the perimeter of the seed's region.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The connected component is strictly 4-connected (up, down, left, right) for non-1 cells (6 or 8), starting from the 6; diagonal connections do not count for membership in the component.
 * Boundary detection for changing 8 to 7 uses 8-directional neighbors (including diagonals); a cell is on the boundary if any neighbor is out-of-bounds, a 1 (barrier), or a non-1 cell not in the component (e.g., another region's 8 or 6).
 * Interior 8s (fully surrounded by component cells in all 8 directions) must remain 8; overzealous boundary detection can incorrectly mark interior cells as boundary.
 * The 6 itself is never changed, even if on the boundary.
 * Subtle issue: In some cases, the component may have irregular shapes or touch other regions diagonally, which affects 8-direction boundary checks but not 4-connection membership; this can lead to false boundaries if not careful.
 * Barriers (1s) block connectivity, but the output should preserve all 1s unchanged; only 8s in the component are potentially modified to 7.
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected non-1 regions, but only the one containing the 6 is processed; other 8s remain 8.
 * Edge cases include components touching grid edges (out-of-bounds counts as boundary) or narrow corridors where cells might be boundary on multiple sides.
 * No filling or changing outside the component; unchanged areas (e.g., isolated 8s or 1s) stay as-is.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 result: INCORRECT; generated output incorrectly shows 1s in the lower-right area (e.g., rows 12-15 end with 1,1,1,1 or similar) where expected has 8s, suggesting the component failed to include or properly identify interior 8s in an extended region, possibly due to barriers or connectivity misdetection; additionally, some boundary 7s are placed correctly on the left/perimeter, but the right side remains unfilled as 1s instead of interior 8s.
 * Training example 2 result: CORRECT; the boundary detection and component filling worked fully here, likely because the shape was simple without disconnected or diagonally adjacent regions.
 * Training example 3 result: INCORRECT; generated output places too many 7s in interior areas (e.g., row 9 has 7,7 after the main 8s and a 7 after the 1 in position 11, where expected has 8,8,1,8; rows 10-11 have 7s in positions that should be 8s after the 1s), indicating over-detection of boundaries, possibly because 8-direction checks are marking cells as boundary due to diagonal touches to non-component areas or 1s; also, row 9 expected has more 8s around the central 1 (e.g., 8,8,1,8 vs generated 7,7,1,7).
 * The main program composes the above functions correctly for copying the grid and only modifying 8s to 7s on boundaries, but fails when components have complex shapes involving 1s or other regions nearby.
 * find_start_position is helpful and correct for locating the 6.
 * find_connected_component is helpful but may miss subtle connectivity if input has isolated 8s that should be included (though based on 4-connected non-1, it seems accurate; issue likely in boundary step).
 * is_boundary is helpful in concept but overly sensitive in 8-directions, leading to false positives for interior cells adjacent diagonally to 1s or external non-1s.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though is_boundary needs tuning (e.g., perhaps stricter conditions or 4-direction boundary check).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a reasonable outline of 7s around what appears to be a central component containing the 6 at bottom-left (row 11, col 0), with 7s on perimeters and 8s interior, but it includes unexpected 7s in potentially interior spots (e.g., row 3 has 7,7,7 at end before 1,8 which might be over-boundary detection similar to training 3; row 7 has 7,7,1,1,1,8 suggesting incomplete filling).
 * It does not look fully correct because it mirrors issues from training 1 and 3: possible failure to extend the component fully (e.g., the rightmost column has many 8s unchanged, but if they are part of the component, some should be 7s on boundary; row 11 has 6,7,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1,1,1 which preserves 1s but may not outline properly if 1s are internal barriers).
 * The output makes partial sense for a boundary-filling puzzle (e.g., top rows have solid 7s on left, transitioning to 8s), but likely incorrect due to inconsistent boundary marking—e.g., row 1 has 8s extending right but ends with 7,1,8, which might miss interior 8s or overmark near 1s; without exact input, it seems to under-fill some areas (like training 1's right side) and over-fill others (like training 3's interiors).
 * To handle the test case, ensure component includes all 4-connected non-1s from 6, and refine boundary to avoid diagonal sensitivity; the 1s in row 11 suggest internal barriers that should not trigger extra 7s nearby.
