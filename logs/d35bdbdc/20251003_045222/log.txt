=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 04:52:22] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 05:02:08] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle involving 3x3 "sandwich" patterns, where each sandwich consists of a uniform border value A surrounding a center value B, and sandwiches can form directed chains when the B of one matches the A of another. The goal is to process these chains starting from root sandwiches (those with no incoming links), updating the center of each sandwich in the chain to the B of the next one while clearing the cells of the subsequent sandwiches, resulting in a modified grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Sandwiches are strictly 3x3 and positioned such that the top-left is at (r,c) where r and c range from 0 to n-3; the border consists of exactly 8 specific cells (top row all three, middle row first and third, bottom row all three except possibly adjusted, but code uses explicit positions: (r,c),(r,c+1),(r,c+2),(r+1,c),(r+1,c+2),(r+2,c),(r+2,c+1),(r+2,c+2)), all must equal A (non-zero), center (r+1,c+1) must be B (non-zero, !=A).
 * Chains are formed by linking sandwich S1 to S2 if S1.B == S2.A; the code assumes at most one sandwich per starting A value (overwrites in color_to_sand dict), which could miss multiples or create incorrect links if duplicates exist.
 * Processing only occurs on root chains (sandwiches with no incoming links); for a chain, set current center to next.B, then clear the entire 3x3 of the next sandwich (sets all 9 cells to 0), and recurse on the remainder of the chain— this effectively "propagates" values along the chain while removing overlapped or linked sandwiches.
 * Grid is n x n (assumed square), and modifications are in-place on a copy; untouched cells remain as-is.
 * Subtlety: Detection skips if center==0 or borders not uniform/non-zero; chains may overlap in positions, but clearing happens after linking, potentially erasing partial sandwiches not yet detected.
 * Easy to miss: Only detects sandwiches where all 8 border positions match exactly; no rotation or irregular shapes; assumes A and B are integers representing "colors" or values.
 * Chains are acyclic (code doesn't check, but recursion assumes no cycles); multiple roots possible, processed independently.
 * After processing, the final grid should have chain-start centers updated to the end-of-chain B, intermediates cleared, and non-chain elements intact— this might leave isolated sandwiches uncleared if they have incoming but no root path.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class Sandwich:
    def __init__(self, r: int, c: int, A: int, B: int):
        self.r = r
        self.c = c
        self.A = A
        self.B = B
        self.center_r = r + 1
        self.center_c = c + 1
        self.next = None
```
(This class represents a detected 3x3 sandwich, storing position, values, and chain link; useful for building and traversing chains.)

```python
def clear_sandwich(grid: List[List[int]], s: Sandwich):
    for dr in range(3):
        for dc in range(3):
            grid[s.r + dr][s.c + dc] = 0
```
(This function erases a full 3x3 sandwich area to 0; essential for removing processed linked sandwiches.)

```python
def process_chain(grid: List[List[int]], current: Sandwich):
    if current is None:
        return
    if current.next is None:
        clear_sandwich(grid, current)
        return
    next_s = current.next
    grid[current.center_r][current.center_c] = next_s.B
    clear_sandwich(grid, next_s)
    process_chain(grid, next_s.next)
```
(This recursive function handles chain processing: updates current center to next's B if chain continues, clears the next sandwich, and recurses; for terminals, it clears the last sandwich. Key for propagating values and cleanup, but note it clears the last one entirely, which might not be intended if terminals should remain.)

```python
# Detection logic in program() is helpful for extracting sandwiches:
# Loops over possible top-left (r,c), checks 8 border positions all == A (from first border), center B !=0/A, stores in list and dict by A.
# Then links via next = color_to_sand[B], builds incoming defaultdict(list) for roots = [s for s in sandwiches if not incoming[s]].
```
(This extraction and chaining logic is core; uses defaultdict for incoming degrees to find roots efficiently.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly detects sandwiches based on uniform borders and non-zero center, forms chains via B-to-A matching, identifies roots, and processes by updating centers and clearing linked sandwiches— this worked perfectly for all three training examples, producing correct outputs.
 * What worked: Full 3x3 clearing and center propagation along chains; handling multiple roots; assuming unique A per sandwich didn't break training cases.
 * What didn't work: Unknown if test output is fully correct without expected result, but the generated test output shows partial clearing (e.g., some 2s,3s,5s remain or are updated, areas like bottom-right cleared to 0s) and updates (e.g., possible center changes visible in scattered positions), but it leaves some potential sandwiches uncleared (e.g., row 6-8 col 7-9 has 3s that might be a sandwich not processed), suggesting possible missed chains or overlaps; also, top rows have isolated 2s/4s that weren't cleared, which might be correct if not sandwiches but could indicate incomplete detection if borders aren't strictly checked.
 * The color_to_sand dict overwrites if multiple sandwiches share A, potentially breaking chains in cases with duplicate As (not an issue in training, but subtle risk for test).
 * process_chain clears the terminal sandwich entirely (sets its center to 0 after possible prior update), but if terminals should retain their B, this might over-clear— unclear from training, but test output has lingering values like 5s/3s that could be affected.
 * No cycle detection in chaining/recursion, but assuming acyclic from puzzle rules.
 * The explicit border positions in detection are helpful and match the irregular sandwich shape (not full 3x3 border, missing middle-center-left/right? Wait, positions skip (r+1,c+1) which is center, but include (r+1,c) and (r+1,c+2), so it's like a plus-sign border missing the very center sides? No, it's standard 8-around-center.
 * Overall, extraction of sandwiches and root-finding via incoming degrees is essential and correct; no unhelpful functions here—all provided are relevant, though clear_sandwich is aggressive (clears full 3x3 even if partial overlap).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It shows clearing in areas like row 0-4 col 7-9 (many 0s where 2/3/5 were possibly), updates like row 2 col 2=2 (possible center prop), and remnants like bottom 5s/3s/7s/1s/9s, suggesting chains were processed (e.g., a chain ending in 5 or 3 cleared intermediates but left roots updated).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several potential sandwiches remain uncleared, e.g., row 6-8 col 0-2 has 7/1/7 pattern that might be a border A=7 with center? but positions don't match exactly, and row 7-9 col 8-10 (edge) has 3s uncleared; also, isolated 4s in row 2/3 col 1/2 suggest a missed short chain or non-sandwich; top-right 2s in row 1/2 col 6-8 look like partial border not processed, indicating possible detection failure for edge/overlapping sandwiches or incorrect linking (e.g., if multiple As conflicted). Without expected output, it's hard to confirm, but the output differs from a "fully processed" grid by leaving more non-zero clusters than expected, possibly over-clearing some areas (e.g., row 8-9 col 1-5 all 5s/0s mixed) while under-processing others—note that it IS different from a clean/cleared grid, even if puzzle allows remnants.

[2025-10-03 05:02:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 05:25:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 10x10 grid of non-negative integers representing colored regions or blobs, where the goal is to process the grid by identifying connected components (likely 4-way adjacency) of the same number and modifying the grid based on whether those components touch the grid's border, ultimately producing a transformed output grid that matches specific expected patterns. The transformation appears to involve more than simple removal to 0, as expected outputs introduce or reassign new numbers (e.g., 2, 5, 9) in certain positions, suggesting rules for filling, relabeling, or preserving/modifying enclosed vs. border-touching regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right), as the code uses those directions; diagonal connections are not considered.
 * Border touching must account for all four sides (top row i==0, bottom row i==n-1, left column j==0, right column j==n-1); the current code only checks left and right (y==0 or y==n-1), missing top/bottom, which causes incorrect preservation/removal of components that touch only top or bottom.
 * The puzzle is not purely about setting non-border-touching components to 0 (removal/erasure), as expected outputs retain some original numbers but introduce new ones (e.g., in Training 1, new 5-blob on left and a 2 in the 3-region; in Training 2, new 5's and a 2 in the 8-region; in Training 3, new 9 in 1-region, scattered 5's, and 3 in 7-region), implying rules for relabeling enclosed areas, filling "holes" with new identifiers, or merging/expanding regions based on enclosure.
 * Enclosed regions (non-border-touching) may need to be filled or reassigned a new color/number rather than erased, while border-touching regions are preserved but possibly modified (e.g., holes filled or parts relabeled).
 * Grids may have pre-existing 0's (empty/blank cells) that act as separators or holes within blobs; the code visits only non-zero cells but doesn't explicitly handle filling internal 0's.
 * Components are processed in discovery order (row-major), which may affect relabeling if new numbers are assigned sequentially or based on position.
 * Subtle element: New numbers in expected outputs seem to form their own connected structures (e.g., 5's in Training 1 form a border-touching blob), suggesting the puzzle simulates "growing" or "infecting" enclosed areas from borders or applying a labeling scheme like Union-Find for regions.
 * All cells start as input values; output must exactly match expected, including positions of 0's and new/old numbers—no over-removal or incorrect preservation.
 * Potential for multiple components of the same color; each must be treated independently.
 * n=10 fixed size, but code handles general n.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current DFS-based component extraction is helpful for identifying connected same-color regions and checking properties like border touch; it can be reused/modified for relabeling instead of just zeroing.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_component(grid: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], bool]:
    """
    DFS to extract a connected component of given color starting from (start_i, start_j),
    returning the list of cells and whether it touches any border (all 4 sides).
    Assumes grid is not modified; uses a temp visited.
    """
    n = len(grid)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    component = []
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    touches_border = False
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        if visited[x][y] or grid[x][y] != color:
            continue
        visited[x][y] = True
        component.append((x, y))
        # Check all 4 borders
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1 or y == 0 or y == n - 1:
            touches_border = True
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == color:
                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return component, touches_border
```

No types like classes are needed yet, but could add a Component dataclass for cells and properties if relabeling logic grows complex.

The main program function is somewhat helpful as a skeleton (copies grid, iterates over cells, processes components), but its zeroing logic is incorrect/unhelpful for this puzzle—do not reuse the removal part; adapt for conditional relabeling (e.g., if not touches_border, assign new color like next available number).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements connected component detection via DFS/stack, avoiding recursion limits for n=10, and collects components properly, which is essential for analyzing enclosure.
 * Missed full border check: Only detects left/right touches (y==0 or y==n-1), so components touching only top/bottom are incorrectly preserved as if border-touching; this likely causes over-preservation in all training examples (e.g., in Training 1, 3's and 6's kept intact with internal 0's, but expected modifies with 5's and 2).
 * Fundamentally missed the relabeling/filling mechanic: Sets non-border components to 0 (erasure), but expected outputs introduce new numbers forming structured blobs (e.g., Training 1 generated keeps original 3's/6's with some internal 0's like [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3] in row 1, but expected has [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,3,2,3] with new 5-blob and 2 replacement; difference unknown but clearly not erasure—possibly enclosed areas filled from adjacent border regions or assigned sequential IDs).
 * In Training 2, generated preserves 2's and 8's/1's with internal 0's (e.g., [2,0,2,...]), but expected has mostly 0's in top, new 5's scattered/enclosed, and 2 inserted in 8-region ([8,2,8,...]); generated mismatches by not removing border-touching blobs and not creating new structures.
 * In Training 3, generated keeps 1's, 4's, 2's, 7's with internal 0's (e.g., [1,0,1,...]), but expected removes/modifies top 1's/4's to 0's, adds 9/5's in scattered positions, and inserts 3 in 7's; generated over-preserves and doesn't relabel.
 * The visited matrix prevents reprocessing cells, which works, but iteration order (row-major) may matter if new labels depend on discovery.
 * No handling of internal 0's as potential "enclosable" spaces; code skips 0's, but expected may fill them (e.g., Training 1 expected fills left/middle with 5's where generated has 0's).
 * Function for component finding is helpful and not broken (can be fixed for borders/relabeling); the overall program logic is partially relevant but the zeroing is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle—avoid erasure in future, focus on conditional assignment of new colors (e.g., increment a counter for enclosed regions).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it erases almost the entire grid to 0's (only partial 3's in rows 6-7 right side and a lone 7 in row 7 left), suggesting over-removal of most components, likely because few touch left/right borders due to the code's bug— but expected likely preserves/modifies border-touching structures (e.g., the 3's may touch top/bottom and need keeping/relabeling, and the 7 may be part of a larger relabeled blob).
 * Differences: Generated has isolated remnants (e.g., [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3] in row 6, but with 0's elsewhere), implying incomplete removal or wrong border detection; correct output should match expected patterns seen in training (e.g., new blob formations like 5's), not near-total erasure—possibly the test has enclosed 3's/7 that need relabeling to a new number rather than 0, or border-touching parts expanded.
 * The output makes little sense for a "visual puzzle" as it destroys most structure, unlike training expecteds which retain/modify visually coherent blobs; account for full 4-side borders and relabeling logic (e.g., assign enclosed components a new unique number starting from max+1) to handle test case without over-erasing.

[2025-10-03 05:25:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 10x10 grid of non-negative integers representing colored regions or blobs, where the goal is to process the grid by identifying connected components (likely 4-way adjacency) of the same number and modifying the grid based on whether those components touch the grid's border, ultimately producing a transformed output grid that matches specific expected patterns. The transformation appears to involve more than simple removal to 0, as expected outputs introduce or reassign new numbers (e.g., 2, 5, 9) in certain positions, suggesting rules for filling, relabeling, or preserving/modifying enclosed vs. border-touching regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right), as the code uses those directions; diagonal connections are not considered.
 * Border touching must account for all four sides (top row i==0, bottom row i==n-1, left column j==0, right column j==n-1); the current code only checks left and right (y==0 or y==n-1), missing top/bottom, which causes incorrect preservation/removal of components that touch only top or bottom.
 * The puzzle is not purely about setting non-border-touching components to 0 (removal/erasure), as expected outputs retain some original numbers but introduce new ones (e.g., in Training 1, new 5-blob on left and a 2 in the 3-region; in Training 2, new 5's and a 2 in the 8-region; in Training 3, new 9 in 1-region, scattered 5's, and 3 in 7-region), implying rules for relabeling enclosed areas, filling "holes" with new identifiers, or merging/expanding regions based on enclosure.
 * Enclosed regions (non-border-touching) may need to be filled or reassigned a new color/number rather than erased, while border-touching regions are preserved but possibly modified (e.g., holes filled or parts relabeled).
 * Grids may have pre-existing 0's (empty/blank cells) that act as separators or holes within blobs; the code visits only non-zero cells but doesn't explicitly handle filling internal 0's.
 * Components are processed in discovery order (row-major), which may affect relabeling if new numbers are assigned sequentially or based on position.
 * Subtle element: New numbers in expected outputs seem to form their own connected structures (e.g., 5's in Training 1 form a border-touching blob), suggesting the puzzle simulates "growing" or "infecting" enclosed areas from borders or applying a labeling scheme like Union-Find for regions.
 * All cells start as input values; output must exactly match expected, including positions of 0's and new/old numbers—no over-removal or incorrect preservation.
 * Potential for multiple components of the same color; each must be treated independently.
 * n=10 fixed size, but code handles general n.

    n = len(grid)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    component = []

    touches_border = False
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        if visited[x][y] or grid[x][y] != color:
            continue
        visited[x][y] = True
        component.append((x, y))
        # Check all 4 borders
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1 or y == 0 or y == n - 1:
            touches_border = True
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == color:

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle involving 3x3 "sandwich" patterns, where each sandwich consists of a uniform border value A surrounding a center value B, and sandwiches can form directed chains when the B of one matches the A of another. The goal is to process these chains starting from root sandwiches (those with no incoming links), updating the center of each sandwich in the chain to the B of the next one while clearing the cells of the subsequent sandwiches, resulting in a modified grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Sandwiches are strictly 3x3 and positioned such that the top-left is at (r,c) where r and c range from 0 to n-3; the border consists of exactly 8 specific cells (top row all three, middle row first and third, bottom row all three except possibly adjusted, but code uses explicit positions: (r,c),(r,c+1),(r,c+2),(r+1,c),(r+1,c+2),(r+2,c),(r+2,c+1),(r+2,c+2)), all must equal A (non-zero), center (r+1,c+1) must be B (non-zero, !=A).
 * Chains are formed by linking sandwich S1 to S2 if S1.B == S2.A; the code assumes at most one sandwich per starting A value (overwrites in color_to_sand dict), which could miss multiples or create incorrect links if duplicates exist.
 * Processing only occurs on root chains (sandwiches with no incoming links); for a chain, set current center to next.B, then clear the entire 3x3 of the next sandwich (sets all 9 cells to 0), and recurse on the remainder of the chain— this effectively "propagates" values along the chain while removing overlapped or linked sandwiches.
 * Grid is n x n (assumed square), and modifications are in-place on a copy; untouched cells remain as-is.
 * Subtlety: Detection skips if center==0 or borders not uniform/non-zero; chains may overlap in positions, but clearing happens after linking, potentially erasing partial sandwiches not yet detected.
 * Easy to miss: Only detects sandwiches where all 8 border positions match exactly; no rotation or irregular shapes; assumes A and B are integers representing "colors" or values.
 * Chains are acyclic (code doesn't check, but recursion assumes no cycles); multiple roots possible, processed independently.
 * After processing, the final grid should have chain-start centers updated to the end-of-chain B, intermediates cleared, and non-chain elements intact— this might leave isolated sandwiches uncleared if they have incoming but no root path.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class Sandwich:
    def __init__(self, r: int, c: int, A: int, B: int):
        self.r = r
        self.c = c
        self.A = A
        self.B = B
        self.center_r = r + 1
        self.center_c = c + 1
        self.next = None
```
(This class represents a detected 3x3 sandwich, storing position, values, and chain link; useful for building and traversing chains.)

```python
def clear_sandwich(grid: List[List[int]], s: Sandwich):
    for dr in range(3):
        for dc in range(3):
            grid[s.r + dr][s.c + dc] = 0
```
(This function erases a full 3x3 sandwich area to 0; essential for removing processed linked sandwiches.)

```python
def process_chain(grid: List[List[int]], current: Sandwich):
    if current is None:
        return
    if current.next is None:
        clear_sandwich(grid, current)
        return
    next_s = current.next
    grid[current.center_r][current.center_c] = next_s.B
    clear_sandwich(grid, next_s)
    process_chain(grid, next_s.next)
```
(This recursive function handles chain processing: updates current center to next's B if chain continues, clears the next sandwich, and recurses; for terminals, it clears the last sandwich. Key for propagating values and cleanup, but note it clears the last one entirely, which might not be intended if terminals should remain.)

```python
# Detection logic in program() is helpful for extracting sandwiches:
# Loops over possible top-left (r,c), checks 8 border positions all == A (from first border), center B !=0/A, stores in list and dict by A.
# Then links via next = color_to_sand[B], builds incoming defaultdict(list) for roots = [s for s in sandwiches if not incoming[s]].
```
(This extraction and chaining logic is core; uses defaultdict for incoming degrees to find roots efficiently.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly detects sandwiches based on uniform borders and non-zero center, forms chains via B-to-A matching, identifies roots, and processes by updating centers and clearing linked sandwiches— this worked perfectly for all three training examples, producing correct outputs.
 * What worked: Full 3x3 clearing and center propagation along chains; handling multiple roots; assuming unique A per sandwich didn't break training cases.
 * What didn't work: Unknown if test output is fully correct without expected result, but the generated test output shows partial clearing (e.g., some 2s,3s,5s remain or are updated, areas like bottom-right cleared to 0s) and updates (e.g., possible center changes visible in scattered positions), but it leaves some potential sandwiches uncleared (e.g., row 6-8 col 7-9 has 3s that might be a sandwich not processed), suggesting possible missed chains or overlaps; also, top rows have isolated 2s/4s that weren't cleared, which might be correct if not sandwiches but could indicate incomplete detection if borders aren't strictly checked.
 * The color_to_sand dict overwrites if multiple sandwiches share A, potentially breaking chains in cases with duplicate As (not an issue in training, but subtle risk for test).
 * process_chain clears the terminal sandwich entirely (sets its center to 0 after possible prior update), but if terminals should retain their B, this might over-clear— unclear from training, but test output has lingering values like 5s/3s that could be affected.
 * No cycle detection in chaining/recursion, but assuming acyclic from puzzle rules.
 * The explicit border positions in detection are helpful and match the irregular sandwich shape (not full 3x3 border, missing middle-center-left/right? Wait, positions skip (r+1,c+1) which is center, but include (r+1,c) and (r+1,c+2), so it's like a plus-sign border missing the very center sides? No, it's standard 8-around-center.
 * Overall, extraction of sandwiches and root-finding via incoming degrees is essential and correct; no unhelpful functions here—all provided are relevant, though clear_sandwich is aggressive (clears full 3x3 even if partial overlap).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It shows clearing in areas like row 0-4 col 7-9 (many 0s where 2/3/5 were possibly), updates like row 2 col 2=2 (possible center prop), and remnants like bottom 5s/3s/7s/1s/9s, suggesting chains were processed (e.g., a chain ending in 5 or 3 cleared intermediates but left roots updated).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several potential sandwiches remain uncleared, e.g., row 6-8 col 0-2 has 7/1/7 pattern that might be a border A=7 with center? but positions don't match exactly, and row 7-9 col 8-10 (edge) has 3s uncleared; also, isolated 4s in row 2/3 col 1/2 suggest a missed short chain or non-sandwich; top-right 2s in row 1/2 col 6-8 look like partial border not processed, indicating possible detection failure for edge/overlapping sandwiches or incorrect linking (e.g., if multiple As conflicted). Without expected output, it's hard to confirm, but the output differs from a "fully processed" grid by leaving more non-zero clusters than expected, possibly over-clearing some areas (e.g., row 8-9 col 1-5 all 5s/0s mixed) while under-processing others—note that it IS different from a clean/cleared grid, even if puzzle allows remnants.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 05:34:08] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based logic puzzle involving "sandwich" patterns, where 3x3 blocks with uniform non-zero border values (A) and a different non-zero center value (B) are detected and chained together based on B matching the A of a subsequent sandwich. The goal is to process chains starting from root sandwiches (those with no predecessors), updating the grid by placing the next sandwich's B into the current center and clearing the next sandwich's entire 3x3 area, ultimately simplifying or solving the grid through these operations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Sandwiches are strictly 3x3 blocks; borders consist of the 8 perimeter cells (excluding center), all must match A (non-zero), and center must be B (non-zero and != A); inner cells or partial matches do not qualify.
 * Chaining links a sandwich's B to the closest (Manhattan distance from centers) subsequent sandwich with matching A; if no match, next is None; multiple predecessors possible, but roots have zero incoming links.
 * Processing only occurs on chains from roots; for a chain, recursively set current center to next's B, then clear the entire 3x3 of the next sandwich (sets all 9 cells to 0), but do not clear the current one unless it's a leaf (no next).
 * Overlaps between sandwiches must be handled carefully, as clearing one may affect detection or linking of others; detection happens before any clearing, so all sandwiches are found on the initial grid.
 * Grid size is variable (e.g., 10x10 in test), but sandwiches only scanned up to n-2 to fit 3x3; borders can overlap, but uniform A check is per sandwich independently.
 * Subtle: Closest candidate breaks ties by first-found min distance; no directionality beyond closeness; chains are linear (one next per sandwich), but graph may have branches via multiple incoming.
 * Leaves (no next) are fully cleared; non-leaves have center updated but not fully cleared, allowing propagation of values backward in the chain.
 * Potential issues: If chains cycle (unlikely, as B != A prevents self-loops, but possible via multiples), but code assumes DAG; clearing may leave zeros that could mimic empty areas but doesn't re-detect.
 * All operations are in-place on a copy of the grid; final output is the modified grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating correct detection, chaining, rooting, and processing for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * What worked: Uniform border detection skips zeros/inconsistencies properly; closest linking uses Manhattan distance correctly; chain processing propagates B values backward and clears appropriately without re-detection issues in training.
 * What didn't work: Fails on test input, likely due to complex overlaps, multiple candidates, or chain configurations where clearing affects implicit dependencies not captured pre-detection; for example, if sandwiches overlap, pre-clearing detection misses dynamic changes.
 * The `Sandwich` class is essential for encapsulating positions, values, and links, enabling graph-like processing.
 * `detect_sandwiches` is core and correct, as it handles border uniformity without including center; unhelpful if grid has non-3x3 patterns, but puzzle seems fixed to 3x3.
 * `assign_nexts` and `get_closest` are helpful for chaining but may fail subtly if multiple equidistant candidates (code picks first, which might not be intended if puzzle prefers specific direction like down/right).
 * `find_roots` correctly builds incoming graph; no cycles assumed, which holds since A != B prevents loops.
 * `process_chain` and `clear_sandwich` work for linear chains but may not handle branches (multiple incoming to one node) fully, as roots process independently but shared nodes could be cleared multiple times (though idempotent via zeros).
 * `program` orchestrates well but detects all upfront, which is good for isolation but misses if puzzle requires iterative detection post-clearing (unknown, but training passed without it).
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet; all provided are relevant, though `get_closest` could be enhanced for tie-breaking (e.g., by row-major order).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x10 grid with many zeros introduced and some values relocated (e.g., 2s, 3s, 5s moved or cleared in positions like row 1 cols 6-8, row 2 col 8, row 7 cols 7-9), but it does not appear fully correct as it leaves residual non-zero values in potentially uncleared areas (e.g., row 7 has 7,1,7; row 8 has 7,1,7) and isolated numbers like 9 in row 6 col 4, suggesting incomplete chain processing or missed sandwiches.
 * Expected output should have more comprehensive clearing of chained sandwiches and precise B placements in centers, likely resulting in fewer scattered numbers (e.g., propagating 5s or 3s further); the output has partial chains resolved (e.g., some 2s cleared around row 1-2) but others untouched (e.g., bottom 5s and 7s persist), indicating the closest-linking or rooting missed a key chain, perhaps due to distance calculation overlooking overlaps.
 * The output differs from expected by not fully simplifying the grid—visually, it looks like only some upper/mid chains were processed (e.g., 4s and 2s partially handled), while lower sections (rows 6-9 with 1,3,5,7,9) remain dense, possibly because roots were incorrectly identified or no next assigned for certain B values like 9 or 7.
 * It is different from expected for unknown reasons in chaining (e.g., maybe puzzle prefers nearest in a specific direction, not pure Manhattan), but the partial clearing shows core detection works; to handle test, update linking to consider only unprocessed candidates or iterate detection post-clear.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 05:34:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 10x10 grid of non-negative integers representing colored regions or blobs, where the goal is to process the grid by identifying connected components (likely 4-way adjacency) of the same number and modifying the grid based on whether those components touch the grid's border, ultimately producing a transformed output grid that matches specific expected patterns. The transformation appears to involve more than simple removal to 0, as expected outputs introduce or reassign new numbers (e.g., 2, 5, 9) in certain positions, suggesting rules for filling, relabeling, or preserving/modifying enclosed vs. border-touching regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right), as the code uses those directions; diagonal connections are not considered.
 * Border touching must account for all four sides (top row i==0, bottom row i==n-1, left column j==0, right column j==n-1); the current code only checks left and right (y==0 or y==n-1), missing top/bottom, which causes incorrect preservation/removal of components that touch only top or bottom.
 * The puzzle is not purely about setting non-border-touching components to 0 (removal/erasure), as expected outputs retain some original numbers but introduce new ones (e.g., in Training 1, new 5-blob on left and a 2 in the 3-region; in Training 2, new 5's and a 2 in the 8-region; in Training 3, new 9 in 1-region, scattered 5's, and 3 in 7-region), implying rules for relabeling enclosed areas, filling "holes" with new identifiers, or merging/expanding regions based on enclosure.
 * Enclosed regions (non-border-touching) may need to be filled or reassigned a new color/number rather than erased, while border-touching regions are preserved but possibly modified (e.g., holes filled or parts relabeled).
 * Grids may have pre-existing 0's (empty/blank cells) that act as separators or holes within blobs; the code visits only non-zero cells but doesn't explicitly handle filling internal 0's.
 * Components are processed in discovery order (row-major), which may affect relabeling if new numbers are assigned sequentially or based on position.
 * Subtle element: New numbers in expected outputs seem to form their own connected structures (e.g., 5's in Training 1 form a border-touching blob), suggesting the puzzle simulates "growing" or "infecting" enclosed areas from borders or applying a labeling scheme like Union-Find for regions.
 * All cells start as input values; output must exactly match expected, including positions of 0's and new/old numbers—no over-removal or incorrect preservation.
 * Potential for multiple components of the same color; each must be treated independently.
 * n=10 fixed size, but code handles general n.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current DFS-based component extraction is helpful for identifying connected same-color regions and checking properties like border touch; it can be reused/modified for relabeling instead of just zeroing.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_component(grid: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], bool]:
    """
    DFS to extract a connected component of given color starting from (start_i, start_j),
    returning the list of cells and whether it touches any border (all 4 sides).
    Assumes grid is not modified; uses a temp visited.
    """
    n = len(grid)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    component = []
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    touches_border = False
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        if visited[x][y] or grid[x][y] != color:
            continue
        visited[x][y] = True
        component.append((x, y))
        # Check all 4 borders
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1 or y == 0 or y == n - 1:
            touches_border = True
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == color:
                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return component, touches_border
```

No types like classes are needed yet, but could add a Component dataclass for cells and properties if relabeling logic grows complex.

The main program function is somewhat helpful as a skeleton (copies grid, iterates over cells, processes components), but its zeroing logic is incorrect/unhelpful for this puzzle—do not reuse the removal part; adapt for conditional relabeling (e.g., if not touches_border, assign new color like next available number).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements connected component detection via DFS/stack, avoiding recursion limits for n=10, and collects components properly, which is essential for analyzing enclosure.
 * Missed full border check: Only detects left/right touches (y==0 or y==n-1), so components touching only top/bottom are incorrectly preserved as if border-touching; this likely causes over-preservation in all training examples (e.g., in Training 1, 3's and 6's kept intact with internal 0's, but expected modifies with 5's and 2).
 * Fundamentally missed the relabeling/filling mechanic: Sets non-border components to 0 (erasure), but expected outputs introduce new numbers forming structured blobs (e.g., Training 1 generated keeps original 3's/6's with some internal 0's like [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3] in row 1, but expected has [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,3,2,3] with new 5-blob and 2 replacement; difference unknown but clearly not erasure—possibly enclosed areas filled from adjacent border regions or assigned sequential IDs).
 * In Training 2, generated preserves 2's and 8's/1's with internal 0's (e.g., [2,0,2,...]), but expected has mostly 0's in top, new 5's scattered/enclosed, and 2 inserted in 8-region ([8,2,8,...]); generated mismatches by not removing border-touching blobs and not creating new structures.
 * In Training 3, generated keeps 1's, 4's, 2's, 7's with internal 0's (e.g., [1,0,1,...]), but expected removes/modifies top 1's/4's to 0's, adds 9/5's in scattered positions, and inserts 3 in 7's; generated over-preserves and doesn't relabel.
 * The visited matrix prevents reprocessing cells, which works, but iteration order (row-major) may matter if new labels depend on discovery.
 * No handling of internal 0's as potential "enclosable" spaces; code skips 0's, but expected may fill them (e.g., Training 1 expected fills left/middle with 5's where generated has 0's).
 * Function for component finding is helpful and not broken (can be fixed for borders/relabeling); the overall program logic is partially relevant but the zeroing is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle—avoid erasure in future, focus on conditional assignment of new colors (e.g., increment a counter for enclosed regions).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it erases almost the entire grid to 0's (only partial 3's in rows 6-7 right side and a lone 7 in row 7 left), suggesting over-removal of most components, likely because few touch left/right borders due to the code's bug— but expected likely preserves/modifies border-touching structures (e.g., the 3's may touch top/bottom and need keeping/relabeling, and the 7 may be part of a larger relabeled blob).
 * Differences: Generated has isolated remnants (e.g., [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3] in row 6, but with 0's elsewhere), implying incomplete removal or wrong border detection; correct output should match expected patterns seen in training (e.g., new blob formations like 5's), not near-total erasure—possibly the test has enclosed 3's/7 that need relabeling to a new number rather than 0, or border-touching parts expanded.
 * The output makes little sense for a "visual puzzle" as it destroys most structure, unlike training expecteds which retain/modify visually coherent blobs; account for full 4-side borders and relabeling logic (e.g., assign enclosed components a new unique number starting from max+1) to handle test case without over-erasing.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle involving 3x3 "sandwich" patterns, where each sandwich consists of a uniform border value A surrounding a center value B, and sandwiches can form directed chains when the B of one matches the A of another. The goal is to process these chains starting from root sandwiches (those with no incoming links), updating the center of each sandwich in the chain to the B of the next one while clearing the cells of the subsequent sandwiches, resulting in a modified grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Sandwiches are strictly 3x3 and positioned such that the top-left is at (r,c) where r and c range from 0 to n-3; the border consists of exactly 8 specific cells (top row all three, middle row first and third, bottom row all three except possibly adjusted, but code uses explicit positions: (r,c),(r,c+1),(r,c+2),(r+1,c),(r+1,c+2),(r+2,c),(r+2,c+1),(r+2,c+2)), all must equal A (non-zero), center (r+1,c+1) must be B (non-zero, !=A).
 * Chains are formed by linking sandwich S1 to S2 if S1.B == S2.A; the code assumes at most one sandwich per starting A value (overwrites in color_to_sand dict), which could miss multiples or create incorrect links if duplicates exist.
 * Processing only occurs on root chains (sandwiches with no incoming links); for a chain, set current center to next.B, then clear the entire 3x3 of the next sandwich (sets all 9 cells to 0), and recurse on the remainder of the chain— this effectively "propagates" values along the chain while removing overlapped or linked sandwiches.
 * Grid is n x n (assumed square), and modifications are in-place on a copy; untouched cells remain as-is.
 * Subtlety: Detection skips if center==0 or borders not uniform/non-zero; chains may overlap in positions, but clearing happens after linking, potentially erasing partial sandwiches not yet detected.
 * Easy to miss: Only detects sandwiches where all 8 border positions match exactly; no rotation or irregular shapes; assumes A and B are integers representing "colors" or values.
 * Chains are acyclic (code doesn't check, but recursion assumes no cycles); multiple roots possible, processed independently.
 * After processing, the final grid should have chain-start centers updated to the end-of-chain B, intermediates cleared, and non-chain elements intact— this might leave isolated sandwiches uncleared if they have incoming but no root path.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class Sandwich:
    def __init__(self, r: int, c: int, A: int, B: int):
        self.r = r
        self.c = c
        self.A = A
        self.B = B
        self.center_r = r + 1
        self.center_c = c + 1
        self.next = None
```
(This class represents a detected 3x3 sandwich, storing position, values, and chain link; useful for building and traversing chains.)

```python
def clear_sandwich(grid: List[List[int]], s: Sandwich):
    for dr in range(3):
        for dc in range(3):
            grid[s.r + dr][s.c + dc] = 0
```
(This function erases a full 3x3 sandwich area to 0; essential for removing processed linked sandwiches.)

```python
def process_chain(grid: List[List[int]], current: Sandwich):
    if current is None:
        return
    if current.next is None:
        clear_sandwich(grid, current)
        return
    next_s = current.next
    grid[current.center_r][current.center_c] = next_s.B
    clear_sandwich(grid, next_s)
    process_chain(grid, next_s.next)
```
(This recursive function handles chain processing: updates current center to next's B if chain continues, clears the next sandwich, and recurses; for terminals, it clears the last sandwich. Key for propagating values and cleanup, but note it clears the last one entirely, which might not be intended if terminals should remain.)

```python
# Detection logic in program() is helpful for extracting sandwiches:
# Loops over possible top-left (r,c), checks 8 border positions all == A (from first border), center B !=0/A, stores in list and dict by A.
# Then links via next = color_to_sand[B], builds incoming defaultdict(list) for roots = [s for s in sandwiches if not incoming[s]].
```
(This extraction and chaining logic is core; uses defaultdict for incoming degrees to find roots efficiently.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly detects sandwiches based on uniform borders and non-zero center, forms chains via B-to-A matching, identifies roots, and processes by updating centers and clearing linked sandwiches— this worked perfectly for all three training examples, producing correct outputs.
 * What worked: Full 3x3 clearing and center propagation along chains; handling multiple roots; assuming unique A per sandwich didn't break training cases.
 * What didn't work: Unknown if test output is fully correct without expected result, but the generated test output shows partial clearing (e.g., some 2s,3s,5s remain or are updated, areas like bottom-right cleared to 0s) and updates (e.g., possible center changes visible in scattered positions), but it leaves some potential sandwiches uncleared (e.g., row 6-8 col 7-9 has 3s that might be a sandwich not processed), suggesting possible missed chains or overlaps; also, top rows have isolated 2s/4s that weren't cleared, which might be correct if not sandwiches but could indicate incomplete detection if borders aren't strictly checked.
 * The color_to_sand dict overwrites if multiple sandwiches share A, potentially breaking chains in cases with duplicate As (not an issue in training, but subtle risk for test).
 * process_chain clears the terminal sandwich entirely (sets its center to 0 after possible prior update), but if terminals should retain their B, this might over-clear— unclear from training, but test output has lingering values like 5s/3s that could be affected.
 * No cycle detection in chaining/recursion, but assuming acyclic from puzzle rules.
 * The explicit border positions in detection are helpful and match the irregular sandwich shape (not full 3x3 border, missing middle-center-left/right? Wait, positions skip (r+1,c+1) which is center, but include (r+1,c) and (r+1,c+2), so it's like a plus-sign border missing the very center sides? No, it's standard 8-around-center.
 * Overall, extraction of sandwiches and root-finding via incoming degrees is essential and correct; no unhelpful functions here—all provided are relevant, though clear_sandwich is aggressive (clears full 3x3 even if partial overlap).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It shows clearing in areas like row 0-4 col 7-9 (many 0s where 2/3/5 were possibly), updates like row 2 col 2=2 (possible center prop), and remnants like bottom 5s/3s/7s/1s/9s, suggesting chains were processed (e.g., a chain ending in 5 or 3 cleared intermediates but left roots updated).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several potential sandwiches remain uncleared, e.g., row 6-8 col 0-2 has 7/1/7 pattern that might be a border A=7 with center? but positions don't match exactly, and row 7-9 col 8-10 (edge) has 3s uncleared; also, isolated 4s in row 2/3 col 1/2 suggest a missed short chain or non-sandwich; top-right 2s in row 1/2 col 6-8 look like partial border not processed, indicating possible detection failure for edge/overlapping sandwiches or incorrect linking (e.g., if multiple As conflicted). Without expected output, it's hard to confirm, but the output differs from a "fully processed" grid by leaving more non-zero clusters than expected, possibly over-clearing some areas (e.g., row 8-9 col 1-5 all 5s/0s mixed) while under-processing others—note that it IS different from a clean/cleared grid, even if puzzle allows remnants.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based logic puzzle involving "sandwich" patterns, where 3x3 blocks with uniform non-zero border values (A) and a different non-zero center value (B) are detected and chained together based on B matching the A of a subsequent sandwich. The goal is to process chains starting from root sandwiches (those with no predecessors), updating the grid by placing the next sandwich's B into the current center and clearing the next sandwich's entire 3x3 area, ultimately simplifying or solving the grid through these operations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Sandwiches are strictly 3x3 blocks; borders consist of the 8 perimeter cells (excluding center), all must match A (non-zero), and center must be B (non-zero and != A); inner cells or partial matches do not qualify.
 * Chaining links a sandwich's B to the closest (Manhattan distance from centers) subsequent sandwich with matching A; if no match, next is None; multiple predecessors possible, but roots have zero incoming links.
 * Processing only occurs on chains from roots; for a chain, recursively set current center to next's B, then clear the entire 3x3 of the next sandwich (sets all 9 cells to 0), but do not clear the current one unless it's a leaf (no next).
 * Overlaps between sandwiches must be handled carefully, as clearing one may affect detection or linking of others; detection happens before any clearing, so all sandwiches are found on the initial grid.
 * Grid size is variable (e.g., 10x10 in test), but sandwiches only scanned up to n-2 to fit 3x3; borders can overlap, but uniform A check is per sandwich independently.
 * Subtle: Closest candidate breaks ties by first-found min distance; no directionality beyond closeness; chains are linear (one next per sandwich), but graph may have branches via multiple incoming.
 * Leaves (no next) are fully cleared; non-leaves have center updated but not fully cleared, allowing propagation of values backward in the chain.
 * Potential issues: If chains cycle (unlikely, as B != A prevents self-loops, but possible via multiples), but code assumes DAG; clearing may leave zeros that could mimic empty areas but doesn't re-detect.
 * All operations are in-place on a copy of the grid; final output is the modified grid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating correct detection, chaining, rooting, and processing for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * What worked: Uniform border detection skips zeros/inconsistencies properly; closest linking uses Manhattan distance correctly; chain processing propagates B values backward and clears appropriately without re-detection issues in training.
 * What didn't work: Fails on test input, likely due to complex overlaps, multiple candidates, or chain configurations where clearing affects implicit dependencies not captured pre-detection; for example, if sandwiches overlap, pre-clearing detection misses dynamic changes.
 * The `Sandwich` class is essential for encapsulating positions, values, and links, enabling graph-like processing.
 * `detect_sandwiches` is core and correct, as it handles border uniformity without including center; unhelpful if grid has non-3x3 patterns, but puzzle seems fixed to 3x3.
 * `assign_nexts` and `get_closest` are helpful for chaining but may fail subtly if multiple equidistant candidates (code picks first, which might not be intended if puzzle prefers specific direction like down/right).
 * `find_roots` correctly builds incoming graph; no cycles assumed, which holds since A != B prevents loops.
 * `process_chain` and `clear_sandwich` work for linear chains but may not handle branches (multiple incoming to one node) fully, as roots process independently but shared nodes could be cleared multiple times (though idempotent via zeros).
 * `program` orchestrates well but detects all upfront, which is good for isolation but misses if puzzle requires iterative detection post-clearing (unknown, but training passed without it).
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet; all provided are relevant, though `get_closest` could be enhanced for tie-breaking (e.g., by row-major order).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x10 grid with many zeros introduced and some values relocated (e.g., 2s, 3s, 5s moved or cleared in positions like row 1 cols 6-8, row 2 col 8, row 7 cols 7-9), but it does not appear fully correct as it leaves residual non-zero values in potentially uncleared areas (e.g., row 7 has 7,1,7; row 8 has 7,1,7) and isolated numbers like 9 in row 6 col 4, suggesting incomplete chain processing or missed sandwiches.
 * Expected output should have more comprehensive clearing of chained sandwiches and precise B placements in centers, likely resulting in fewer scattered numbers (e.g., propagating 5s or 3s further); the output has partial chains resolved (e.g., some 2s cleared around row 1-2) but others untouched (e.g., bottom 5s and 7s persist), indicating the closest-linking or rooting missed a key chain, perhaps due to distance calculation overlooking overlaps.
 * The output differs from expected by not fully simplifying the grid—visually, it looks like only some upper/mid chains were processed (e.g., 4s and 2s partially handled), while lower sections (rows 6-9 with 1,3,5,7,9) remain dense, possibly because roots were incorrectly identified or no next assigned for certain B values like 9 or 7.
 * It is different from expected for unknown reasons in chaining (e.g., maybe puzzle prefers nearest in a specific direction, not pure Manhattan), but the partial clearing shows core detection works; to handle test, update linking to consider only unprocessed candidates or iterate detection post-clear.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 05:42:12] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where 3x3 "sandwich" patterns (uniform non-zero border value A surrounding a different non-zero center value B) are detected, chained together based on B values linking to matching A values of nearby sandwiches, and then processed by propagating B values along chains while clearing processed sandwiches to zero, ultimately simplifying the grid by resolving these linked structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Sandwiches must have all 8 border cells exactly equal to A > 0, and center B > 0 with B != A; any deviation (e.g., zero in border or non-uniform border) invalidates the pattern.
 * Detection scans the grid in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) for top-left corners, ensuring sandwiches are found in a consistent sequence.
 * Chaining links each sandwich's B to the closest (Manhattan distance) subsequent sandwich with matching A; ties are broken by preferring the bottom-right-most (largest center_r, then largest center_c), which implies a forward/chaining direction and avoids cycles or backward links.
 * Roots are sandwiches with no incoming links (zero in-degree), processed in their original detection order; non-roots are reached via chains.
 * Processing is recursive per chain: for a sandwich with a next, update its center to the next's B, clear the entire 3x3 next sandwich to zero, and recurse; terminals (no next) are fully cleared.
 * All chains from roots are processed independently in root order, but since clearing happens recursively, overlaps must be handled carefully (though the code assumes no overlaps in sandwiches).
 * Grid is n x n (square), and sandwiches can't overlap edges (only up to n-2); post-processing, the grid should have propagated values in original centers and zeros where sandwiches were cleared.
 * Subtle: Incoming degrees for roots consider only explicit 'next' links, so isolated sandwiches are roots and get fully cleared; no self-links or cycles assumed.
 * Potential misses: If multiple candidates at same distance, tiebreak ensures deterministic selection; zeros anywhere in a potential sandwich invalidate it entirely; B propagation only updates the center cell, not borders.
 * Grid is copied before processing to avoid mutating input; output is the modified grid.

(Note: Other functions like find_roots, clear_sandwich, process_chain, process_all_chains, and program are also helpful and build on these, providing full chaining, root detection, and grid mutation logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully detects sandwiches with precise border validation and row-major ordering, which worked for all training examples.
 * Chaining via closest Manhattan distance with bottom-right tiebreak correctly linked B to matching A without cycles, passing training cases.
 * Root detection using in-degree counts and independent chain processing resolved propagations accurately for training 1-3, clearing terminals and updating centers as expected.
 * The recursive process_chain function properly handles chain propagation (update center to next.B, clear next, recurse) and terminals (full clear), which was key to correct outputs in training.
 * No overlaps or invalid sandwiches were mishandled in training, but potential subtlety: if sandwiches overlap partially, detection might create invalid patterns post-clearing (though training didn't test this).
 * assign_nexts builds candidates in detection order, ensuring get_closest selects from full list without removal, which avoided premature unlinking in training.
 * Overall, the program structure (copy grid, detect, assign, find roots, process) demonstrated core understanding and passed all training, but no prior attempts are detailed here— this seems to be the refined version building on implicit earlier ones.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., clear_sandwich is simple but essential for zeroing 3x3 areas) are relevant and not broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 10x10 grid with many zeros introduced (e.g., rows 0-4 have extensive clearing around positions like (1,7)-(3,9) for what seems like a 2-3-2 sandwich chain), and some values propagated (e.g., 5's appearing in lower rows, possibly from chaining 2->3->5 or similar).
 * It looks partially correct: clusters like the top-right 2's and 4's appear cleared/resolved (e.g., row 1 col 7-8 now 3 and 2, suggesting partial propagation), and bottom 5's and 3's seem handled (e.g., row 6-9 show scattered 1,3,5,7 with zeros filling sandwich areas).
 * However, it does not look fully correct—unexpected remnants like the 7 in (7,0) and 1 in (7,1) suggest incomplete clearing of a potential 7-1 sandwich chain; similarly, the 9 in (6,4) is isolated and uncleared, which might indicate a missed root or linking failure (e.g., no matching A=9 candidate, but it should be cleared as a terminal).
 * Differences from expected: Expected full zeroing of all detected sandwiches post-processing (e.g., the 3x3 around (6,6) with 5-3-3 should propagate if chained, but output has lingering 3's without full clear); observed output has asymmetric clearing (e.g., row 2 col 1-2-3: 4,2,4 uncleared, possibly not detected as sandwich due to missing uniform border check failing on adjacent zeros).
 * The output makes sense for chains like 4->2->3->5 (evident in scattered updates), but misses full resolution of isolated or bottom-left structures (e.g., 7-1-9 area in rows 6-7 not fully zeroed), indicating the closest-linking might select suboptimal targets in dense areas or fail on ties.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 05:42:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 10x10 grid of non-negative integers representing colored regions or blobs, where the goal is to process the grid by identifying connected components (likely 4-way adjacency) of the same number and modifying the grid based on whether those components touch the grid's border, ultimately producing a transformed output grid that matches specific expected patterns. The transformation appears to involve more than simple removal to 0, as expected outputs introduce or reassign new numbers (e.g., 2, 5, 9) in certain positions, suggesting rules for filling, relabeling, or preserving/modifying enclosed vs. border-touching regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right), as the code uses those directions; diagonal connections are not considered.
 * Border touching must account for all four sides (top row i==0, bottom row i==n-1, left column j==0, right column j==n-1); the current code only checks left and right (y==0 or y==n-1), missing top/bottom, which causes incorrect preservation/removal of components that touch only top or bottom.
 * The puzzle is not purely about setting non-border-touching components to 0 (removal/erasure), as expected outputs retain some original numbers but introduce new ones (e.g., in Training 1, new 5-blob on left and a 2 in the 3-region; in Training 2, new 5's and a 2 in the 8-region; in Training 3, new 9 in 1-region, scattered 5's, and 3 in 7-region), implying rules for relabeling enclosed areas, filling "holes" with new identifiers, or merging/expanding regions based on enclosure.
 * Enclosed regions (non-border-touching) may need to be filled or reassigned a new color/number rather than erased, while border-touching regions are preserved but possibly modified (e.g., holes filled or parts relabeled).
 * Grids may have pre-existing 0's (empty/blank cells) that act as separators or holes within blobs; the code visits only non-zero cells but doesn't explicitly handle filling internal 0's.
 * Components are processed in discovery order (row-major), which may affect relabeling if new numbers are assigned sequentially or based on position.
 * Subtle element: New numbers in expected outputs seem to form their own connected structures (e.g., 5's in Training 1 form a border-touching blob), suggesting the puzzle simulates "growing" or "infecting" enclosed areas from borders or applying a labeling scheme like Union-Find for regions.
 * All cells start as input values; output must exactly match expected, including positions of 0's and new/old numbers—no over-removal or incorrect preservation.
 * Potential for multiple components of the same color; each must be treated independently.
 * n=10 fixed size, but code handles general n.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current DFS-based component extraction is helpful for identifying connected same-color regions and checking properties like border touch; it can be reused/modified for relabeling instead of just zeroing.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_component(grid: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], bool]:
    """
    DFS to extract a connected component of given color starting from (start_i, start_j),
    returning the list of cells and whether it touches any border (all 4 sides).
    Assumes grid is not modified; uses a temp visited.
    """
    n = len(grid)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    component = []
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    touches_border = False
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        if visited[x][y] or grid[x][y] != color:
            continue
        visited[x][y] = True
        component.append((x, y))
        # Check all 4 borders
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1 or y == 0 or y == n - 1:
            touches_border = True
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == color:
                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return component, touches_border
```

No types like classes are needed yet, but could add a Component dataclass for cells and properties if relabeling logic grows complex.

The main program function is somewhat helpful as a skeleton (copies grid, iterates over cells, processes components), but its zeroing logic is incorrect/unhelpful for this puzzle—do not reuse the removal part; adapt for conditional relabeling (e.g., if not touches_border, assign new color like next available number).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements connected component detection via DFS/stack, avoiding recursion limits for n=10, and collects components properly, which is essential for analyzing enclosure.
 * Missed full border check: Only detects left/right touches (y==0 or y==n-1), so components touching only top/bottom are incorrectly preserved as if border-touching; this likely causes over-preservation in all training examples (e.g., in Training 1, 3's and 6's kept intact with internal 0's, but expected modifies with 5's and 2).
 * Fundamentally missed the relabeling/filling mechanic: Sets non-border components to 0 (erasure), but expected outputs introduce new numbers forming structured blobs (e.g., Training 1 generated keeps original 3's/6's with some internal 0's like [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3] in row 1, but expected has [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,3,2,3] with new 5-blob and 2 replacement; difference unknown but clearly not erasure—possibly enclosed areas filled from adjacent border regions or assigned sequential IDs).
 * In Training 2, generated preserves 2's and 8's/1's with internal 0's (e.g., [2,0,2,...]), but expected has mostly 0's in top, new 5's scattered/enclosed, and 2 inserted in 8-region ([8,2,8,...]); generated mismatches by not removing border-touching blobs and not creating new structures.
 * In Training 3, generated keeps 1's, 4's, 2's, 7's with internal 0's (e.g., [1,0,1,...]), but expected removes/modifies top 1's/4's to 0's, adds 9/5's in scattered positions, and inserts 3 in 7's; generated over-preserves and doesn't relabel.
 * The visited matrix prevents reprocessing cells, which works, but iteration order (row-major) may matter if new labels depend on discovery.
 * No handling of internal 0's as potential "enclosable" spaces; code skips 0's, but expected may fill them (e.g., Training 1 expected fills left/middle with 5's where generated has 0's).
 * Function for component finding is helpful and not broken (can be fixed for borders/relabeling); the overall program logic is partially relevant but the zeroing is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle—avoid erasure in future, focus on conditional assignment of new colors (e.g., increment a counter for enclosed regions).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it erases almost the entire grid to 0's (only partial 3's in rows 6-7 right side and a lone 7 in row 7 left), suggesting over-removal of most components, likely because few touch left/right borders due to the code's bug— but expected likely preserves/modifies border-touching structures (e.g., the 3's may touch top/bottom and need keeping/relabeling, and the 7 may be part of a larger relabeled blob).
 * Differences: Generated has isolated remnants (e.g., [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3] in row 6, but with 0's elsewhere), implying incomplete removal or wrong border detection; correct output should match expected patterns seen in training (e.g., new blob formations like 5's), not near-total erasure—possibly the test has enclosed 3's/7 that need relabeling to a new number rather than 0, or border-touching parts expanded.
 * The output makes little sense for a "visual puzzle" as it destroys most structure, unlike training expecteds which retain/modify visually coherent blobs; account for full 4-side borders and relabeling logic (e.g., assign enclosed components a new unique number starting from max+1) to handle test case without over-erasing.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle involving 3x3 "sandwich" patterns, where each sandwich consists of a uniform border value A surrounding a center value B, and sandwiches can form directed chains when the B of one matches the A of another. The goal is to process these chains starting from root sandwiches (those with no incoming links), updating the center of each sandwich in the chain to the B of the next one while clearing the cells of the subsequent sandwiches, resulting in a modified grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Sandwiches are strictly 3x3 and positioned such that the top-left is at (r,c) where r and c range from 0 to n-3; the border consists of exactly 8 specific cells (top row all three, middle row first and third, bottom row all three except possibly adjusted, but code uses explicit positions: (r,c),(r,c+1),(r,c+2),(r+1,c),(r+1,c+2),(r+2,c),(r+2,c+1),(r+2,c+2)), all must equal A (non-zero), center (r+1,c+1) must be B (non-zero, !=A).
 * Chains are formed by linking sandwich S1 to S2 if S1.B == S2.A; the code assumes at most one sandwich per starting A value (overwrites in color_to_sand dict), which could miss multiples or create incorrect links if duplicates exist.
 * Processing only occurs on root chains (sandwiches with no incoming links); for a chain, set current center to next.B, then clear the entire 3x3 of the next sandwich (sets all 9 cells to 0), and recurse on the remainder of the chain— this effectively "propagates" values along the chain while removing overlapped or linked sandwiches.
 * Grid is n x n (assumed square), and modifications are in-place on a copy; untouched cells remain as-is.
 * Subtlety: Detection skips if center==0 or borders not uniform/non-zero; chains may overlap in positions, but clearing happens after linking, potentially erasing partial sandwiches not yet detected.
 * Easy to miss: Only detects sandwiches where all 8 border positions match exactly; no rotation or irregular shapes; assumes A and B are integers representing "colors" or values.
 * Chains are acyclic (code doesn't check, but recursion assumes no cycles); multiple roots possible, processed independently.
 * After processing, the final grid should have chain-start centers updated to the end-of-chain B, intermediates cleared, and non-chain elements intact— this might leave isolated sandwiches uncleared if they have incoming but no root path.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class Sandwich:
    def __init__(self, r: int, c: int, A: int, B: int):
        self.r = r
        self.c = c
        self.A = A
        self.B = B
        self.center_r = r + 1
        self.center_c = c + 1
        self.next = None
```
(This class represents a detected 3x3 sandwich, storing position, values, and chain link; useful for building and traversing chains.)

```python
def clear_sandwich(grid: List[List[int]], s: Sandwich):
    for dr in range(3):
        for dc in range(3):
            grid[s.r + dr][s.c + dc] = 0
```
(This function erases a full 3x3 sandwich area to 0; essential for removing processed linked sandwiches.)

```python
def process_chain(grid: List[List[int]], current: Sandwich):
    if current is None:
        return
    if current.next is None:
        clear_sandwich(grid, current)
        return
    next_s = current.next
    grid[current.center_r][current.center_c] = next_s.B
    clear_sandwich(grid, next_s)
    process_chain(grid, next_s.next)
```
(This recursive function handles chain processing: updates current center to next's B if chain continues, clears the next sandwich, and recurses; for terminals, it clears the last sandwich. Key for propagating values and cleanup, but note it clears the last one entirely, which might not be intended if terminals should remain.)

```python
# Detection logic in program() is helpful for extracting sandwiches:
# Loops over possible top-left (r,c), checks 8 border positions all == A (from first border), center B !=0/A, stores in list and dict by A.
# Then links via next = color_to_sand[B], builds incoming defaultdict(list) for roots = [s for s in sandwiches if not incoming[s]].
```
(This extraction and chaining logic is core; uses defaultdict for incoming degrees to find roots efficiently.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly detects sandwiches based on uniform borders and non-zero center, forms chains via B-to-A matching, identifies roots, and processes by updating centers and clearing linked sandwiches— this worked perfectly for all three training examples, producing correct outputs.
 * What worked: Full 3x3 clearing and center propagation along chains; handling multiple roots; assuming unique A per sandwich didn't break training cases.
 * What didn't work: Unknown if test output is fully correct without expected result, but the generated test output shows partial clearing (e.g., some 2s,3s,5s remain or are updated, areas like bottom-right cleared to 0s) and updates (e.g., possible center changes visible in scattered positions), but it leaves some potential sandwiches uncleared (e.g., row 6-8 col 7-9 has 3s that might be a sandwich not processed), suggesting possible missed chains or overlaps; also, top rows have isolated 2s/4s that weren't cleared, which might be correct if not sandwiches but could indicate incomplete detection if borders aren't strictly checked.
 * The color_to_sand dict overwrites if multiple sandwiches share A, potentially breaking chains in cases with duplicate As (not an issue in training, but subtle risk for test).
 * process_chain clears the terminal sandwich entirely (sets its center to 0 after possible prior update), but if terminals should retain their B, this might over-clear— unclear from training, but test output has lingering values like 5s/3s that could be affected.
 * No cycle detection in chaining/recursion, but assuming acyclic from puzzle rules.
 * The explicit border positions in detection are helpful and match the irregular sandwich shape (not full 3x3 border, missing middle-center-left/right? Wait, positions skip (r+1,c+1) which is center, but include (r+1,c) and (r+1,c+2), so it's like a plus-sign border missing the very center sides? No, it's standard 8-around-center.
 * Overall, extraction of sandwiches and root-finding via incoming degrees is essential and correct; no unhelpful functions here—all provided are relevant, though clear_sandwich is aggressive (clears full 3x3 even if partial overlap).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It shows clearing in areas like row 0-4 col 7-9 (many 0s where 2/3/5 were possibly), updates like row 2 col 2=2 (possible center prop), and remnants like bottom 5s/3s/7s/1s/9s, suggesting chains were processed (e.g., a chain ending in 5 or 3 cleared intermediates but left roots updated).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several potential sandwiches remain uncleared, e.g., row 6-8 col 0-2 has 7/1/7 pattern that might be a border A=7 with center? but positions don't match exactly, and row 7-9 col 8-10 (edge) has 3s uncleared; also, isolated 4s in row 2/3 col 1/2 suggest a missed short chain or non-sandwich; top-right 2s in row 1/2 col 6-8 look like partial border not processed, indicating possible detection failure for edge/overlapping sandwiches or incorrect linking (e.g., if multiple As conflicted). Without expected output, it's hard to confirm, but the output differs from a "fully processed" grid by leaving more non-zero clusters than expected, possibly over-clearing some areas (e.g., row 8-9 col 1-5 all 5s/0s mixed) while under-processing others—note that it IS different from a clean/cleared grid, even if puzzle allows remnants.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based logic puzzle involving "sandwich" patterns, where 3x3 blocks with uniform non-zero border values (A) and a different non-zero center value (B) are detected and chained together based on B matching the A of a subsequent sandwich. The goal is to process chains starting from root sandwiches (those with no predecessors), updating the grid by placing the next sandwich's B into the current center and clearing the next sandwich's entire 3x3 area, ultimately simplifying or solving the grid through these operations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Sandwiches are strictly 3x3 blocks; borders consist of the 8 perimeter cells (excluding center), all must match A (non-zero), and center must be B (non-zero and != A); inner cells or partial matches do not qualify.
 * Chaining links a sandwich's B to the closest (Manhattan distance from centers) subsequent sandwich with matching A; if no match, next is None; multiple predecessors possible, but roots have zero incoming links.
 * Processing only occurs on chains from roots; for a chain, recursively set current center to next's B, then clear the entire 3x3 of the next sandwich (sets all 9 cells to 0), but do not clear the current one unless it's a leaf (no next).
 * Overlaps between sandwiches must be handled carefully, as clearing one may affect detection or linking of others; detection happens before any clearing, so all sandwiches are found on the initial grid.
 * Grid size is variable (e.g., 10x10 in test), but sandwiches only scanned up to n-2 to fit 3x3; borders can overlap, but uniform A check is per sandwich independently.
 * Subtle: Closest candidate breaks ties by first-found min distance; no directionality beyond closeness; chains are linear (one next per sandwich), but graph may have branches via multiple incoming.
 * Leaves (no next) are fully cleared; non-leaves have center updated but not fully cleared, allowing propagation of values backward in the chain.
 * Potential issues: If chains cycle (unlikely, as B != A prevents self-loops, but possible via multiples), but code assumes DAG; clearing may leave zeros that could mimic empty areas but doesn't re-detect.
 * All operations are in-place on a copy of the grid; final output is the modified grid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating correct detection, chaining, rooting, and processing for simpler or non-overlapping cases.
 * What worked: Uniform border detection skips zeros/inconsistencies properly; closest linking uses Manhattan distance correctly; chain processing propagates B values backward and clears appropriately without re-detection issues in training.
 * What didn't work: Fails on test input, likely due to complex overlaps, multiple candidates, or chain configurations where clearing affects implicit dependencies not captured pre-detection; for example, if sandwiches overlap, pre-clearing detection misses dynamic changes.
 * The `Sandwich` class is essential for encapsulating positions, values, and links, enabling graph-like processing.
 * `detect_sandwiches` is core and correct, as it handles border uniformity without including center; unhelpful if grid has non-3x3 patterns, but puzzle seems fixed to 3x3.
 * `assign_nexts` and `get_closest` are helpful for chaining but may fail subtly if multiple equidistant candidates (code picks first, which might not be intended if puzzle prefers specific direction like down/right).
 * `find_roots` correctly builds incoming graph; no cycles assumed, which holds since A != B prevents loops.
 * `process_chain` and `clear_sandwich` work for linear chains but may not handle branches (multiple incoming to one node) fully, as roots process independently but shared nodes could be cleared multiple times (though idempotent via zeros).
 * `program` orchestrates well but detects all upfront, which is good for isolation but misses if puzzle requires iterative detection post-clearing (unknown, but training passed without it).
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet; all provided are relevant, though `get_closest` could be enhanced for tie-breaking (e.g., by row-major order).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 10x10 grid with many zeros introduced and some values relocated (e.g., 2s, 3s, 5s moved or cleared in positions like row 1 cols 6-8, row 2 col 8, row 7 cols 7-9), but it does not appear fully correct as it leaves residual non-zero values in potentially uncleared areas (e.g., row 7 has 7,1,7; row 8 has 7,1,7) and isolated numbers like 9 in row 6 col 4, suggesting incomplete chain processing or missed sandwiches.
 * Expected output should have more comprehensive clearing of chained sandwiches and precise B placements in centers, likely resulting in fewer scattered numbers (e.g., propagating 5s or 3s further); the output has partial chains resolved (e.g., some 2s cleared around row 1-2) but others untouched (e.g., bottom 5s and 7s persist), indicating the closest-linking or rooting missed a key chain, perhaps due to distance calculation overlooking overlaps.
 * The output differs from expected by not fully simplifying the grid—visually, it looks like only some upper/mid chains were processed (e.g., 4s and 2s partially handled), while lower sections (rows 6-9 with 1,3,5,7,9) remain dense, possibly because roots were incorrectly identified or no next assigned for certain B values like 9 or 7.
 * It is different from expected for unknown reasons in chaining (e.g., maybe puzzle prefers nearest in a specific direction, not pure Manhattan), but the partial clearing shows core detection works; to handle test, update linking to consider only unprocessed candidates or iterate detection post-clear.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where 3x3 "sandwich" patterns (uniform non-zero border value A surrounding a different non-zero center value B) are detected, chained together based on B values linking to matching A values of nearby sandwiches, and then processed by propagating B values along chains while clearing processed sandwiches to zero, ultimately simplifying the grid by resolving these linked structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Sandwiches must have all 8 border cells exactly equal to A > 0, and center B > 0 with B != A; any deviation (e.g., zero in border or non-uniform border) invalidates the pattern.
 * Detection scans the grid in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) for top-left corners, ensuring sandwiches are found in a consistent sequence.
 * Chaining links each sandwich's B to the closest (Manhattan distance) subsequent sandwich with matching A; ties are broken by preferring the bottom-right-most (largest center_r, then largest center_c), which implies a forward/chaining direction and avoids cycles or backward links.
 * Roots are sandwiches with no incoming links (zero in-degree), processed in their original detection order; non-roots are reached via chains.
 * Processing is recursive per chain: for a sandwich with a next, update its center to the next's B, clear the entire 3x3 next sandwich to zero, and recurse; terminals (no next) are fully cleared.
 * All chains from roots are processed independently in root order, but since clearing happens recursively, overlaps must be handled carefully (though the code assumes no overlaps in sandwiches).
 * Grid is n x n (square), and sandwiches can't overlap edges (only up to n-2); post-processing, the grid should have propagated values in original centers and zeros where sandwiches were cleared.
 * Subtle: Incoming degrees for roots consider only explicit 'next' links, so isolated sandwiches are roots and get fully cleared; no self-links or cycles assumed.
 * Potential misses: If multiple candidates at same distance, tiebreak ensures deterministic selection; zeros anywhere in a potential sandwich invalidate it entirely; B propagation only updates the center cell, not borders.
 * Grid is copied before processing to avoid mutating input; output is the modified grid.

(Note: Other functions like find_roots, clear_sandwich, process_chain, process_all_chains, and program are also helpful and build on these, providing full chaining, root detection, and grid mutation logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully detects sandwiches with precise border validation and row-major ordering, which worked for all training examples.
 * Chaining via closest Manhattan distance with bottom-right tiebreak correctly linked B to matching A without cycles, passing training cases.
 * Root detection using in-degree counts and independent chain processing resolved propagations accurately for training 1-3, clearing terminals and updating centers as expected.
 * The recursive process_chain function properly handles chain propagation (update center to next.B, clear next, recurse) and terminals (full clear), which was key to correct outputs in training.
 * No overlaps or invalid sandwiches were mishandled in training, but potential subtlety: if sandwiches overlap partially, detection might create invalid patterns post-clearing (though training didn't test this).
 * assign_nexts builds candidates in detection order, ensuring get_closest selects from full list without removal, which avoided premature unlinking in training.
 * Overall, the program structure (copy grid, detect, assign, find roots, process) demonstrated core understanding and passed all training, but no prior attempts are detailed here— this seems to be the refined version building on implicit earlier ones.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., clear_sandwich is simple but essential for zeroing 3x3 areas) are relevant and not broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 10x10 grid with many zeros introduced (e.g., rows 0-4 have extensive clearing around positions like (1,7)-(3,9) for what seems like a 2-3-2 sandwich chain), and some values propagated (e.g., 5's appearing in lower rows, possibly from chaining 2->3->5 or similar).
 * It looks partially correct: clusters like the top-right 2's and 4's appear cleared/resolved (e.g., row 1 col 7-8 now 3 and 2, suggesting partial propagation), and bottom 5's and 3's seem handled (e.g., row 6-9 show scattered 1,3,5,7 with zeros filling sandwich areas).
 * However, it does not look fully correct—unexpected remnants like the 7 in (7,0) and 1 in (7,1) suggest incomplete clearing of a potential 7-1 sandwich chain; similarly, the 9 in (6,4) is isolated and uncleared, which might indicate a missed root or linking failure (e.g., no matching A=9 candidate, but it should be cleared as a terminal).
 * Differences from expected: Expected full zeroing of all detected sandwiches post-processing (e.g., the 3x3 around (6,6) with 5-3-3 should propagate if chained, but output has lingering 3's without full clear); observed output has asymmetric clearing (e.g., row 2 col 1-2-3: 4,2,4 uncleared, possibly not detected as sandwich due to missing uniform border check failing on adjacent zeros).
 * The output makes sense for chains like 4->2->3->5 (evident in scattered updates), but misses full resolution of isolated or bottom-left structures (e.g., 7-1-9 area in rows 6-7 not fully zeroed), indicating the closest-linking might select suboptimal targets in dense areas or fail on ties.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 05:53:07] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving detection and processing of 3x3 "sandwich" patterns in a square grid of integers (likely 10x10 based on examples), where sandwiches have a uniform border value A > 0 around a different center value B > 0, and the goal is to chain them logically (B of one links to A of another) before transforming the grid by propagating chain values and clearing processed sandwiches, ultimately simplifying or revealing hidden patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Sandwiches are strictly 3x3 with exactly the 8 border cells uniform at A > 0; the center must be B > 0 and B != A; no partial or overlapping detections are allowed—only full, non-overlapping valid patterns during initial scan.
 * Detection scans in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) starting from possible top-left positions (rows 0 to n-3, cols 0 to n-3), which affects linking order and root selection.
 * Linking: Each sandwich's B value points to the "next" sandwich where the target's A == current B; only consider "subsequent" candidates (later in row-major order by top-left (r,c)); among those, select the closest by Manhattan distance from the current sandwich's center to the candidate's center; ties broken by preferring the bottom-right-most candidate (largest center_r, then largest center_c), suggesting a forward-chaining direction.
 * Chains form directed graphs via 'next' pointers; roots are sandwiches with no incoming links; process chains starting from roots in detection order, recursively: for non-terminals, update the current center to the next sandwich's original B, clear the entire 3x3 of the next sandwich, then recurse on the next's chain; terminals (no next) are fully cleared to 0.
 * Grid is modified in-place during processing, but chains are built on the original grid—updates to centers happen after detection, so chains don't affect each other mid-process unless overlaps occur (but detection assumes no overlaps).
 * Subtlety: Clearing a sandwich sets its entire 3x3 to 0, which might create or destroy potential sandwiches, but processing is done post-detection on copies/links, so no re-detection; however, this can leave artifacts like propagated values in cleared areas.
 * Overlaps/Interactions: Sandwiches may visually overlap in the initial grid (e.g., shared borders), but detection treats them independently if they qualify; processing order (roots first) can cause one chain's clearing to affect another's visible result, but since processing is recursive and sequential, it prioritizes chain order.
 * Edge cases: Isolated sandwiches (no chain) get fully cleared; cycles aren't handled (assume acyclic); 0s are invalid for A/B and act as "empty" or barriers; values are small positives (1-9), suggesting color-like coding; final grid should have cleared areas as 0s and propagated centers revealing new patterns (e.g., new sandwiches emerging from propagations).
 * All examples are 10x10 grids; borders are 0-padded implicitly; no rotation or diagonal considerations—purely axis-aligned 3x3.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class Sandwich:
    def __init__(self, r: int, c: int, A: int, B: int):
        self.r = r  # Top-left row
        self.c = c  # Top-left col
        self.A = A  # Border value
        self.B = B  # Center value
        self.center_r = r + 1
        self.center_c = c + 1
        self.next: 'Sandwich' = None  # Linked next sandwich
```
(This class is helpful for representing detected patterns with positions and links; essential for chaining.)

```python
def detect_sandwiches(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Sandwich]:
    """
    Detects all 3x3 sandwiches in the grid where the 8 border cells are uniform A > 0
    and center is B > 0 != A. Scans in row-major order.
    """
    n = len(grid)
    sandwiches: List[Sandwich] = []
    border_offsets = [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]  # 8 border positions
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(n - 2):
            border_pos = [(i + dx, j + dy) for dx, dy in border_offsets]
            center_pos = (i + 1, j + 1)
            border_vals = [grid[x][y] for x, y in border_pos]
            A = border_vals[0]
            if A == 0 or not all(v == A for v in border_vals):
                continue
            B = grid[center_pos[0]][center_pos[1]]
            if B != 0 and B != A:
                s = Sandwich(i, j, A, B)
                sandwiches.append(s)
    return sandwiches
```
(This function is core and seems correct for initial detection; it preserves row-major order, which is key for linking.)

```python
def get_closest(candidates: List[Sandwich], target_r: int, target_c: int) -> Sandwich:
    """
    Finds the closest sandwich by Manhattan distance from (target_r, target_c).
    In case of ties, prefers the one with largest center_r, then largest center_c
    (bottom-right most, suggesting forward chaining direction).
    """
    if not candidates:
        return None
    min_dist = float('inf')
    closest = None
    best_r = -float('inf')
    best_c = -float('inf')
    for cand in candidates:
        d = abs(cand.center_r - target_r) + abs(cand.center_c - target_c)
        if d < min_dist:
            min_dist = d
            closest = cand
            best_r = cand.center_r
            best_c = cand.center_c
        elif d == min_dist:
            if (cand.center_r > best_r) or (cand.center_r == best_r and cand.center_c > best_c):
                closest = cand
                best_r = cand.center_r
                best_c = cand.center_c
    return closest
```
(This is helpful for tie-breaking in linking; Manhattan from centers is a key subtlety, and bottom-right preference aligns with forward chaining.)

```python
def clear_sandwich(grid: List[List[int]], s: Sandwich) -> None:
    """
    Clears the entire 3x3 area of the sandwich to 0.
    """
    for dr in range(3):
        for dc in range(3):
            grid[s.r + dr][s.c + dc] = 0
```
(Simple but essential for processing; in-place modification is correct as long as grid is copied upfront.)

(The other functions like assign_nexts, find_roots, process_chain, process_all_chains, and program are helpful as a full pipeline but have bugs in linking/processing order leading to incorrect outputs; retain for refinement, e.g., ensuring subsequent-only filtering in assign_nexts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it demonstrates core detection working (Training example 1 is CORRECT, fully clearing or processing a simple chain as expected).
 * What worked: Sandwich detection accurately identifies 3x3 patterns in row-major order (passes Train 1); linking logic partially works for simple forward chains; clearing and propagation basics are implemented (centers update to next B before clearing).
 * What didn't work: In Training example 2 (INCORRECT), generated output misses a propagated 8-border sandwich in rows 4-6 cols 0-2 with center 2 at row 5 col 1 (expected has 8s there from a chain propagation, but generated leaves 0s and misplaced 5/1s); also, row 4 cols 0-2 are 0s instead of 8s, row 5 col 1 is 0 instead of 2, and row 6 col 0 is 0 instead of 8—suggests a chain was not processed or linked correctly, possibly due to incorrect "subsequent" filtering or distance tie-breaking ignoring a bottom-left chain.
 * In Training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated output clears the top-left 1/4/9 sandwich area partially but leaves remnants (e.g., row 0 cols 7-9 still 4s instead of 0s, row 1 col 8 is 6 instead of 0), and completely misses creating/processing a new 7-border sandwich at bottom (rows 7-9 cols 7-9 with center 3 at row 8 col 8, expected); also, row 2 cols 7-9 are 4s instead of 0s—indicates over-clearing of one chain while under-processing another, likely because roots or recursion doesn't handle independent chains properly, or propagation doesn't reveal new patterns post-clear.
 * Overall issues: Linking may include non-subsequent sandwiches (e.g., earlier in order), causing wrong chains; processing order (roots in detection order) might process interfering chains first, clearing areas needed for later propagations; no re-detection after updates, so emergent sandwiches (like the 7s in Train 3) aren't handled—puzzle may require iterative processing until no sandwiches left.
 * Function `assign_nexts` is helpful but buggy (filters to subsequent but may fail on multi-candidate ties or backward links); `process_chain` is close but recursion might not propagate fully in complex graphs.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided are relevant, though the full `program` pipeline needs debugging for chain independence and iteration.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have partially cleared some areas (e.g., scattered 0s in rows 0-2 cols 0-6) but left incomplete patterns, such as a lingering 4/2 sandwich in rows 0-2 cols 1-3 that should likely be processed into a chain (possibly linking to the 5s below), and the bottom area (rows 6-9) has uncleared 1/7/5/3 clusters that resemble chained sandwiches (e.g., 1->9? then to 5s, and 7s potentially emerging), but generated keeps them messy with 9 at row 6 col 4 and 3s not propagated—expected should simplify to cleared 0s and perhaps a revealed pattern like a single propagated value or new border; differences include row 1 col 2 as 4 (expected 0?), row 6 col 3 as 9 (should be cleared or updated), and overall lack of full chain resolution, suggesting the same linking/processing bugs as in Train 2/3 prevent handling the test's likely multi-chain setup with overlaps.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 05:53:30] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train input-output pairs, the following are the only consistent interactions or connections observed across **all** examples (Train 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to elements that demonstrably interact (e.g., via containment, transformation, or removal) in every case. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated non-interacting shapes without consistent effects) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or unforced explanations are provided. Unknown aspects (e.g., specific transformation rules) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Orange Elements (Linear Bars and Standalone Blocks)**
   - **Properties**: Color = Orange; holes = 0; pixels vary (1 to 6+); bbox typically linear or block-like (e.g., horizontal/vertical spans).
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - No interaction with any other elements (colors, positions, or nesteds).
     - Consistently preserved unchanged: same color, holes, bbox, pixels, and position in every output.
     - Effect: Unaffected by any transformations or removals; acts as static background components.
   - **Consistency**: Present in all trains; identical in input/output across all examples. No variations or dependencies observed.

#### 2. **Nested Structures (Outer Frames and Inner Singles)**
   - **Components**:
     - **Outer**: Specific non-Orange colors (e.g., Green, Pink, Blue, Maroon, Dark Red, Red, Yellow); holes = 1; pixels = 8; bbox spans ~2 units in x and y (e.g., [x,x+2,y,y+2]).
     - **Inner**: Specific non-Orange colors (e.g., Yellow, Red, Blue, Green, Pink, Maroon, Light Blue); holes = 0; pixels = 1; bbox is a single point (degenerate, e.g., [x,y,x,y]) positioned at the center of the outer's bbox.
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - **Containment**: Inner bbox is always fully inside outer bbox (positional dependency: inner x/y ≈ outer center). Holes=1 in outer consistently indicates this embedding (structural property linking the pair).
     - **Color and Structural Effect on Fate**:
       - The pair (outer color + inner color) determines a joint transformation: either both removed entirely, or outer preserved (unchanged) and inner preserved (same position/bbox/pixels/holes=0) but with color changed to a new color.
       - Removal: Both outer and inner disappear completely (no partial retention). Observed in every train for specific color pairs (e.g., outer Yellow + inner Red/Green/Maroon; outer Green + inner Red/Pink; outer Blue + inner Green; outer Red + inner Pink/Light Blue). Rule for which pairs trigger removal is unknown (no consistent pattern identifiable from colors alone).
       - Preservation with Change: Outer unchanged; inner color transforms to a new color (e.g., original Yellow → Red; Blue → Green; Green → Red; Yellow → Maroon; Red → Light Blue; Yellow → Green). The mapping depends on the original outer + inner colors (interaction via color properties), but the exact rule is unknown (inconsistent direct color-to-color shifts across examples).
     - **Positional Effect**: No movement; if preserved, both stay in exact input positions. No interaction with external positions (e.g., no effect from nearby Oranges or other nesteds).
     - **Size/Pixels Effect**: Inner pixels=1 and outer pixels=8 are invariant within pairs; no change observed. These properties reinforce the containment link but do not drive transformations independently.
   - **Consistency**: Every train contains multiple such pairs; all non-Orange elements form these pairs with no exceptions. Transformations (remove or change inner color) occur only within pairs—no cross-pair interactions, no standalone non-Orange elements affected differently. Observed in all examples without variation in structure (always h=1 outer + h=0 single inner).

#### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- **No Other Consistent Interactions**: No evidence of color → movement, position → transformation (beyond containment), hole count → color (except within pairs), or shape silhouettes/edges affecting anything. No consistent effects from scattered elements, plus-shapes, or groupings (e.g., top-right clusters vary and do not reliably interact). Test inputs include non-nested singles/bars but no h=1 outers, so no nested interactions apply there based on train patterns.
- **Unknowns**: Exact rule for removal vs. preservation of pairs (color-dependent but not explainable). Exact inner color transformation mapping (depends on pair but inconsistent/direct links not observable). No forced connections (e.g., semantic color meanings like "warm/cool" not evident or consistent).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 05:56:38] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train input-output pairs, the following are the only consistent interactions or connections observed across **all** examples (Train 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to elements that demonstrably interact (e.g., via containment, transformation, or removal) in every case. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated non-interacting shapes without consistent effects) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or unforced explanations are provided. Unknown aspects (e.g., specific transformation rules) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Orange Elements (Linear Bars and Standalone Blocks)**
   - **Properties**: Color = Orange; holes = 0; pixels vary (1 to 6+); bbox typically linear or block-like (e.g., horizontal/vertical spans).
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - No interaction with any other elements (colors, positions, or nesteds).
     - Consistently preserved unchanged: same color, holes, bbox, pixels, and position in every output.
     - Effect: Unaffected by any transformations or removals; acts as static background components.
   - **Consistency**: Present in all trains; identical in input/output across all examples. No variations or dependencies observed.

#### 2. **Nested Structures (Outer Frames and Inner Singles)**
   - **Components**:
     - **Outer**: Specific non-Orange colors (e.g., Green, Pink, Blue, Maroon, Dark Red, Red, Yellow); holes = 1; pixels = 8; bbox spans ~2 units in x and y (e.g., [x,x+2,y,y+2]).
     - **Inner**: Specific non-Orange colors (e.g., Yellow, Red, Blue, Green, Pink, Maroon, Light Blue); holes = 0; pixels = 1; bbox is a single point (degenerate, e.g., [x,y,x,y]) positioned at the center of the outer's bbox.
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - **Containment**: Inner bbox is always fully inside outer bbox (positional dependency: inner x/y ≈ outer center). Holes=1 in outer consistently indicates this embedding (structural property linking the pair).
     - **Color and Structural Effect on Fate**:
       - The pair (outer color + inner color) determines a joint transformation: either both removed entirely, or outer preserved (unchanged) and inner preserved (same position/bbox/pixels/holes=0) but with color changed to a new color.
       - Removal: Both outer and inner disappear completely (no partial retention). Observed in every train for specific color pairs (e.g., outer Yellow + inner Red/Green/Maroon; outer Green + inner Red/Pink; outer Blue + inner Green; outer Red + inner Pink/Light Blue). Rule for which pairs trigger removal is unknown (no consistent pattern identifiable from colors alone).
       - Preservation with Change: Outer unchanged; inner color transforms to a new color (e.g., original Yellow → Red; Blue → Green; Green → Red; Yellow → Maroon; Red → Light Blue; Yellow → Green). The mapping depends on the original outer + inner colors (interaction via color properties), but the exact rule is unknown (inconsistent direct color-to-color shifts across examples).
     - **Positional Effect**: No movement; if preserved, both stay in exact input positions. No interaction with external positions (e.g., no effect from nearby Oranges or other nesteds).
     - **Size/Pixels Effect**: Inner pixels=1 and outer pixels=8 are invariant within pairs; no change observed. These properties reinforce the containment link but do not drive transformations independently.
   - **Consistency**: Every train contains multiple such pairs; all non-Orange elements form these pairs with no exceptions. Transformations (remove or change inner color) occur only within pairs—no cross-pair interactions, no standalone non-Orange elements affected differently. Observed in all examples without variation in structure (always h=1 outer + h=0 single inner).

#### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- **No Other Consistent Interactions**: No evidence of color → movement, position → transformation (beyond containment), hole count → color (except within pairs), or shape silhouettes/edges affecting anything. No consistent effects from scattered elements, plus-shapes, or groupings (e.g., top-right clusters vary and do not reliably interact). Test inputs include non-nested singles/bars but no h=1 outers, so no nested interactions apply there based on train patterns.
- **Unknowns**: Exact rule for removal vs. preservation of pairs (color-dependent but not explainable). Exact inner color transformation mapping (depends on pair but inconsistent/direct links not observable). No forced connections (e.g., semantic color meanings like "warm/cool" not evident or consistent).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
