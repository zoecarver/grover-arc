=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 06:16:37] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 06:35:10] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where a central row contains partial representations of digits (like 1,2,4,5,6,7,9), and the goal is to propagate or complete these digits vertically into full shapes (possibly inspired by seven-segment displays or similar blocky digit forms) across the grid, while filling the rest with 8s as background. The program identifies the center row (marked by 6s), extracts digit positions, and fills vertically based on digit-specific distances (d values) to approximate the height of each digit's shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The center row is identified by the presence of 6s, which seem to act as anchors or baselines for digit shapes; fallback to n//2 if not found.
 * Digits propagate vertically from the center row using a distance d that varies by digit type: e.g., 1 extends based on consecutive 6s (4 if >=3, else 1), 7 checks adjacency to 1s (3 if adjacent, else 2), 2 and 4 have fixed small extensions (2 and 1), 5 varies by column position (1 if j<=2, else 2), 9 depends on column relative to grid half (5 if j > half, else 1).
 * Only non-8 and non-6 centers trigger filling; 6s and 8s in center are preserved but not propagated.
 * Filling is symmetric around the center but clipped to grid bounds (start_row = max(0, center - d), end_row = min(n, center + d + 1)), overwriting with the digit in those columns.
 * Subtlety: 1's extension counts trailing 6s after its position, suggesting 1s might align with extended baselines; 7's adjacency to 1s implies relational rules between digits.
 * Grid size n is odd or even? Code assumes square n x n, but test output shows 17x17 (n=17), with half=8 for 9's rule.
 * Background is initialized to 8s, and center row is copied directly.
 * Potential miss: Digit shapes may not be purely vertical fills; horizontal aspects (e.g., 6s forming bars) or interactions between columns (beyond 7-1 adjacency) might be needed for full shapes.
 * No horizontal propagation in current code, which might explain incomplete shapes.
 * Training examples passed, implying the rules work for simpler cases, but test may have more complex interactions like multi-digit numbers or overlapping shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def find_center(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    for i in range(n):
        if 6 in g[i]:
            return i
    return n // 2
```
(This reliably identifies the baseline row using 6s as markers.)

```python
def compute_d(c: int, j: int, n: int, center_row: List[List[int]], one_positions: List[int]) -> int:
    # ... (as in the program)
```
(This central function encodes digit-specific propagation distances, capturing core rules for vertical extent; useful but may need refinement for position-dependent or relational tweaks.)

No other types or extraction functions are present; the code directly processes the grid without object extraction, which works for training but may miss holistic shape detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it successfully handles training examples 1-3, demonstrating understanding of center detection, digit-specific vertical propagation, and background filling with 8s.
 * The d computations for each digit type align well with training cases, correctly extending shapes like longer 1s near 6-runs or position-based 5s/9s.
 * However, no horizontal filling or shape completion beyond vertical lines per column, which works for simple vertical digits but fails complex test cases.
 * Relational rules (e.g., 7 depending on nearby 1s) are partially captured but may not account for multi-column digit widths (e.g., 2s or 5s spanning multiple columns).
 * find_center is robust and helpful; one_positions extraction is essential for 7's logic.
 * compute_d is mostly correct for training but brittle—e.g., 9's half-grid split assumes left/right asymmetry, which passed training but may not generalize.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall program lacks debugging output or shape validation, making it hard to see why test fails.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a very limited pattern confined to rows 6-10 (0-indexed), with vertical strips of 5s (columns 3-4), 2s (7-9), 7s (16), 9s (0 in rows 7-9), and scattered 6s (row 8, columns 1,5-6,10-15), while the vast majority of the 17x17 grid remains 8s.
 * Expected output should likely complete full digit shapes (e.g., blocky forms for 9,5,2,7) spanning multiple rows and possibly columns, based on the center row's partial digits, but this only does narrow vertical fills, leaving incomplete or missing extensions (e.g., no upward/downward beyond d limits, no horizontal bars for 6s or tops/bottoms of digits).
 * The pattern matches the program's logic (e.g., short d=1-2 for 5/2/4, longer for 9/1/7), but it looks wrong because it doesn't form recognizable digits—e.g., the 2s are just 3-column tall strips without serifs or connections, and 6s aren't propagated as baselines; this suggests the vertical-only approach misses horizontal/structural rules needed for the test's complexity (possibly wider digits or interactions).
 * Specifically, rows 0-5 and 11-16 are entirely 8s, indicating no spillover or multi-digit handling; the 9 in column 0 only fills rows 7-9 (d=2? but code suggests d=1 for j=0 < half=8), which is inconsistent with expected taller left-side 9.
 * Overall, the output makes partial sense as a literal implementation of the code but not as a puzzle solution, as it doesn't "complete" the visual elements into coherent shapes.

[2025-10-03 06:35:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 06:58:20] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving generating a full grid output based primarily on the center row of the input grid, where segments (groups) of consecutive same-color cells (non-6 values) in the center row are propagated vertically to other rows up to a maximum distance (max_d), filling with the group's color in the corresponding columns while leaving unfilled areas as 8's and preserving 6's as separators/barriers in the center row only. The propagation distance for each group is calculated asymmetrically based on whether groups are to the left or right of the "main" group containing the center column, with left groups getting limited depths and right groups potentially getting higher depths if unmatched to left colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 6's in the center row act as barriers that separate color groups but are not propagated to other rows; positions under 6's in other rows default to 8 unless overwritten by a propagating group (though groups don't cross 6's by definition).
 * Groups are defined as maximal consecutive sequences of the same non-6 color in the center row; single-cell groups (like the 9 or 7 in the test) are treated the same as larger ones for grouping but may get different max_d based on position.
 * The "main" group is the one containing the center column (n//2); if the center is 6, there is no main, and left/right are split around the center column; if there is a main, left groups are those entirely left of main_start, and right includes the main group(s) split by color plus any groups right of main_end.
 * Left groups are ordered from left to right and assigned max_d = min(k+1, (n-1)//6) where k is 0-based index (e.g., first left group gets 1, second 2, capped by grid size limit like ~2-3 for n=17); this caps left propagation to prevent overreach.
 * Right groups first try to match colors to left groups' max_d (reusing if same color exists on left, increasing matched_count); unmatched right groups get max_d starting from base = num_left_groups - matched_count, then + new_k (starting at 1), allowing right propagation to exceed left caps (e.g., can go to 3 or 4 even if left cap is 2).
 * Propagation is symmetric up and down from center row (d = abs(row - center_row)), filling only the exact columns of the group if d <= max_d; no diagonal or horizontal spreading.
 * Output initializes to all 8's, copies center row exactly (including 6's), then overwrites based on groups; subtle: 8's represent "empty" or background, and unfilled positions stay 8 even under 6's in center.
 * Easy to miss: When splitting main group into color sub-groups, each gets treated separately for right assignment, but in the provided code, it didn't split further since the main was uniform color; also, order of all_groups affects left assignment (left-to-right scan).
 * Cap (n-1)//6 limits left but not right, leading to asymmetry (e.g., left singles get low d=1, right singles can get high d=4); this may be intentional for "imbalanced" puzzles but could be a bug if puzzle expects symmetry or size-based d (e.g., group length influencing d).
 * If no main (center=6), left/right split strictly around center_col, with no "main_grps" inclusion in right.
 * Grid size n is odd (e.g., 17), center at n//2; propagation can't exceed edges (d max ~8 for n=17).
 * Colors are integers (e.g., 2,5,7,9), and same color on left/right reuses max_d, but only if exact match; no merging across 6's.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# The core program function is helpful as-is for extracting and processing the center row groups, calculating max_d asymmetrically, and filling the output grid.
# No separate classes defined, but the dict-based group representation (with 'start', 'end', 'color', 'max_d') is useful for tracking segments.
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (full code as provided; key parts: group extraction via while loop scanning center row, main group detection, left/right splitting, max_d assignment with color matching and base+new_k for unmatched, output init to 8's with targeted filling)
    pass  # See provided code for implementation
```

```python
# Implicit in the code: A group extraction helper (the while i < n loop) that skips 6's and collects consecutive non-6 same-color segments; this is essential for identifying propagatable objects and is correct/ helpful.
def extract_groups(center: List[int]) -> List[dict]:
    groups = []
    i = 0
    n = len(center)
    while i < n:
        if center[i] != 6:
            colr = center[i]
            st = i
            i += 1
            while i < n and center[i] == colr:
                i += 1
            groups.append({'start': st, 'end': i - 1, 'color': colr})
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the provided last (and only shown) submission; it successfully handled training examples 1-3 (all marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of group extraction, main component detection, asymmetric max_d assignment, and vertical propagation filling.
 * Worked well: Group scanning correctly identifies non-6 segments; left max_d capping at (n-1)//6 prevents over-propagation on left; color matching for right reuses left d's appropriately (assuming it was key in training); filling only group columns up to max_d produces symmetric up/down spread without crossing barriers.
 * Did not work / potential issues: For the test, the asymmetry in max_d (e.g., left 9 gets d=1, right 7 gets d=4 despite both being single-cell end groups) may violate puzzle symmetry if expected; unmatched right groups getting base + new_k (starting after num_left) allows right propagation to exceed left cap without bound, which succeeded in training but could be over-propagating in test (e.g., 7 reaches d=4 while left cap=2).
 * The inclusion of main_grps in right_groups and assigning them as "unmatched" (getting high d like 3 for 2's) worked for training but might miss a subtlety if main should get special treatment (e.g., higher/uncapped d or based on size).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; the provided group extraction is essential and correct (used in all processing); no broken functions, but the max_d assignment for right (base calculation) may need tweaking if training had fewer right groups.
 * Training examples likely had balanced left/right or matching colors, so asymmetry didn't surface; test exposes it with 2 left groups, 0 matches, leading to right d=3 and 4.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (n=17 grid) initializes correctly to 8's everywhere except center row (copied exactly, including 6's at cols 1,5-6,10-15), and propagates groups as per code: 9 (col0, d<=1) fills rows 7-9 col0; 5's (cols2-4, d<=2) fill rows6-7,9-10 cols2-4; 2's (cols7-9, d<=3) fill rows5-6,10-11 cols7-9 (and d=1 in 7,9); 7 (col16, d<=4) fills rows4-5,11-12 col16.
 * Observed effects: Propagation is symmetric up/down but asymmetric left/right in extent (left groups fade faster, right 7 reaches farther to rows4 and12); positions under 6's stay 8 in non-center rows (e.g., row9 cols1,5-6,10-15=8); no overwriting of center 6's; background 8's dominate outer rows (e.g., rows0-3 and13-16 all 8's, row12 has only 7 at end).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming puzzle expects symmetric treatment of end groups (e.g., both 9 and 7 as d=1 singles), the 7's d=4 over-propagates compared to 9's d=1, creating imbalance (7 visible in 9 rows total, 9 in 3); 2's d=3 exceeds left cap=2, filling to d=3 (rows5,11) while 5's stop at d=2— this may be correct if right gets priority, but looks suspicious if puzzle bases d on group order uniformly or size (all groups size 1-3, but d=1,2,3,4 ignores size). If expected output should cap all at (n-1)//6=2, then 2's and 7 overfill (e.g., no 2's in rows5/11, no 7 in rows4/12). The output matches the code exactly but may not match puzzle if asymmetry is unintended (unknown without correct test grid, but noted as different from symmetric expectation).
 * Overall, the test output makes logical sense per the code (no crashes, correct filling mechanics, barriers respected) but does not look fully correct for a symmetric puzzle— the extended right propagation (especially for 7) seems like a code artifact rather than rule-based, potentially missing a uniform cap or size-based adjustment; left matching works but unused here.

[2025-10-03 06:58:20] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where a central row contains partial representations of digits (like 1,2,4,5,6,7,9), and the goal is to propagate or complete these digits vertically into full shapes (possibly inspired by seven-segment displays or similar blocky digit forms) across the grid, while filling the rest with 8s as background. The program identifies the center row (marked by 6s), extracts digit positions, and fills vertically based on digit-specific distances (d values) to approximate the height of each digit's shape.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The center row is identified by the presence of 6s, which seem to act as anchors or baselines for digit shapes; fallback to n//2 if not found.
 * Digits propagate vertically from the center row using a distance d that varies by digit type: e.g., 1 extends based on consecutive 6s (4 if >=3, else 1), 7 checks adjacency to 1s (3 if adjacent, else 2), 2 and 4 have fixed small extensions (2 and 1), 5 varies by column position (1 if j<=2, else 2), 9 depends on column relative to grid half (5 if j > half, else 1).
 * Only non-8 and non-6 centers trigger filling; 6s and 8s in center are preserved but not propagated.
 * Filling is symmetric around the center but clipped to grid bounds (start_row = max(0, center - d), end_row = min(n, center + d + 1)), overwriting with the digit in those columns.
 * Subtlety: 1's extension counts trailing 6s after its position, suggesting 1s might align with extended baselines; 7's adjacency to 1s implies relational rules between digits.
 * Grid size n is odd or even? Code assumes square n x n, but test output shows 17x17 (n=17), with half=8 for 9's rule.
 * Background is initialized to 8s, and center row is copied directly.
 * Potential miss: Digit shapes may not be purely vertical fills; horizontal aspects (e.g., 6s forming bars) or interactions between columns (beyond 7-1 adjacency) might be needed for full shapes.
 * No horizontal propagation in current code, which might explain incomplete shapes.
 * Training examples passed, implying the rules work for simpler cases, but test may have more complex interactions like multi-digit numbers or overlapping shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def find_center(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(g)
    for i in range(n):
        if 6 in g[i]:
            return i
    return n // 2
```
(This reliably identifies the baseline row using 6s as markers.)

```python
def compute_d(c: int, j: int, n: int, center_row: List[List[int]], one_positions: List[int]) -> int:
    # ... (as in the program)
```
(This central function encodes digit-specific propagation distances, capturing core rules for vertical extent; useful but may need refinement for position-dependent or relational tweaks.)

No other types or extraction functions are present; the code directly processes the grid without object extraction, which works for training but may miss holistic shape detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it successfully handles training examples 1-3, demonstrating understanding of center detection, digit-specific vertical propagation, and background filling with 8s.
 * The d computations for each digit type align well with training cases, correctly extending shapes like longer 1s near 6-runs or position-based 5s/9s.
 * However, no horizontal filling or shape completion beyond vertical lines per column, which works for simple vertical digits but fails complex test cases.
 * Relational rules (e.g., 7 depending on nearby 1s) are partially captured but may not account for multi-column digit widths (e.g., 2s or 5s spanning multiple columns).
 * find_center is robust and helpful; one_positions extraction is essential for 7's logic.
 * compute_d is mostly correct for training but brittle—e.g., 9's half-grid split assumes left/right asymmetry, which passed training but may not generalize.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall program lacks debugging output or shape validation, making it hard to see why test fails.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a very limited pattern confined to rows 6-10 (0-indexed), with vertical strips of 5s (columns 3-4), 2s (7-9), 7s (16), 9s (0 in rows 7-9), and scattered 6s (row 8, columns 1,5-6,10-15), while the vast majority of the 17x17 grid remains 8s.
 * Expected output should likely complete full digit shapes (e.g., blocky forms for 9,5,2,7) spanning multiple rows and possibly columns, based on the center row's partial digits, but this only does narrow vertical fills, leaving incomplete or missing extensions (e.g., no upward/downward beyond d limits, no horizontal bars for 6s or tops/bottoms of digits).
 * The pattern matches the program's logic (e.g., short d=1-2 for 5/2/4, longer for 9/1/7), but it looks wrong because it doesn't form recognizable digits—e.g., the 2s are just 3-column tall strips without serifs or connections, and 6s aren't propagated as baselines; this suggests the vertical-only approach misses horizontal/structural rules needed for the test's complexity (possibly wider digits or interactions).
 * Specifically, rows 0-5 and 11-16 are entirely 8s, indicating no spillover or multi-digit handling; the 9 in column 0 only fills rows 7-9 (d=2? but code suggests d=1 for j=0 < half=8), which is inconsistent with expected taller left-side 9.
 * Overall, the output makes partial sense as a literal implementation of the code but not as a puzzle solution, as it doesn't "complete" the visual elements into coherent shapes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving generating a full grid output based primarily on the center row of the input grid, where segments (groups) of consecutive same-color cells (non-6 values) in the center row are propagated vertically to other rows up to a maximum distance (max_d), filling with the group's color in the corresponding columns while leaving unfilled areas as 8's and preserving 6's as separators/barriers in the center row only. The propagation distance for each group is calculated asymmetrically based on whether groups are to the left or right of the "main" group containing the center column, with left groups getting limited depths and right groups potentially getting higher depths if unmatched to left colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 6's in the center row act as barriers that separate color groups but are not propagated to other rows; positions under 6's in other rows default to 8 unless overwritten by a propagating group (though groups don't cross 6's by definition).
 * Groups are defined as maximal consecutive sequences of the same non-6 color in the center row; single-cell groups (like the 9 or 7 in the test) are treated the same as larger ones for grouping but may get different max_d based on position.
 * The "main" group is the one containing the center column (n//2); if the center is 6, there is no main, and left/right are split around the center column; if there is a main, left groups are those entirely left of main_start, and right includes the main group(s) split by color plus any groups right of main_end.
 * Left groups are ordered from left to right and assigned max_d = min(k+1, (n-1)//6) where k is 0-based index (e.g., first left group gets 1, second 2, capped by grid size limit like ~2-3 for n=17); this caps left propagation to prevent overreach.
 * Right groups first try to match colors to left groups' max_d (reusing if same color exists on left, increasing matched_count); unmatched right groups get max_d starting from base = num_left_groups - matched_count, then + new_k (starting at 1), allowing right propagation to exceed left caps (e.g., can go to 3 or 4 even if left cap is 2).
 * Propagation is symmetric up and down from center row (d = abs(row - center_row)), filling only the exact columns of the group if d <= max_d; no diagonal or horizontal spreading.
 * Output initializes to all 8's, copies center row exactly (including 6's), then overwrites based on groups; subtle: 8's represent "empty" or background, and unfilled positions stay 8 even under 6's in center.
 * Easy to miss: When splitting main group into color sub-groups, each gets treated separately for right assignment, but in the provided code, it didn't split further since the main was uniform color; also, order of all_groups affects left assignment (left-to-right scan).
 * Cap (n-1)//6 limits left but not right, leading to asymmetry (e.g., left singles get low d=1, right singles can get high d=4); this may be intentional for "imbalanced" puzzles but could be a bug if puzzle expects symmetry or size-based d (e.g., group length influencing d).
 * If no main (center=6), left/right split strictly around center_col, with no "main_grps" inclusion in right.
 * Grid size n is odd (e.g., 17), center at n//2; propagation can't exceed edges (d max ~8 for n=17).
 * Colors are integers (e.g., 2,5,7,9), and same color on left/right reuses max_d, but only if exact match; no merging across 6's.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# The core program function is helpful as-is for extracting and processing the center row groups, calculating max_d asymmetrically, and filling the output grid.
# No separate classes defined, but the dict-based group representation (with 'start', 'end', 'color', 'max_d') is useful for tracking segments.
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (full code as provided; key parts: group extraction via while loop scanning center row, main group detection, left/right splitting, max_d assignment with color matching and base+new_k for unmatched, output init to 8's with targeted filling)
    pass  # See provided code for implementation
```

```python
# Implicit in the code: A group extraction helper (the while i < n loop) that skips 6's and collects consecutive non-6 same-color segments; this is essential for identifying propagatable objects and is correct/ helpful.
def extract_groups(center: List[int]) -> List[dict]:
    groups = []
    i = 0
    n = len(center)
    while i < n:
        if center[i] != 6:
            colr = center[i]
            st = i
            i += 1
            while i < n and center[i] == colr:
                i += 1
            groups.append({'start': st, 'end': i - 1, 'color': colr})
        else:
            i += 1
    return groups
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the provided last (and only shown) submission; it successfully handled training examples 1-3 (all marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of group extraction, main component detection, asymmetric max_d assignment, and vertical propagation filling.
 * Worked well: Group scanning correctly identifies non-6 segments; left max_d capping at (n-1)//6 prevents over-propagation on left; color matching for right reuses left d's appropriately (assuming it was key in training); filling only group columns up to max_d produces symmetric up/down spread without crossing barriers.
 * Did not work / potential issues: For the test, the asymmetry in max_d (e.g., left 9 gets d=1, right 7 gets d=4 despite both being single-cell end groups) may violate puzzle symmetry if expected; unmatched right groups getting base + new_k (starting after num_left) allows right propagation to exceed left cap without bound, which succeeded in training but could be over-propagating in test (e.g., 7 reaches d=4 while left cap=2).
 * The inclusion of main_grps in right_groups and assigning them as "unmatched" (getting high d like 3 for 2's) worked for training but might miss a subtlety if main should get special treatment (e.g., higher/uncapped d or based on size).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; the provided group extraction is essential and correct (used in all processing); no broken functions, but the max_d assignment for right (base calculation) may need tweaking if training had fewer right groups.
 * Training examples likely had balanced left/right or matching colors, so asymmetry didn't surface; test exposes it with 2 left groups, 0 matches, leading to right d=3 and 4.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (n=17 grid) initializes correctly to 8's everywhere except center row (copied exactly, including 6's at cols 1,5-6,10-15), and propagates groups as per code: 9 (col0, d<=1) fills rows 7-9 col0; 5's (cols2-4, d<=2) fill rows6-7,9-10 cols2-4; 2's (cols7-9, d<=3) fill rows5-6,10-11 cols7-9 (and d=1 in 7,9); 7 (col16, d<=4) fills rows4-5,11-12 col16.
 * Observed effects: Propagation is symmetric up/down but asymmetric left/right in extent (left groups fade faster, right 7 reaches farther to rows4 and12); positions under 6's stay 8 in non-center rows (e.g., row9 cols1,5-6,10-15=8); no overwriting of center 6's; background 8's dominate outer rows (e.g., rows0-3 and13-16 all 8's, row12 has only 7 at end).
 * Differences from expected: Assuming puzzle expects symmetric treatment of end groups (e.g., both 9 and 7 as d=1 singles), the 7's d=4 over-propagates compared to 9's d=1, creating imbalance (7 visible in 9 rows total, 9 in 3); 2's d=3 exceeds left cap=2, filling to d=3 (rows5,11) while 5's stop at d=2— this may be correct if right gets priority, but looks suspicious if puzzle bases d on group order uniformly or size (all groups size 1-3, but d=1,2,3,4 ignores size). If expected output should cap all at (n-1)//6=2, then 2's and 7 overfill (e.g., no 2's in rows5/11, no 7 in rows4/12). The output matches the code exactly but may not match puzzle if asymmetry is unintended (unknown without correct test grid, but noted as different from symmetric expectation).
 * Overall, the test output makes logical sense per the code (no crashes, correct filling mechanics, barriers respected) but does not look fully correct for a symmetric puzzle— the extended right propagation (especially for 7) seems like a code artifact rather than rule-based, potentially missing a uniform cap or size-based adjustment; left matching works but unused here.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
