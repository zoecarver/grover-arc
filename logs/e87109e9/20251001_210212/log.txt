=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 21:02:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-01 21:08:45] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
def get_bar_colors(g):
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next(c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0)
    bar2 = next(c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0)
    bar3 = next(c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0)
    bar4 = next(c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4

def has_merge(bar2, bar3):
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    out = [row[:] for row in g[6:25]]
    bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4 = get_bar_colors(g)
    if not has_merge(bar2, bar3):
        return out
    protected = {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5}
    # Spread in rows with 8's
    for row in out:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 21:09:24] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 24-column grid (likely 19 rows shown in outputs) where colored bars (extracted from the second row of the input grid) define protected zones, and sequences of 8's (representing a spreading "ink" or "flood" element) expand horizontally within their rows only under a specific merge condition (if bar 2 or 3 is color 6), stopping at protected colors or edges, while leaving other numbers (like 1,2,3,4, etc.) intact unless overwritten by the spread.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid g is a List[List[int]] with at least 25 rows (indices 0-24), but the output focuses on rows 6-24 (19 rows), copying them initially and modifying only where 8's are present.
 * Bar colors (1-4) are extracted from specific segments of row 1 (indices 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22), taking the first non-zero value in each; these bars act as blockers for spreading, along with color 5 (a universal protector, possibly a special barrier).
 * Spreading only activates if has_merge is true (bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6), indicating a "merge" event that allows 8's to propagate; without this, the grid is returned unchanged.
 * When spreading in a row with 8's: identify contiguous sequences of 8's, then expand left from the start and right from the end, overwriting non-protected cells (anything not in {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5}) until hitting a protected cell or edge; this must be done per row independently, and only affects rows containing at least one 8.
 * Subtlety: Spreading does not cross protected cells, even if they are not bars (e.g., stops at existing 1's or other numbers if they match protected set); it also doesn't spread vertically—only horizontal per row.
 * Easy to miss: The protected set is dynamic per puzzle (based on bars), and 0's in row 1 are ignored for bar extraction; spreading overwrites blanks or other fillable cells but preserves protected ones; in some cases, 8's appear to "connect" across gaps only if unprotected.
 * Other considerations: Grids have repeating rows (e.g., three identical rows of bars or fillers), suggesting vertical stacking or patterns; numbers like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 represent distinct colors/objects that shouldn't be altered unless spread into; the puzzle may involve "ink" filling regions bounded by bars, but only triggers on merge.
 * From examples: Spreading creates "blobs" of 8's that respect bar boundaries (e.g., in ex1, 8's fill between bars but stop at 1's/4's if protected); non-merge cases might do nothing; test input has 9's as a new color, possibly a bar or filler, and partial 8's that should spread if merge applies.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bar_colors(g):
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next(c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0)
    bar2 = next(c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0)
    bar3 = next(c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0)
    bar4 = next(c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts bar colors correctly from fixed positions in row 1, ignoring 0's; useful for defining protectors.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2, bar3):
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(This checks the merge condition accurately; essential to gate the spreading logic, as non-merge outputs should be unchanged.)

(The main program structure—copying rows 6:25, checking merge, defining protected set, and iterating rows for spreading—is a good skeleton, but the spreading implementation is flawed as detailed below. No types like classes are used, but a protected set is helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and extracts bar colors via get_bar_colors, which matches the positional logic seen in examples (e.g., bars at columns 1-4,7-10,etc., with non-zero first value).
 * has_merge works as a trigger, preventing changes in non-merge cases (though all examples seem to be merge cases).
 * The protected set {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5} is a good idea, capturing blockers like bars and a special 5.
 * However, spreading logic is broken: it over-spreads 8's across entire rows or sections, ignoring actual protected cells in the row (e.g., in train1, it fills huge swaths with 8's and even changes non-8 areas to 3's incorrectly, instead of stopping at existing 1's/4's; expected has isolated 8 pairs like positions 8-9 and 16-17).
 * In train1: Generated has full rows of 3's at top and massive 8 blocks in rows 7-8, but expected has targeted 8's (e.g., rows 0-2: 8's only at cols 8-9,16-17; row 9: 8's at 4-5,8-9 but stops before protected 3's/4's); difference is over-filling and wrong base colors (3's where 8's shouldn't go).
 * In train2: Generated spreads 8's too far in rows 8-9 (full blocks), but expected has more precise 8's (e.g., row 0: 8's at 4-5,8-9; row 2: wide 8's from col 13-21 but starting from existing); also fails to spread into some gaps (e.g., row 4 has no 8's in generated but expected has them); introduces wrong 1's in bar areas.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly fills with 7's in early rows and over-spreads 8's in row 11-12, but expected has 8's integrated with 7's as blockers (e.g., row 0: 8's at 3-4,18-19; row 4: full 8's but stopping at 7's); misses connecting 8's across minor gaps while respecting 7/6 bars.
 * Overall: Attempt demonstrates understanding of bars, merge, and horizontal spreading concept, but fails on precise boundary detection (spreads past existing protected numbers like 1/3/4/6/7 if they match set but doesn't check per-cell in row); the while loops for left/right spread use row[] for checks but new_row for writes, causing overwrite issues or skipping; no handling for multiple 8 sequences per row properly.
 * get_bar_colors and has_merge are helpful and correct—keep them; the spreading loop is unhelpful/broken (over-aggressive, doesn't preserve non-8 non-protected cells correctly, and mutates incorrectly)—avoid reusing as-is.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It mostly copies the input with minimal changes (e.g., rows 0-2 full of 2's unchanged; rows 3-6 full 9's; only partial 8's in row 7 at cols 8-10, but no spreading despite likely merge), resulting in isolated 8's and untouched 9's/4's, which mismatches the pattern of controlled 8 expansion seen in training expecteds (e.g., should spread 8's left/right from row 7's position 8-10 into adjacent 9's if unprotected, potentially filling between bars like cols 4-11 or similar, stopping at 1's or extracted bars; instead, it leaves most 9's intact and doesn't propagate, suggesting the merge check passed but spreading failed to activate/execute properly).
 * Differences: No wide 8 blobs as in training expecteds (e.g., expected likely has 8's expanding in rows 7+ to connect or fill regions bounded by 1's/9's/3's, especially row 17-18 where 4's are, possibly overwriting some 9's but not 1's/3's); the output feels like a near-copy with buggy partial 8 insert, missing the "flood" effect; 9's seem treated as non-protected but not filled, indicating the spread logic doesn't target them correctly.
 * To handle test: Ensure spreading checks every row with 8's (row 7 here), uses the correct protected set (bars likely 2/9/?/3 or similar from row 1, plus 5), and propagates only horizontally without altering non-8 rows; mentally, if bar2 or 3 is 6, 8's in row 7 should spread left to col 4 (stop at 1's?) and right to col 11 (stop at 9's if protected), creating a blob like [1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,...].

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 21:09:24] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 21:22:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the task is to overlay or insert a special color (8) to highlight or connect specific linear or banded patterns, likely representing outlines, borders, or extensions of existing colored regions across horizontal bands of similar rows. The goal is to transform the input grid by replacing background or gap cells with 8's in precise positions to form paired or extended lines, while preserving other colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of horizontal "bands" of identical or near-identical rows, and processing must group these bands to identify patterns like runs of non-background colors.
 * 8's are placed specifically to form short pairs (e.g., two consecutive 8's) or extend existing lines, often adjacent to non-background runs of width <=4, but only in certain directions (e.g., right of left-side runs or left of right-side runs), and sometimes filling full horizontal segments in stacked bands.
 * Background color (most common cell value) must be ignored when detecting runs; runs are sequences of the same non-background color.
 * Subtlety: 8's often appear in positions that "bridge" or outline shapes across bands, such as vertical alignments (e.g., columns 8-9 and 16-17 in train 1), but not always full rows—e.g., in train 1 row 9, 8's are interrupted by 3's in specific columns.
 * Another subtlety: In stacked bands, 8's can propagate vertically or fill entire row segments if aligned (e.g., full 8 rows in train 1 rows 7-8), but only where patterns match across bands; isolated bands don't get full fills.
 * Placement rules seem tied to grid width (e.g., references to column 12 suggest a 24-column grid midpoint), with left-side runs (start <12) extending right, and right-side runs extending left, but only if width conditions are met and color != background.
 * Easy to miss: Existing 8's in input should be preserved or extended, but new 8's only replace background; overfilling (e.g., replacing non-background with 8's) breaks the output.
 * Vertical alignment is key—8's must match column positions across multiple rows in a band for consistency (e.g., train 2 has 8 pairs in columns 4-5, 8-9, 14-15).
 * Bands may have interruptions (e.g., train 1 row 9 has 8's with 3's in between), so run detection must handle non-uniform rows within a "band" of mostly similar rows.
 * No vertical processing in current code—puzzle likely requires checking alignments across bands, not just within rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty or short grids return empty; top 6 rows seem ignored (header?); color 8 has special handling (e.g., width >=2 triggers pairs).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for ignoring it in run detection.)

```python
def get_bands(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    bands = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        j = i
        while j < n and grid[j] == grid[i]:
            j += 1
        pattern = grid[i]
        runs = []
        k = 0
        m = len(pattern)
        while k < m:
            if pattern[k] == get_background(grid):
                k += 1
                continue
            color = pattern[k]
            start = k
            while k < m and pattern[k] == color:
                k += 1
            end = k - 1
            width = end - start + 1
            runs.append((start, end, color, width))
        bands.append((i, j - i, runs))
        i = j
    return bands
```
(This groups identical rows into bands and extracts non-background runs with positions and widths, useful for identifying candidate line positions; however, it assumes perfectly identical rows in bands, which may not hold if rows have minor variations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (3 in train 1, 1 in train 2, 7 in train 3) and groups rows into bands, which works for detecting horizontal patterns.
 * Run extraction in get_bands skips background and captures widths/colors, helpful for spotting short runs (<=4) that might need extension.
 * find_line_pairs attempts to detect positions for 8 pairs based on color 8 (width>=2) or short non-bg runs, adding adjacent positions (e.g., right of left runs), which partially aligns with pair placements but fails to propagate vertically or fill aligned segments.
 * In program, it copies the grid and only replaces bg with 8's in rows with detected pairs, using min/max columns to fill segments— this overfills horizontally (e.g., full 8's from col 4-20 in train 1 row 7) instead of precise pairs.
 * Train 1 generated: Overfilled rows 7-8 and 9 with continuous 8's in cols 4-17, ignoring interruptions (expected has pairs at 8-9,16-17 with 3's elsewhere; also missed upper pairs and lower extensions like row 12-15).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Rows 0-2 all 3's (correct, no change), but rows 3-6 should have pairs starting at row 3, not just lower; row 9 has full 8's instead of interrupted (8,8,3,3,8,8,3,3); rows 12-15 missed entirely (expected 8 pairs); bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 2 generated: Filled cols 4-15 with 8's in rows 7-8 and 10, but expected has pairs at specific columns (4-5,8-9,14-15) across more rows (e.g., rows 0-1,3-4,5-8,9-10); missed vertical extensions in row 2 (full 8's cols 14-21); row 14 has full 8's cols 8-21 (wrong, expected pairs).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper rows 0-1 have no 8's (expected pairs); row 2 all 1's (expected long 8's); rows 11-12 missed pairs; bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 3 generated: Filled cols 3-19 with 8's in rows 11-12, but expected has more distributed pairs (e.g., cols 3-4,13-14 in upper rows); rows 4-7 all 7's (missed 8 extensions); row 16 has 8's only in detected band (wrong positions).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Rows 0-2 have 3's unchanged (expected pairs at 3-4,18-19); rows 4-6 all 7's (expected full 8's cols 0-7,19-20); row 6 has partial (expected more); rows 13-15 missed pairs and full 8's; function assumes exact row equality for bands, but train 3 row 6 differs slightly from above.
 * Overall, program ignores vertical alignment across bands, leading to no propagation (e.g., no 8's in upper bands of train 1); line_pairs only adds single adjacent cells, not pairs or fills.
 * find_line_pairs is broken/not helpful: It adds (start, start+1) for color 8 width>=2 (but start is run start, so wrong positions); for other runs, adds single cells adjacent but not pairs, and only if start<12 or end>11 (midpoint logic partial but incomplete); doesn't handle full fills or interruptions.
 * get_bands is mostly helpful but skips bg in runs correctly; however, doesn't handle near-identical bands (e.g., if rows differ by 1 cell).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills large horizontal segments with 8's (e.g., rows 7-9 cols 3-20 full 8's, row 13 cols 3-20 full 9's unchanged but should likely get pairs) instead of precise pairs or aligned extensions, similar to training errors.
 * In test, top rows 0-2 all 2's (likely correct, no change); rows 3-5 all 9's (correct); row 6 has 1's in cols 0-2 then 9's (partial, but expected probably 8 pairs around the 1's); rows 7-9 overfilled with 8's across most cols (expected pairs like cols 3-4, perhaps 12-13 based on pattern); rows 10-12 1's then 9's (missed 8's); rows 13-15 full 9's in cols 3+ (wrong, likely need pairs); rows 16-17 all 9's (correct?); rows 18-20 have 4's in cols 7-15 (unchanged, but may need 8 outlines); bottom all 9's (correct). It ignores vertical patterns (e.g., the left 1's in rows 6-12 suggest a vertical shape needing 8 borders on right).
 * No vertical propagation: The 1's on left in rows 6-12 align vertically, likely needing 8 pairs to the right (e.g., cols 3-4), but output only fills in row 7-9 band; bottom 4's band unchanged despite being a distinct run.
 * Overfilling bg with 8's in detected bands, but test has bg=9 (most common), so runs of 2/1/4 should trigger specific pair placements, not full rows; misses potential full 8 rows if aligned across bands (none here, but code doesn't check).

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 21:22:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 24-column grid (likely 19 rows shown in outputs) where colored bars (extracted from the second row of the input grid) define protected zones, and sequences of 8's (representing a spreading "ink" or "flood" element) expand horizontally within their rows only under a specific merge condition (if bar 2 or 3 is color 6), stopping at protected colors or edges, while leaving other numbers (like 1,2,3,4, etc.) intact unless overwritten by the spread.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid g is a List[List[int]] with at least 25 rows (indices 0-24), but the output focuses on rows 6-24 (19 rows), copying them initially and modifying only where 8's are present.
 * Bar colors (1-4) are extracted from specific segments of row 1 (indices 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22), taking the first non-zero value in each; these bars act as blockers for spreading, along with color 5 (a universal protector, possibly a special barrier).
 * Spreading only activates if has_merge is true (bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6), indicating a "merge" event that allows 8's to propagate; without this, the grid is returned unchanged.
 * When spreading in a row with 8's: identify contiguous sequences of 8's, then expand left from the start and right from the end, overwriting non-protected cells (anything not in {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5}) until hitting a protected cell or edge; this must be done per row independently, and only affects rows containing at least one 8.
 * Subtlety: Spreading does not cross protected cells, even if they are not bars (e.g., stops at existing 1's or other numbers if they match protected set); it also doesn't spread vertically—only horizontal per row.
 * Easy to miss: The protected set is dynamic per puzzle (based on bars), and 0's in row 1 are ignored for bar extraction; spreading overwrites blanks or other fillable cells but preserves protected ones; in some cases, 8's appear to "connect" across gaps only if unprotected.
 * Other considerations: Grids have repeating rows (e.g., three identical rows of bars or fillers), suggesting vertical stacking or patterns; numbers like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 represent distinct colors/objects that shouldn't be altered unless spread into; the puzzle may involve "ink" filling regions bounded by bars, but only triggers on merge.
 * From examples: Spreading creates "blobs" of 8's that respect bar boundaries (e.g., in ex1, 8's fill between bars but stop at 1's/4's if protected); non-merge cases might do nothing; test input has 9's as a new color, possibly a bar or filler, and partial 8's that should spread if merge applies.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bar_colors(g):
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next(c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0)
    bar2 = next(c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0)
    bar3 = next(c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0)
    bar4 = next(c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts bar colors correctly from fixed positions in row 1, ignoring 0's; useful for defining protectors.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2, bar3):
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(This checks the merge condition accurately; essential to gate the spreading logic, as non-merge outputs should be unchanged.)

(The main program structure—copying rows 6:25, checking merge, defining protected set, and iterating rows for spreading—is a good skeleton, but the spreading implementation is flawed as detailed below. No types like classes are used, but a protected set is helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and extracts bar colors via get_bar_colors, which matches the positional logic seen in examples (e.g., bars at columns 1-4,7-10,etc., with non-zero first value).
 * has_merge works as a trigger, preventing changes in non-merge cases (though all examples seem to be merge cases).
 * The protected set {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5} is a good idea, capturing blockers like bars and a special 5.
 * However, spreading logic is broken: it over-spreads 8's across entire rows or sections, ignoring actual protected cells in the row (e.g., in train1, it fills huge swaths with 8's and even changes non-8 areas to 3's incorrectly, instead of stopping at existing 1's/4's; expected has isolated 8 pairs like positions 8-9 and 16-17).
 * In train1: Generated has full rows of 3's at top and massive 8 blocks in rows 7-8, but expected has targeted 8's (e.g., rows 0-2: 8's only at cols 8-9,16-17; row 9: 8's at 4-5,8-9 but stops before protected 3's/4's); difference is over-filling and wrong base colors (3's where 8's shouldn't go).
 * In train2: Generated spreads 8's too far in rows 8-9 (full blocks), but expected has more precise 8's (e.g., row 0: 8's at 4-5,8-9; row 2: wide 8's from col 13-21 but starting from existing); also fails to spread into some gaps (e.g., row 4 has no 8's in generated but expected has them); introduces wrong 1's in bar areas.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly fills with 7's in early rows and over-spreads 8's in row 11-12, but expected has 8's integrated with 7's as blockers (e.g., row 0: 8's at 3-4,18-19; row 4: full 8's but stopping at 7's); misses connecting 8's across minor gaps while respecting 7/6 bars.
 * Overall: Attempt demonstrates understanding of bars, merge, and horizontal spreading concept, but fails on precise boundary detection (spreads past existing protected numbers like 1/3/4/6/7 if they match set but doesn't check per-cell in row); the while loops for left/right spread use row[] for checks but new_row for writes, causing overwrite issues or skipping; no handling for multiple 8 sequences per row properly.
 * get_bar_colors and has_merge are helpful and correct—keep them; the spreading loop is unhelpful/broken (over-aggressive, doesn't preserve non-8 non-protected cells correctly, and mutates incorrectly)—avoid reusing as-is.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It mostly copies the input with minimal changes (e.g., rows 0-2 full of 2's unchanged; rows 3-6 full 9's; only partial 8's in row 7 at cols 8-10, but no spreading despite likely merge), resulting in isolated 8's and untouched 9's/4's, which mismatches the pattern of controlled 8 expansion seen in training expecteds (e.g., should spread 8's left/right from row 7's position 8-10 into adjacent 9's if unprotected, potentially filling between bars like cols 4-11 or similar, stopping at 1's or extracted bars; instead, it leaves most 9's intact and doesn't propagate, suggesting the merge check passed but spreading failed to activate/execute properly).
 * Differences: No wide 8 blobs as in training expecteds (e.g., expected likely has 8's expanding in rows 7+ to connect or fill regions bounded by 1's/9's/3's, especially row 17-18 where 4's are, possibly overwriting some 9's but not 1's/3's); the output feels like a near-copy with buggy partial 8 insert, missing the "flood" effect; 9's seem treated as non-protected but not filled, indicating the spread logic doesn't target them correctly.
 * To handle test: Ensure spreading checks every row with 8's (row 7 here), uses the correct protected set (bars likely 2/9/?/3 or similar from row 1, plus 5), and propagates only horizontally without altering non-8 rows; mentally, if bar2 or 3 is 6, 8's in row 7 should spread left to col 4 (stop at 1's?) and right to col 11 (stop at 9's if protected), creating a blob like [1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,...].

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the task is to overlay or insert a special color (8) to highlight or connect specific linear or banded patterns, likely representing outlines, borders, or extensions of existing colored regions across horizontal bands of similar rows. The goal is to transform the input grid by replacing background or gap cells with 8's in precise positions to form paired or extended lines, while preserving other colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of horizontal "bands" of identical or near-identical rows, and processing must group these bands to identify patterns like runs of non-background colors.
 * 8's are placed specifically to form short pairs (e.g., two consecutive 8's) or extend existing lines, often adjacent to non-background runs of width <=4, but only in certain directions (e.g., right of left-side runs or left of right-side runs), and sometimes filling full horizontal segments in stacked bands.
 * Background color (most common cell value) must be ignored when detecting runs; runs are sequences of the same non-background color.
 * Subtlety: 8's often appear in positions that "bridge" or outline shapes across bands, such as vertical alignments (e.g., columns 8-9 and 16-17 in train 1), but not always full rows—e.g., in train 1 row 9, 8's are interrupted by 3's in specific columns.
 * Another subtlety: In stacked bands, 8's can propagate vertically or fill entire row segments if aligned (e.g., full 8 rows in train 1 rows 7-8), but only where patterns match across bands; isolated bands don't get full fills.
 * Placement rules seem tied to grid width (e.g., references to column 12 suggest a 24-column grid midpoint), with left-side runs (start <12) extending right, and right-side runs extending left, but only if width conditions are met and color != background.
 * Easy to miss: Existing 8's in input should be preserved or extended, but new 8's only replace background; overfilling (e.g., replacing non-background with 8's) breaks the output.
 * Vertical alignment is key—8's must match column positions across multiple rows in a band for consistency (e.g., train 2 has 8 pairs in columns 4-5, 8-9, 14-15).
 * Bands may have interruptions (e.g., train 1 row 9 has 8's with 3's in between), so run detection must handle non-uniform rows within a "band" of mostly similar rows.
 * No vertical processing in current code—puzzle likely requires checking alignments across bands, not just within rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty or short grids return empty; top 6 rows seem ignored (header?); color 8 has special handling (e.g., width >=2 triggers pairs).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for ignoring it in run detection.)

```python
def get_bands(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    bands = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        j = i
        while j < n and grid[j] == grid[i]:
            j += 1
        pattern = grid[i]
        runs = []
        k = 0
        m = len(pattern)
        while k < m:
            if pattern[k] == get_background(grid):
                k += 1
                continue
            color = pattern[k]
            start = k
            while k < m and pattern[k] == color:
                k += 1
            end = k - 1
            width = end - start + 1
            runs.append((start, end, color, width))
        bands.append((i, j - i, runs))
        i = j
    return bands
```
(This groups identical rows into bands and extracts non-background runs with positions and widths, useful for identifying candidate line positions; however, it assumes perfectly identical rows in bands, which may not hold if rows have minor variations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (3 in train 1, 1 in train 2, 7 in train 3) and groups rows into bands, which works for detecting horizontal patterns.
 * Run extraction in get_bands skips background and captures widths/colors, helpful for spotting short runs (<=4) that might need extension.
 * find_line_pairs attempts to detect positions for 8 pairs based on color 8 (width>=2) or short non-bg runs, adding adjacent positions (e.g., right of left runs), which partially aligns with pair placements but fails to propagate vertically or fill aligned segments.
 * In program, it copies the grid and only replaces bg with 8's in rows with detected pairs, using min/max columns to fill segments— this overfills horizontally (e.g., full 8's from col 4-20 in train 1 row 7) instead of precise pairs.
 * Train 1 generated: Overfilled rows 7-8 and 9 with continuous 8's in cols 4-17, ignoring interruptions (expected has pairs at 8-9,16-17 with 3's elsewhere; also missed upper pairs and lower extensions like row 12-15).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Rows 0-2 all 3's (correct, no change), but rows 3-6 should have pairs starting at row 3, not just lower; row 9 has full 8's instead of interrupted (8,8,3,3,8,8,3,3); rows 12-15 missed entirely (expected 8 pairs); bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 2 generated: Filled cols 4-15 with 8's in rows 7-8 and 10, but expected has pairs at specific columns (4-5,8-9,14-15) across more rows (e.g., rows 0-1,3-4,5-8,9-10); missed vertical extensions in row 2 (full 8's cols 14-21); row 14 has full 8's cols 8-21 (wrong, expected pairs).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper rows 0-1 have no 8's (expected pairs); row 2 all 1's (expected long 8's); rows 11-12 missed pairs; bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 3 generated: Filled cols 3-19 with 8's in rows 11-12, but expected has more distributed pairs (e.g., cols 3-4,13-14 in upper rows); rows 4-7 all 7's (missed 8 extensions); row 16 has 8's only in detected band (wrong positions).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Rows 0-2 have 3's unchanged (expected pairs at 3-4,18-19); rows 4-6 all 7's (expected full 8's cols 0-7,19-20); row 6 has partial (expected more); rows 13-15 missed pairs and full 8's; function assumes exact row equality for bands, but train 3 row 6 differs slightly from above.
 * Overall, program ignores vertical alignment across bands, leading to no propagation (e.g., no 8's in upper bands of train 1); line_pairs only adds single adjacent cells, not pairs or fills.
 * find_line_pairs is broken/not helpful: It adds (start, start+1) for color 8 width>=2 (but start is run start, so wrong positions); for other runs, adds single cells adjacent but not pairs, and only if start<12 or end>11 (midpoint logic partial but incomplete); doesn't handle full fills or interruptions.
 * get_bands is mostly helpful but skips bg in runs correctly; however, doesn't handle near-identical bands (e.g., if rows differ by 1 cell).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills large horizontal segments with 8's (e.g., rows 7-9 cols 3-20 full 8's, row 13 cols 3-20 full 9's unchanged but should likely get pairs) instead of precise pairs or aligned extensions, similar to training errors.
 * In test, top rows 0-2 all 2's (likely correct, no change); rows 3-5 all 9's (correct); row 6 has 1's in cols 0-2 then 9's (partial, but expected probably 8 pairs around the 1's); rows 7-9 overfilled with 8's across most cols (expected pairs like cols 3-4, perhaps 12-13 based on pattern); rows 10-12 1's then 9's (missed 8's); rows 13-15 full 9's in cols 3+ (wrong, likely need pairs); rows 16-17 all 9's (correct?); rows 18-20 have 4's in cols 7-15 (unchanged, but may need 8 outlines); bottom all 9's (correct). It ignores vertical patterns (e.g., the left 1's in rows 6-12 suggest a vertical shape needing 8 borders on right).
 * No vertical propagation: The 1's on left in rows 6-12 align vertically, likely needing 8 pairs to the right (e.g., cols 3-4), but output only fills in row 7-9 band; bottom 4's band unchanged despite being a distinct run.
 * Overfilling bg with 8's in detected bands, but test has bg=9 (most common), so runs of 2/1/4 should trigger specific pair placements, not full rows; misses potential full 8 rows if aligned across bands (none here, but code doesn't check).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 21:36:17] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to generate a modified version of a subgrid (rows 6-24) by spreading a special "ink" or filler (value 8) from initial seeds or patterns, influenced by background color detection, vertical bars with specific colors (like 6 indicating merges), and rules for expanding 8's into adjacent background cells while preserving other structures like colored blocks or bars.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a background color (most common value across the entire input grid), which 8's can spread into horizontally in affected rows, but only adjacent to existing 8's or seeds; spreading does not overwrite non-background cells (e.g., colored blocks like 1's, 3's, 4's, or bars).
 * Vertical bars (likely in fixed columns like 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22 based on code attempts) have colors that trigger rules: a bar color of 6 in bar2 or bar3 indicates a "merge" mode, which seeds additional 8's in specific column pairs across all output rows where the background is present.
 * Initial seeds for 8's come from finding consecutive 8's (length >=2) in the input subgrid rows; during merge, seed two adjacent columns (e.g., start and start+1 of the first such pair found) with 8's in all rows if those positions are background.
 * Spreading of 8's is horizontal only, expanding left/right from clusters of 8's into background, but only applied to rows that originally contain at least one 8 in the input; this can create filled horizontal bands or connect sections.
 * Subtleties: Merges create vertical "pillars" of 8's that then spread horizontally in subsequent rows; not all rows spread equally—some expected outputs show partial spreading (e.g., only left or right sides), and 8's can form large connected blobs vertically/horizontally but respect block boundaries. Bars and blocks (e.g., sequences of same color like 1's or 4's) must not be overwritten. In non-merge cases, spreading might be minimal or absent. Easy to miss: seed positions are column-based across all rows, but spreading is per-row; background detection uses the whole grid, including non-subgrid rows. Also, 8's in input might already be present, and spreading should chain (e.g., fill gaps between multiple 8 clusters in a row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where initial pair is not found (return None, no seeding); spreading must skip over non-background (e.g., don't spread into a 4-block); vertical alignment of 8's from seeding must propagate spreading in lower rows; in merge, seeding happens before spreading, and only in background positions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    # Extracts colors from fixed bar positions in row 1 (0-indexed), taking first non-zero in each bar segment.
    # Helpful for detecting triggers like bar2/bar3 == 6.
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)
    bar2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    bar3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    bar4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```

```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Detects the most common color in the entire flattened grid as background.
    # Essential for spreading decisions; assumes non-empty grid.
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def has_merge(bar2: int, bar3: int) -> bool:
    # Simple check for merge trigger based on bar colors.
    # Useful but too narrow—may need expansion if other bars trigger rules.
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```

```python
def get_initial_pair(g: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Scans subgrid rows for first consecutive 8's (>=2 length) and returns column start and start+1.
    # Helpful for seeding in merge mode, but assumes only one pair and first occurrence; may miss if no such pair or if pairs vary per row.
    for row in g[6:25]:
        i = 0
        n = len(row)
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == 8:
                start = i
                while i < n and row[i] == 8:
                    i += 1
                end = i - 1
                if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                    return (start, start + 1)
                i = end + 1
            else:
                i += 1
    return None
```

```python
def spread_row(row: List[int], background: int) -> List[int]:
    # Copies row and spreads 8's left/right into adjacent background cells from each 8 cluster.
    # Helpful for horizontal expansion, but only processes if 8 present in original; chains spreading by iterating and expanding boundaries.
    # Note: Current impl starts from left, expands each cluster, but may need to re-scan after expansions for full chaining.
    new_row = row.copy()
    i = 0
    n = len(new_row)
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] == background:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] == background:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j  # Skip to after expansion
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The main `program` function integrates the above but is broken: it seeds only if merge and pair found, but applies seeding by setting to 8 only if background (good), yet spreads only on rows with original 8's (misses seeded rows); also, out = copy of subgrid before seeding, so seeding adds 8's but spreading check uses original g, leading to incomplete propagation. Not helpful as-is—needs fixing for vertical seeding to trigger spreading in all rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core logic for seeding and spreading is incomplete or misapplied.
 * In Training 1 (background likely 3): Generated correctly copied subgrid and detected bars/background, and spread some 8's in rows with original 8's (e.g., positions 8-9 filled consistently), but failed to seed additional 8's in columns 16-17 for top rows (expected has 8,8 there, generated has 3,3); also missed left-spreading in rows like index 9-11 (generated [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,8,8,...]) and full horizontal 8-band in rows 14-15 (generated partial 8,8 at 8-9, expected full 8's from 4-23). In bottom rows 16-18, no spreading issues as no 8's. Merge likely triggered (bar2/bar3=6?), but seeding used wrong pair or didn't apply vertically enough.
 * In Training 2 (background likely 1): Generated spread some 8's horizontally where original 8's present (e.g., row 5 has 8,8 at 8-9), and seeded nothing visibly, but expected shows seeding 8's at columns 4-5 and 8-9 early, plus a full 8-band in row 2 (positions 12-23), and left-spreading in row 4 (8's at 4-5,8-9,12-15?); generated missed vertical pillars (e.g., row 0 expected 8,8 at 4-5 but generated 1,1) and spreading in row 14 (expected full 8-band from 8-23, generated only 8,8 at 8-9). Merge triggered but initial pair detection failed or seeding didn't propagate spreading to non-original-8 rows.
 * In Training 3 (background likely 7): Generated spread 8's in some places (e.g., row 11 has full 8-band), but missed seeding 8's at columns 3-4 and 19-20 in top rows (expected 8,8 there vs generated 7,7); also incomplete vertical spreading (e.g., row 4 expected full 8-band from 0-13 vs generated partial 7's and 8,8 at 12-13); row 13 expected 8's at 3-4 and 12-13 with 6's preserved, but generated wrong. Bottom rows correct as no 8's. Merge triggered, but pair selection wrong (used existing 8's instead of specific merge positions).
 * extract_objects not present in attempts, but bar/background detection is essential and partially works; spread_row is helpful but broken for chaining full expansions and applying to seeded rows.
 * Common miss: Seeding doesn't trigger spreading in rows without original 8's; initial pair always picks first consecutive 8's, but expected suggests merge-specific positions (e.g., fixed columns or different pairs per example). Spreading doesn't handle vertical connections implicitly—needs per-row after seeding.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples. It shows heavy spreading of 8's in row 7 (full 8-band from 3-21?), but minimal elsewhere (e.g., top rows all 2's except bottom 3's, rows 3-5 all 9's, row 6 partial 1's then 9's, rows 8-10 full 8's but then back to 9's, row 16 full 9's, rows 17-18 partial 4's in middle). This mismatches expected behavior: if merge triggered (assuming bars include 6), we'd expect vertical 8-pillars seeding columns (e.g., 3-4 or similar) across all rows, then horizontal spreading into background (likely 9 or 2/3), creating more connected 8-regions (e.g., bands in top/mid rows like training); instead, it seems spreading only hit isolated rows, missing propagation (e.g., no 8's bleeding from row 7 to 6/8 fully, and bottom 4-block untouched but should spread if adjacent). No full bands in expected-like positions (e.g., row 14 in training 1/2), and abrupt shifts (e.g., row 6 has 1's at 0-2 then 9's, but row 7 jumps to 8's) suggest incomplete seeding or background misdetection. To handle test, need to apply spreading to ALL rows after seeding, not just original-8 rows, and possibly detect multiple seed pairs or fixed merge columns.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 21:36:17] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 24-column grid (likely 19 rows shown in outputs) where colored bars (extracted from the second row of the input grid) define protected zones, and sequences of 8's (representing a spreading "ink" or "flood" element) expand horizontally within their rows only under a specific merge condition (if bar 2 or 3 is color 6), stopping at protected colors or edges, while leaving other numbers (like 1,2,3,4, etc.) intact unless overwritten by the spread.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid g is a List[List[int]] with at least 25 rows (indices 0-24), but the output focuses on rows 6-24 (19 rows), copying them initially and modifying only where 8's are present.
 * Bar colors (1-4) are extracted from specific segments of row 1 (indices 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22), taking the first non-zero value in each; these bars act as blockers for spreading, along with color 5 (a universal protector, possibly a special barrier).
 * Spreading only activates if has_merge is true (bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6), indicating a "merge" event that allows 8's to propagate; without this, the grid is returned unchanged.
 * When spreading in a row with 8's: identify contiguous sequences of 8's, then expand left from the start and right from the end, overwriting non-protected cells (anything not in {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5}) until hitting a protected cell or edge; this must be done per row independently, and only affects rows containing at least one 8.
 * Subtlety: Spreading does not cross protected cells, even if they are not bars (e.g., stops at existing 1's or other numbers if they match protected set); it also doesn't spread vertically—only horizontal per row.
 * Easy to miss: The protected set is dynamic per puzzle (based on bars), and 0's in row 1 are ignored for bar extraction; spreading overwrites blanks or other fillable cells but preserves protected ones; in some cases, 8's appear to "connect" across gaps only if unprotected.
 * Other considerations: Grids have repeating rows (e.g., three identical rows of bars or fillers), suggesting vertical stacking or patterns; numbers like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 represent distinct colors/objects that shouldn't be altered unless spread into; the puzzle may involve "ink" filling regions bounded by bars, but only triggers on merge.
 * From examples: Spreading creates "blobs" of 8's that respect bar boundaries (e.g., in ex1, 8's fill between bars but stop at 1's/4's if protected); non-merge cases might do nothing; test input has 9's as a new color, possibly a bar or filler, and partial 8's that should spread if merge applies.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bar_colors(g):
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next(c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0)
    bar2 = next(c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0)
    bar3 = next(c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0)
    bar4 = next(c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts bar colors correctly from fixed positions in row 1, ignoring 0's; useful for defining protectors.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2, bar3):
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(This checks the merge condition accurately; essential to gate the spreading logic, as non-merge outputs should be unchanged.)

(The main program structure—copying rows 6:25, checking merge, defining protected set, and iterating rows for spreading—is a good skeleton, but the spreading implementation is flawed as detailed below. No types like classes are used, but a protected set is helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and extracts bar colors via get_bar_colors, which matches the positional logic seen in examples (e.g., bars at columns 1-4,7-10,etc., with non-zero first value).
 * has_merge works as a trigger, preventing changes in non-merge cases (though all examples seem to be merge cases).
 * The protected set {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5} is a good idea, capturing blockers like bars and a special 5.
 * However, spreading logic is broken: it over-spreads 8's across entire rows or sections, ignoring actual protected cells in the row (e.g., in train1, it fills huge swaths with 8's and even changes non-8 areas to 3's incorrectly, instead of stopping at existing 1's/4's; expected has isolated 8 pairs like positions 8-9 and 16-17).
 * In train1: Generated has full rows of 3's at top and massive 8 blocks in rows 7-8, but expected has targeted 8's (e.g., rows 0-2: 8's only at cols 8-9,16-17; row 9: 8's at 4-5,8-9 but stops before protected 3's/4's); difference is over-filling and wrong base colors (3's where 8's shouldn't go).
 * In train2: Generated spreads 8's too far in rows 8-9 (full blocks), but expected has more precise 8's (e.g., row 0: 8's at 4-5,8-9; row 2: wide 8's from col 13-21 but starting from existing); also fails to spread into some gaps (e.g., row 4 has no 8's in generated but expected has them); introduces wrong 1's in bar areas.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly fills with 7's in early rows and over-spreads 8's in row 11-12, but expected has 8's integrated with 7's as blockers (e.g., row 0: 8's at 3-4,18-19; row 4: full 8's but stopping at 7's); misses connecting 8's across minor gaps while respecting 7/6 bars.
 * Overall: Attempt demonstrates understanding of bars, merge, and horizontal spreading concept, but fails on precise boundary detection (spreads past existing protected numbers like 1/3/4/6/7 if they match set but doesn't check per-cell in row); the while loops for left/right spread use row[] for checks but new_row for writes, causing overwrite issues or skipping; no handling for multiple 8 sequences per row properly.
 * get_bar_colors and has_merge are helpful and correct—keep them; the spreading loop is unhelpful/broken (over-aggressive, doesn't preserve non-8 non-protected cells correctly, and mutates incorrectly)—avoid reusing as-is.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It mostly copies the input with minimal changes (e.g., rows 0-2 full of 2's unchanged; rows 3-6 full 9's; only partial 8's in row 7 at cols 8-10, but no spreading despite likely merge), resulting in isolated 8's and untouched 9's/4's, which mismatches the pattern of controlled 8 expansion seen in training expecteds (e.g., should spread 8's left/right from row 7's position 8-10 into adjacent 9's if unprotected, potentially filling between bars like cols 4-11 or similar, stopping at 1's or extracted bars; instead, it leaves most 9's intact and doesn't propagate, suggesting the merge check passed but spreading failed to activate/execute properly).
 * Differences: No wide 8 blobs as in training expecteds (e.g., expected likely has 8's expanding in rows 7+ to connect or fill regions bounded by 1's/9's/3's, especially row 17-18 where 4's are, possibly overwriting some 9's but not 1's/3's); the output feels like a near-copy with buggy partial 8 insert, missing the "flood" effect; 9's seem treated as non-protected but not filled, indicating the spread logic doesn't target them correctly.
 * To handle test: Ensure spreading checks every row with 8's (row 7 here), uses the correct protected set (bars likely 2/9/?/3 or similar from row 1, plus 5), and propagates only horizontally without altering non-8 rows; mentally, if bar2 or 3 is 6, 8's in row 7 should spread left to col 4 (stop at 1's?) and right to col 11 (stop at 9's if protected), creating a blob like [1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,...].

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the task is to overlay or insert a special color (8) to highlight or connect specific linear or banded patterns, likely representing outlines, borders, or extensions of existing colored regions across horizontal bands of similar rows. The goal is to transform the input grid by replacing background or gap cells with 8's in precise positions to form paired or extended lines, while preserving other colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of horizontal "bands" of identical or near-identical rows, and processing must group these bands to identify patterns like runs of non-background colors.
 * 8's are placed specifically to form short pairs (e.g., two consecutive 8's) or extend existing lines, often adjacent to non-background runs of width <=4, but only in certain directions (e.g., right of left-side runs or left of right-side runs), and sometimes filling full horizontal segments in stacked bands.
 * Background color (most common cell value) must be ignored when detecting runs; runs are sequences of the same non-background color.
 * Subtlety: 8's often appear in positions that "bridge" or outline shapes across bands, such as vertical alignments (e.g., columns 8-9 and 16-17 in train 1), but not always full rows—e.g., in train 1 row 9, 8's are interrupted by 3's in specific columns.
 * Another subtlety: In stacked bands, 8's can propagate vertically or fill entire row segments if aligned (e.g., full 8 rows in train 1 rows 7-8), but only where patterns match across bands; isolated bands don't get full fills.
 * Placement rules seem tied to grid width (e.g., references to column 12 suggest a 24-column grid midpoint), with left-side runs (start <12) extending right, and right-side runs extending left, but only if width conditions are met and color != background.
 * Easy to miss: Existing 8's in input should be preserved or extended, but new 8's only replace background; overfilling (e.g., replacing non-background with 8's) breaks the output.
 * Vertical alignment is key—8's must match column positions across multiple rows in a band for consistency (e.g., train 2 has 8 pairs in columns 4-5, 8-9, 14-15).
 * Bands may have interruptions (e.g., train 1 row 9 has 8's with 3's in between), so run detection must handle non-uniform rows within a "band" of mostly similar rows.
 * No vertical processing in current code—puzzle likely requires checking alignments across bands, not just within rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty or short grids return empty; top 6 rows seem ignored (header?); color 8 has special handling (e.g., width >=2 triggers pairs).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for ignoring it in run detection.)

```python
def get_bands(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    bands = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        j = i
        while j < n and grid[j] == grid[i]:
            j += 1
        pattern = grid[i]
        runs = []
        k = 0
        m = len(pattern)
        while k < m:
            if pattern[k] == get_background(grid):
                k += 1
                continue
            color = pattern[k]
            start = k
            while k < m and pattern[k] == color:
                k += 1
            end = k - 1
            width = end - start + 1
            runs.append((start, end, color, width))
        bands.append((i, j - i, runs))
        i = j
    return bands
```
(This groups identical rows into bands and extracts non-background runs with positions and widths, useful for identifying candidate line positions; however, it assumes perfectly identical rows in bands, which may not hold if rows have minor variations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (3 in train 1, 1 in train 2, 7 in train 3) and groups rows into bands, which works for detecting horizontal patterns.
 * Run extraction in get_bands skips background and captures widths/colors, helpful for spotting short runs (<=4) that might need extension.
 * find_line_pairs attempts to detect positions for 8 pairs based on color 8 (width>=2) or short non-bg runs, adding adjacent positions (e.g., right of left runs), which partially aligns with pair placements but fails to propagate vertically or fill aligned segments.
 * In program, it copies the grid and only replaces bg with 8's in rows with detected pairs, using min/max columns to fill segments— this overfills horizontally (e.g., full 8's from col 4-20 in train 1 row 7) instead of precise pairs.
 * Train 1 generated: Overfilled rows 7-8 and 9 with continuous 8's in cols 4-17, ignoring interruptions (expected has pairs at 8-9,16-17 with 3's elsewhere; also missed upper pairs and lower extensions like row 12-15).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Rows 0-2 all 3's (correct, no change), but rows 3-6 should have pairs starting at row 3, not just lower; row 9 has full 8's instead of interrupted (8,8,3,3,8,8,3,3); rows 12-15 missed entirely (expected 8 pairs); bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 2 generated: Filled cols 4-15 with 8's in rows 7-8 and 10, but expected has pairs at specific columns (4-5,8-9,14-15) across more rows (e.g., rows 0-1,3-4,5-8,9-10); missed vertical extensions in row 2 (full 8's cols 14-21); row 14 has full 8's cols 8-21 (wrong, expected pairs).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper rows 0-1 have no 8's (expected pairs); row 2 all 1's (expected long 8's); rows 11-12 missed pairs; bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 3 generated: Filled cols 3-19 with 8's in rows 11-12, but expected has more distributed pairs (e.g., cols 3-4,13-14 in upper rows); rows 4-7 all 7's (missed 8 extensions); row 16 has 8's only in detected band (wrong positions).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Rows 0-2 have 3's unchanged (expected pairs at 3-4,18-19); rows 4-6 all 7's (expected full 8's cols 0-7,19-20); row 6 has partial (expected more); rows 13-15 missed pairs and full 8's; function assumes exact row equality for bands, but train 3 row 6 differs slightly from above.
 * Overall, program ignores vertical alignment across bands, leading to no propagation (e.g., no 8's in upper bands of train 1); line_pairs only adds single adjacent cells, not pairs or fills.
 * find_line_pairs is broken/not helpful: It adds (start, start+1) for color 8 width>=2 (but start is run start, so wrong positions); for other runs, adds single cells adjacent but not pairs, and only if start<12 or end>11 (midpoint logic partial but incomplete); doesn't handle full fills or interruptions.
 * get_bands is mostly helpful but skips bg in runs correctly; however, doesn't handle near-identical bands (e.g., if rows differ by 1 cell).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills large horizontal segments with 8's (e.g., rows 7-9 cols 3-20 full 8's, row 13 cols 3-20 full 9's unchanged but should likely get pairs) instead of precise pairs or aligned extensions, similar to training errors.
 * In test, top rows 0-2 all 2's (likely correct, no change); rows 3-5 all 9's (correct); row 6 has 1's in cols 0-2 then 9's (partial, but expected probably 8 pairs around the 1's); rows 7-9 overfilled with 8's across most cols (expected pairs like cols 3-4, perhaps 12-13 based on pattern); rows 10-12 1's then 9's (missed 8's); rows 13-15 full 9's in cols 3+ (wrong, likely need pairs); rows 16-17 all 9's (correct?); rows 18-20 have 4's in cols 7-15 (unchanged, but may need 8 outlines); bottom all 9's (correct). It ignores vertical patterns (e.g., the left 1's in rows 6-12 suggest a vertical shape needing 8 borders on right).
 * No vertical propagation: The 1's on left in rows 6-12 align vertically, likely needing 8 pairs to the right (e.g., cols 3-4), but output only fills in row 7-9 band; bottom 4's band unchanged despite being a distinct run.
 * Overfilling bg with 8's in detected bands, but test has bg=9 (most common), so runs of 2/1/4 should trigger specific pair placements, not full rows; misses potential full 8 rows if aligned across bands (none here, but code doesn't check).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to generate a modified version of a subgrid (rows 6-24) by spreading a special "ink" or filler (value 8) from initial seeds or patterns, influenced by background color detection, vertical bars with specific colors (like 6 indicating merges), and rules for expanding 8's into adjacent background cells while preserving other structures like colored blocks or bars.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a background color (most common value across the entire input grid), which 8's can spread into horizontally in affected rows, but only adjacent to existing 8's or seeds; spreading does not overwrite non-background cells (e.g., colored blocks like 1's, 3's, 4's, or bars).
 * Vertical bars (likely in fixed columns like 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22 based on code attempts) have colors that trigger rules: a bar color of 6 in bar2 or bar3 indicates a "merge" mode, which seeds additional 8's in specific column pairs across all output rows where the background is present.
 * Initial seeds for 8's come from finding consecutive 8's (length >=2) in the input subgrid rows; during merge, seed two adjacent columns (e.g., start and start+1 of the first such pair found) with 8's in all rows if those positions are background.
 * Spreading of 8's is horizontal only, expanding left/right from clusters of 8's into background, but only applied to rows that originally contain at least one 8 in the input; this can create filled horizontal bands or connect sections.
 * Subtleties: Merges create vertical "pillars" of 8's that then spread horizontally in subsequent rows; not all rows spread equally—some expected outputs show partial spreading (e.g., only left or right sides), and 8's can form large connected blobs vertically/horizontally but respect block boundaries. Bars and blocks (e.g., sequences of same color like 1's or 4's) must not be overwritten. In non-merge cases, spreading might be minimal or absent. Easy to miss: seed positions are column-based across all rows, but spreading is per-row; background detection uses the whole grid, including non-subgrid rows. Also, 8's in input might already be present, and spreading should chain (e.g., fill gaps between multiple 8 clusters in a row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where initial pair is not found (return None, no seeding); spreading must skip over non-background (e.g., don't spread into a 4-block); vertical alignment of 8's from seeding must propagate spreading in lower rows; in merge, seeding happens before spreading, and only in background positions.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The main `program` function integrates the above but is broken: it seeds only if merge and pair found, but applies seeding by setting to 8 only if background (good), yet spreads only on rows with original 8's (misses seeded rows); also, out = copy of subgrid before seeding, so seeding adds 8's but spreading check uses original g, leading to incomplete propagation. Not helpful as-is—needs fixing for vertical seeding to trigger spreading in all rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core logic for seeding and spreading is incomplete or misapplied.
 * In Training 1 (background likely 3): Generated correctly copied subgrid and detected bars/background, and spread some 8's in rows with original 8's (e.g., positions 8-9 filled consistently), but failed to seed additional 8's in columns 16-17 for top rows (expected has 8,8 there, generated has 3,3); also missed left-spreading in rows like index 9-11 (generated [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,8,8,...]) and full horizontal 8-band in rows 14-15 (generated partial 8,8 at 8-9, expected full 8's from 4-23). In bottom rows 16-18, no spreading issues as no 8's. Merge likely triggered (bar2/bar3=6?), but seeding used wrong pair or didn't apply vertically enough.
 * In Training 2 (background likely 1): Generated spread some 8's horizontally where original 8's present (e.g., row 5 has 8,8 at 8-9), and seeded nothing visibly, but expected shows seeding 8's at columns 4-5 and 8-9 early, plus a full 8-band in row 2 (positions 12-23), and left-spreading in row 4 (8's at 4-5,8-9,12-15?); generated missed vertical pillars (e.g., row 0 expected 8,8 at 4-5 but generated 1,1) and spreading in row 14 (expected full 8-band from 8-23, generated only 8,8 at 8-9). Merge triggered but initial pair detection failed or seeding didn't propagate spreading to non-original-8 rows.
 * In Training 3 (background likely 7): Generated spread 8's in some places (e.g., row 11 has full 8-band), but missed seeding 8's at columns 3-4 and 19-20 in top rows (expected 8,8 there vs generated 7,7); also incomplete vertical spreading (e.g., row 4 expected full 8-band from 0-13 vs generated partial 7's and 8,8 at 12-13); row 13 expected 8's at 3-4 and 12-13 with 6's preserved, but generated wrong. Bottom rows correct as no 8's. Merge triggered, but pair selection wrong (used existing 8's instead of specific merge positions).
 * extract_objects not present in attempts, but bar/background detection is essential and partially works; spread_row is helpful but broken for chaining full expansions and applying to seeded rows.
 * Common miss: Seeding doesn't trigger spreading in rows without original 8's; initial pair always picks first consecutive 8's, but expected suggests merge-specific positions (e.g., fixed columns or different pairs per example). Spreading doesn't handle vertical connections implicitly—needs per-row after seeding.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples. It shows heavy spreading of 8's in row 7 (full 8-band from 3-21?), but minimal elsewhere (e.g., top rows all 2's except bottom 3's, rows 3-5 all 9's, row 6 partial 1's then 9's, rows 8-10 full 8's but then back to 9's, row 16 full 9's, rows 17-18 partial 4's in middle). This mismatches expected behavior: if merge triggered (assuming bars include 6), we'd expect vertical 8-pillars seeding columns (e.g., 3-4 or similar) across all rows, then horizontal spreading into background (likely 9 or 2/3), creating more connected 8-regions (e.g., bands in top/mid rows like training); instead, it seems spreading only hit isolated rows, missing propagation (e.g., no 8's bleeding from row 7 to 6/8 fully, and bottom 4-block untouched but should spread if adjacent). No full bands in expected-like positions (e.g., row 14 in training 1/2), and abrupt shifts (e.g., row 6 has 1's at 0-2 then 9's, but row 7 jumps to 8's) suggest incomplete seeding or background misdetection. To handle test, need to apply spreading to ALL rows after seeding, not just original-8 rows, and possibly detect multiple seed pairs or fixed merge columns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 21:51:35] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the number 8 (likely representing a spreading "ink" or fill) must be propagated or "spread" across certain rows in a subgrid (rows 6-24 of a larger grid), while respecting barriers defined by colored bars, protected cells, and special merge conditions. The goal is to transform the input grid by filling unprotected areas with 8s based on initial seeds or pairs, but avoiding overwriting specific colors or structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a header row (g[1]) with bar colors in specific segments (e.g., columns 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22, skipping zeros), which define protected colors that 8s cannot overwrite during spreading.
 * Protected set includes bar colors plus 5 (possibly a universal barrier or empty space indicator).
 * Merge condition triggers only if bar2 or bar3 is 6, potentially allowing special placement of initial 8 pairs in rows without existing 8s.
 * Initial pair detection looks for the first consecutive pair of 8s (count >=2) in subgrid rows, but placement is conditional on merge and only in rows lacking any 8s originally; however, this seems overly restrictive and doesn't propagate the pair across rows.
 * Spreading function expands contiguous 8s left/right until hitting protected cells or grid edges, but only applied to rows that originally contain 8s; it skips rows without 8s except via the pair logic.
 * Subtleties: Spreading is row-wise only (no vertical propagation), and initial seeds might need to be placed or detected differently—e.g., pairs may indicate starting points for vertical or multi-row fills. Protected cells block but don't get filled. Bars might represent dividers that 8s can't cross vertically or horizontally. In examples, 8s often form blobs or lines that align with non-protected areas, suggesting connected component filling. Easy to miss: Some rows need 8s inserted even without originals if they align with vertical continuity from above/below; merge=6 might enable crossing a central barrier. Original 8s must be preserved and expanded, but not all empty (0 or other) cells get filled—only those adjacent to 8s. Grid is 19 rows deep for subgrid, but spreading doesn't handle multi-row connectivity well.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)
    bar2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    bar3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    bar4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts the four bar colors correctly from header, useful for defining protected sets.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2: int, bar3: int) -> bool:
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(Simple but key for detecting special merge cases that allow extra 8 placements.)

```python
def spread_row(row: List[int], protected: set) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row.copy()
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This performs horizontal spreading from existing 8 blocks, avoiding protected; core logic for expansion but limited to single rows and doesn't handle vertical.)

```python
def get_initial_pair(g: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for row in g[6:25]:
        i = 0
        n = len(row)
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == 8:
                start = i
                count = 0
                while i < n and row[i] == 8:
                    i += 1
                    count += 1
                if count >= 2:
                    return (start, start + 1)
            else:
                i += 1
    return None
```
(Detects first pair of consecutive 8s for seeding, but returns only positions in one row; useful but incomplete as it doesn't propagate vertically or check all rows.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating the core spreading and seeding logic is flawed—e.g., it under-fills 8s in areas that should connect vertically or across barriers under merge conditions.
 * Train 1: Generated spread 8s correctly in some central rows (e.g., full 8s in rows 7-8 matching expected), but failed to place 8s in right-side positions (e.g., expected 8,8 in columns 16-17 for top rows, but generated 3,3; also missed vertical extension in rows 9-11 where expected 8,8 in cols 4-5 but generated 3,3; row 14 has no 8s in cols 4-7 where expected full 8s). Pair placement didn't trigger properly, and spreading didn't extend to non-original-8 rows. What worked: Protected 3 and 4 areas correctly; horizontal spreads in seeded rows.
 * Train 2: Generated initial 8,8 pairs in cols 8-9 correctly for top rows, but missed left-side 8s in cols 4-5 (expected 8,8 but generated 1,1); row 2 expected 8s in cols 14-21 but generated 6s/1s; central merge (bar3=6?) not handled to fill row 2 cols 14-21 with 8s; bottom rows under-filled (e.g., row 14 expected full 8s cols 8-23 but generated partial). What worked: Spread in row 8-9 full 8s; protected 1,3,6 areas. Pair detection missed or not applied vertically.
 * Train 3: Generated some 8 spreads (e.g., cols 12-13 in middle rows), but missed left extensions (e.g., top rows expected 8,8 in cols 3-4 but generated 7,7; row 4 expected 8,8 cols 3-4 but generated 7,7); row 5 over-filled with 7s where expected 8s cols 0-11; vertical blobs not connected (e.g., row 14 expected 8s cols 20-23 but generated 6s). What worked: Right-side 6 protections; some horizontal spreads in row 11-12. Merge (bar4=6?) not enabling cross-bar fills.
 * get_initial_pair is helpful for seeding but broken in application—only places in one row and only if no original 8s, missing vertical propagation; don't rely on it alone.
 * has_eight (checks if 8 in row) is simple but useful for identifying seed rows; however, the main program logic skips spreading on non-seed rows too aggressively.
 * Overall, attempts show understanding of bars/protected but fail on vertical connectivity, merge-enabled fills across central areas (e.g., when bar=6, 8s might bridge gaps), and inserting seeds in empty rows based on alignment rather than single pair.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it over-fills with 9s in many areas (e.g., rows 3-6 full 9s where 8s should spread instead, assuming 9 is a bar color but spreading logic treated it wrong); row 7 has 1s in cols 0-2 then full 8s, but if vertical from above, more 8s expected in left; rows 13-16 full 9s bottom-right, but spreading should stop at protected 3s in cols 21-23; row 17 full 9s, row 18 partial 4s in center but no 8s where seeds might start. It ignores potential vertical 8 propagation from row 7-10's 8s downward, and pair/merge not detected (no initial 8 pair found?). This suggests the program didn't extract bars correctly (bars seem 2 left, 9 center/right, 3/4 bottom), leading to wrong protected set; output looks like it copied input without proper 8 spreading, making it incoherent for a fill puzzle.

[2025-10-01 21:51:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 24-column grid (likely 19 rows shown in outputs) where colored bars (extracted from the second row of the input grid) define protected zones, and sequences of 8's (representing a spreading "ink" or "flood" element) expand horizontally within their rows only under a specific merge condition (if bar 2 or 3 is color 6), stopping at protected colors or edges, while leaving other numbers (like 1,2,3,4, etc.) intact unless overwritten by the spread.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid g is a List[List[int]] with at least 25 rows (indices 0-24), but the output focuses on rows 6-24 (19 rows), copying them initially and modifying only where 8's are present.
 * Bar colors (1-4) are extracted from specific segments of row 1 (indices 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22), taking the first non-zero value in each; these bars act as blockers for spreading, along with color 5 (a universal protector, possibly a special barrier).
 * Spreading only activates if has_merge is true (bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6), indicating a "merge" event that allows 8's to propagate; without this, the grid is returned unchanged.
 * When spreading in a row with 8's: identify contiguous sequences of 8's, then expand left from the start and right from the end, overwriting non-protected cells (anything not in {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5}) until hitting a protected cell or edge; this must be done per row independently, and only affects rows containing at least one 8.
 * Subtlety: Spreading does not cross protected cells, even if they are not bars (e.g., stops at existing 1's or other numbers if they match protected set); it also doesn't spread vertically—only horizontal per row.
 * Easy to miss: The protected set is dynamic per puzzle (based on bars), and 0's in row 1 are ignored for bar extraction; spreading overwrites blanks or other fillable cells but preserves protected ones; in some cases, 8's appear to "connect" across gaps only if unprotected.
 * Other considerations: Grids have repeating rows (e.g., three identical rows of bars or fillers), suggesting vertical stacking or patterns; numbers like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 represent distinct colors/objects that shouldn't be altered unless spread into; the puzzle may involve "ink" filling regions bounded by bars, but only triggers on merge.
 * From examples: Spreading creates "blobs" of 8's that respect bar boundaries (e.g., in ex1, 8's fill between bars but stop at 1's/4's if protected); non-merge cases might do nothing; test input has 9's as a new color, possibly a bar or filler, and partial 8's that should spread if merge applies.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bar_colors(g):
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next(c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0)
    bar2 = next(c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0)
    bar3 = next(c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0)
    bar4 = next(c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts bar colors correctly from fixed positions in row 1, ignoring 0's; useful for defining protectors.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2, bar3):
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(This checks the merge condition accurately; essential to gate the spreading logic, as non-merge outputs should be unchanged.)

(The main program structure—copying rows 6:25, checking merge, defining protected set, and iterating rows for spreading—is a good skeleton, but the spreading implementation is flawed as detailed below. No types like classes are used, but a protected set is helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and extracts bar colors via get_bar_colors, which matches the positional logic seen in examples (e.g., bars at columns 1-4,7-10,etc., with non-zero first value).
 * has_merge works as a trigger, preventing changes in non-merge cases (though all examples seem to be merge cases).
 * The protected set {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5} is a good idea, capturing blockers like bars and a special 5.
 * However, spreading logic is broken: it over-spreads 8's across entire rows or sections, ignoring actual protected cells in the row (e.g., in train1, it fills huge swaths with 8's and even changes non-8 areas to 3's incorrectly, instead of stopping at existing 1's/4's; expected has isolated 8 pairs like positions 8-9 and 16-17).
 * In train1: Generated has full rows of 3's at top and massive 8 blocks in rows 7-8, but expected has targeted 8's (e.g., rows 0-2: 8's only at cols 8-9,16-17; row 9: 8's at 4-5,8-9 but stops before protected 3's/4's); difference is over-filling and wrong base colors (3's where 8's shouldn't go).
 * In train2: Generated spreads 8's too far in rows 8-9 (full blocks), but expected has more precise 8's (e.g., row 0: 8's at 4-5,8-9; row 2: wide 8's from col 13-21 but starting from existing); also fails to spread into some gaps (e.g., row 4 has no 8's in generated but expected has them); introduces wrong 1's in bar areas.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly fills with 7's in early rows and over-spreads 8's in row 11-12, but expected has 8's integrated with 7's as blockers (e.g., row 0: 8's at 3-4,18-19; row 4: full 8's but stopping at 7's); misses connecting 8's across minor gaps while respecting 7/6 bars.
 * Overall: Attempt demonstrates understanding of bars, merge, and horizontal spreading concept, but fails on precise boundary detection (spreads past existing protected numbers like 1/3/4/6/7 if they match set but doesn't check per-cell in row); the while loops for left/right spread use row[] for checks but new_row for writes, causing overwrite issues or skipping; no handling for multiple 8 sequences per row properly.
 * get_bar_colors and has_merge are helpful and correct—keep them; the spreading loop is unhelpful/broken (over-aggressive, doesn't preserve non-8 non-protected cells correctly, and mutates incorrectly)—avoid reusing as-is.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It mostly copies the input with minimal changes (e.g., rows 0-2 full of 2's unchanged; rows 3-6 full 9's; only partial 8's in row 7 at cols 8-10, but no spreading despite likely merge), resulting in isolated 8's and untouched 9's/4's, which mismatches the pattern of controlled 8 expansion seen in training expecteds (e.g., should spread 8's left/right from row 7's position 8-10 into adjacent 9's if unprotected, potentially filling between bars like cols 4-11 or similar, stopping at 1's or extracted bars; instead, it leaves most 9's intact and doesn't propagate, suggesting the merge check passed but spreading failed to activate/execute properly).
 * Differences: No wide 8 blobs as in training expecteds (e.g., expected likely has 8's expanding in rows 7+ to connect or fill regions bounded by 1's/9's/3's, especially row 17-18 where 4's are, possibly overwriting some 9's but not 1's/3's); the output feels like a near-copy with buggy partial 8 insert, missing the "flood" effect; 9's seem treated as non-protected but not filled, indicating the spread logic doesn't target them correctly.
 * To handle test: Ensure spreading checks every row with 8's (row 7 here), uses the correct protected set (bars likely 2/9/?/3 or similar from row 1, plus 5), and propagates only horizontally without altering non-8 rows; mentally, if bar2 or 3 is 6, 8's in row 7 should spread left to col 4 (stop at 1's?) and right to col 11 (stop at 9's if protected), creating a blob like [1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,...].

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the task is to overlay or insert a special color (8) to highlight or connect specific linear or banded patterns, likely representing outlines, borders, or extensions of existing colored regions across horizontal bands of similar rows. The goal is to transform the input grid by replacing background or gap cells with 8's in precise positions to form paired or extended lines, while preserving other colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of horizontal "bands" of identical or near-identical rows, and processing must group these bands to identify patterns like runs of non-background colors.
 * 8's are placed specifically to form short pairs (e.g., two consecutive 8's) or extend existing lines, often adjacent to non-background runs of width <=4, but only in certain directions (e.g., right of left-side runs or left of right-side runs), and sometimes filling full horizontal segments in stacked bands.
 * Background color (most common cell value) must be ignored when detecting runs; runs are sequences of the same non-background color.
 * Subtlety: 8's often appear in positions that "bridge" or outline shapes across bands, such as vertical alignments (e.g., columns 8-9 and 16-17 in train 1), but not always full rows—e.g., in train 1 row 9, 8's are interrupted by 3's in specific columns.
 * Another subtlety: In stacked bands, 8's can propagate vertically or fill entire row segments if aligned (e.g., full 8 rows in train 1 rows 7-8), but only where patterns match across bands; isolated bands don't get full fills.
 * Placement rules seem tied to grid width (e.g., references to column 12 suggest a 24-column grid midpoint), with left-side runs (start <12) extending right, and right-side runs extending left, but only if width conditions are met and color != background.
 * Easy to miss: Existing 8's in input should be preserved or extended, but new 8's only replace background; overfilling (e.g., replacing non-background with 8's) breaks the output.
 * Vertical alignment is key—8's must match column positions across multiple rows in a band for consistency (e.g., train 2 has 8 pairs in columns 4-5, 8-9, 14-15).
 * Bands may have interruptions (e.g., train 1 row 9 has 8's with 3's in between), so run detection must handle non-uniform rows within a "band" of mostly similar rows.
 * No vertical processing in current code—puzzle likely requires checking alignments across bands, not just within rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty or short grids return empty; top 6 rows seem ignored (header?); color 8 has special handling (e.g., width >=2 triggers pairs).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for ignoring it in run detection.)

```python
def get_bands(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    bands = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        j = i
        while j < n and grid[j] == grid[i]:
            j += 1
        pattern = grid[i]
        runs = []
        k = 0
        m = len(pattern)
        while k < m:
            if pattern[k] == get_background(grid):
                k += 1
                continue
            color = pattern[k]
            start = k
            while k < m and pattern[k] == color:
                k += 1
            end = k - 1
            width = end - start + 1
            runs.append((start, end, color, width))
        bands.append((i, j - i, runs))
        i = j
    return bands
```
(This groups identical rows into bands and extracts non-background runs with positions and widths, useful for identifying candidate line positions; however, it assumes perfectly identical rows in bands, which may not hold if rows have minor variations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (3 in train 1, 1 in train 2, 7 in train 3) and groups rows into bands, which works for detecting horizontal patterns.
 * Run extraction in get_bands skips background and captures widths/colors, helpful for spotting short runs (<=4) that might need extension.
 * find_line_pairs attempts to detect positions for 8 pairs based on color 8 (width>=2) or short non-bg runs, adding adjacent positions (e.g., right of left runs), which partially aligns with pair placements but fails to propagate vertically or fill aligned segments.
 * In program, it copies the grid and only replaces bg with 8's in rows with detected pairs, using min/max columns to fill segments— this overfills horizontally (e.g., full 8's from col 4-20 in train 1 row 7) instead of precise pairs.
 * Train 1 generated: Overfilled rows 7-8 and 9 with continuous 8's in cols 4-17, ignoring interruptions (expected has pairs at 8-9,16-17 with 3's elsewhere; also missed upper pairs and lower extensions like row 12-15).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Rows 0-2 all 3's (correct, no change), but rows 3-6 should have pairs starting at row 3, not just lower; row 9 has full 8's instead of interrupted (8,8,3,3,8,8,3,3); rows 12-15 missed entirely (expected 8 pairs); bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 2 generated: Filled cols 4-15 with 8's in rows 7-8 and 10, but expected has pairs at specific columns (4-5,8-9,14-15) across more rows (e.g., rows 0-1,3-4,5-8,9-10); missed vertical extensions in row 2 (full 8's cols 14-21); row 14 has full 8's cols 8-21 (wrong, expected pairs).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper rows 0-1 have no 8's (expected pairs); row 2 all 1's (expected long 8's); rows 11-12 missed pairs; bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 3 generated: Filled cols 3-19 with 8's in rows 11-12, but expected has more distributed pairs (e.g., cols 3-4,13-14 in upper rows); rows 4-7 all 7's (missed 8 extensions); row 16 has 8's only in detected band (wrong positions).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Rows 0-2 have 3's unchanged (expected pairs at 3-4,18-19); rows 4-6 all 7's (expected full 8's cols 0-7,19-20); row 6 has partial (expected more); rows 13-15 missed pairs and full 8's; function assumes exact row equality for bands, but train 3 row 6 differs slightly from above.
 * Overall, program ignores vertical alignment across bands, leading to no propagation (e.g., no 8's in upper bands of train 1); line_pairs only adds single adjacent cells, not pairs or fills.
 * find_line_pairs is broken/not helpful: It adds (start, start+1) for color 8 width>=2 (but start is run start, so wrong positions); for other runs, adds single cells adjacent but not pairs, and only if start<12 or end>11 (midpoint logic partial but incomplete); doesn't handle full fills or interruptions.
 * get_bands is mostly helpful but skips bg in runs correctly; however, doesn't handle near-identical bands (e.g., if rows differ by 1 cell).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills large horizontal segments with 8's (e.g., rows 7-9 cols 3-20 full 8's, row 13 cols 3-20 full 9's unchanged but should likely get pairs) instead of precise pairs or aligned extensions, similar to training errors.
 * In test, top rows 0-2 all 2's (likely correct, no change); rows 3-5 all 9's (correct); row 6 has 1's in cols 0-2 then 9's (partial, but expected probably 8 pairs around the 1's); rows 7-9 overfilled with 8's across most cols (expected pairs like cols 3-4, perhaps 12-13 based on pattern); rows 10-12 1's then 9's (missed 8's); rows 13-15 full 9's in cols 3+ (wrong, likely need pairs); rows 16-17 all 9's (correct?); rows 18-20 have 4's in cols 7-15 (unchanged, but may need 8 outlines); bottom all 9's (correct). It ignores vertical patterns (e.g., the left 1's in rows 6-12 suggest a vertical shape needing 8 borders on right).
 * No vertical propagation: The 1's on left in rows 6-12 align vertically, likely needing 8 pairs to the right (e.g., cols 3-4), but output only fills in row 7-9 band; bottom 4's band unchanged despite being a distinct run.
 * Overfilling bg with 8's in detected bands, but test has bg=9 (most common), so runs of 2/1/4 should trigger specific pair placements, not full rows; misses potential full 8 rows if aligned across bands (none here, but code doesn't check).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to generate a modified version of a subgrid (rows 6-24) by spreading a special "ink" or filler (value 8) from initial seeds or patterns, influenced by background color detection, vertical bars with specific colors (like 6 indicating merges), and rules for expanding 8's into adjacent background cells while preserving other structures like colored blocks or bars.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a background color (most common value across the entire input grid), which 8's can spread into horizontally in affected rows, but only adjacent to existing 8's or seeds; spreading does not overwrite non-background cells (e.g., colored blocks like 1's, 3's, 4's, or bars).
 * Vertical bars (likely in fixed columns like 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22 based on code attempts) have colors that trigger rules: a bar color of 6 in bar2 or bar3 indicates a "merge" mode, which seeds additional 8's in specific column pairs across all output rows where the background is present.
 * Initial seeds for 8's come from finding consecutive 8's (length >=2) in the input subgrid rows; during merge, seed two adjacent columns (e.g., start and start+1 of the first such pair found) with 8's in all rows if those positions are background.
 * Spreading of 8's is horizontal only, expanding left/right from clusters of 8's into background, but only applied to rows that originally contain at least one 8 in the input; this can create filled horizontal bands or connect sections.
 * Subtleties: Merges create vertical "pillars" of 8's that then spread horizontally in subsequent rows; not all rows spread equally—some expected outputs show partial spreading (e.g., only left or right sides), and 8's can form large connected blobs vertically/horizontally but respect block boundaries. Bars and blocks (e.g., sequences of same color like 1's or 4's) must not be overwritten. In non-merge cases, spreading might be minimal or absent. Easy to miss: seed positions are column-based across all rows, but spreading is per-row; background detection uses the whole grid, including non-subgrid rows. Also, 8's in input might already be present, and spreading should chain (e.g., fill gaps between multiple 8 clusters in a row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where initial pair is not found (return None, no seeding); spreading must skip over non-background (e.g., don't spread into a 4-block); vertical alignment of 8's from seeding must propagate spreading in lower rows; in merge, seeding happens before spreading, and only in background positions.

        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The main `program` function integrates the above but is broken: it seeds only if merge and pair found, but applies seeding by setting to 8 only if background (good), yet spreads only on rows with original 8's (misses seeded rows); also, out = copy of subgrid before seeding, so seeding adds 8's but spreading check uses original g, leading to incomplete propagation. Not helpful as-is—needs fixing for vertical seeding to trigger spreading in all rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core logic for seeding and spreading is incomplete or misapplied.
 * In Training 1 (background likely 3): Generated correctly copied subgrid and detected bars/background, and spread some 8's in rows with original 8's (e.g., positions 8-9 filled consistently), but failed to seed additional 8's in columns 16-17 for top rows (expected has 8,8 there, generated has 3,3); also missed left-spreading in rows like index 9-11 (generated [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,8,8,...]) and full horizontal 8-band in rows 14-15 (generated partial 8,8 at 8-9, expected full 8's from 4-23). In bottom rows 16-18, no spreading issues as no 8's. Merge likely triggered (bar2/bar3=6?), but seeding used wrong pair or didn't apply vertically enough.
 * In Training 2 (background likely 1): Generated spread some 8's horizontally where original 8's present (e.g., row 5 has 8,8 at 8-9), and seeded nothing visibly, but expected shows seeding 8's at columns 4-5 and 8-9 early, plus a full 8-band in row 2 (positions 12-23), and left-spreading in row 4 (8's at 4-5,8-9,12-15?); generated missed vertical pillars (e.g., row 0 expected 8,8 at 4-5 but generated 1,1) and spreading in row 14 (expected full 8-band from 8-23, generated only 8,8 at 8-9). Merge triggered but initial pair detection failed or seeding didn't propagate spreading to non-original-8 rows.
 * In Training 3 (background likely 7): Generated spread 8's in some places (e.g., row 11 has full 8-band), but missed seeding 8's at columns 3-4 and 19-20 in top rows (expected 8,8 there vs generated 7,7); also incomplete vertical spreading (e.g., row 4 expected full 8-band from 0-13 vs generated partial 7's and 8,8 at 12-13); row 13 expected 8's at 3-4 and 12-13 with 6's preserved, but generated wrong. Bottom rows correct as no 8's. Merge triggered, but pair selection wrong (used existing 8's instead of specific merge positions).
 * extract_objects not present in attempts, but bar/background detection is essential and partially works; spread_row is helpful but broken for chaining full expansions and applying to seeded rows.
 * Common miss: Seeding doesn't trigger spreading in rows without original 8's; initial pair always picks first consecutive 8's, but expected suggests merge-specific positions (e.g., fixed columns or different pairs per example). Spreading doesn't handle vertical connections implicitly—needs per-row after seeding.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples. It shows heavy spreading of 8's in row 7 (full 8-band from 3-21?), but minimal elsewhere (e.g., top rows all 2's except bottom 3's, rows 3-5 all 9's, row 6 partial 1's then 9's, rows 8-10 full 8's but then back to 9's, row 16 full 9's, rows 17-18 partial 4's in middle). This mismatches expected behavior: if merge triggered (assuming bars include 6), we'd expect vertical 8-pillars seeding columns (e.g., 3-4 or similar) across all rows, then horizontal spreading into background (likely 9 or 2/3), creating more connected 8-regions (e.g., bands in top/mid rows like training); instead, it seems spreading only hit isolated rows, missing propagation (e.g., no 8's bleeding from row 7 to 6/8 fully, and bottom 4-block untouched but should spread if adjacent). No full bands in expected-like positions (e.g., row 14 in training 1/2), and abrupt shifts (e.g., row 6 has 1's at 0-2 then 9's, but row 7 jumps to 8's) suggest incomplete seeding or background misdetection. To handle test, need to apply spreading to ALL rows after seeding, not just original-8 rows, and possibly detect multiple seed pairs or fixed merge columns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the number 8 (likely representing a spreading "ink" or fill) must be propagated or "spread" across certain rows in a subgrid (rows 6-24 of a larger grid), while respecting barriers defined by colored bars, protected cells, and special merge conditions. The goal is to transform the input grid by filling unprotected areas with 8s based on initial seeds or pairs, but avoiding overwriting specific colors or structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a header row (g[1]) with bar colors in specific segments (e.g., columns 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22, skipping zeros), which define protected colors that 8s cannot overwrite during spreading.
 * Protected set includes bar colors plus 5 (possibly a universal barrier or empty space indicator).
 * Merge condition triggers only if bar2 or bar3 is 6, potentially allowing special placement of initial 8 pairs in rows without existing 8s.
 * Initial pair detection looks for the first consecutive pair of 8s (count >=2) in subgrid rows, but placement is conditional on merge and only in rows lacking any 8s originally; however, this seems overly restrictive and doesn't propagate the pair across rows.
 * Spreading function expands contiguous 8s left/right until hitting protected cells or grid edges, but only applied to rows that originally contain 8s; it skips rows without 8s except via the pair logic.
 * Subtleties: Spreading is row-wise only (no vertical propagation), and initial seeds might need to be placed or detected differently—e.g., pairs may indicate starting points for vertical or multi-row fills. Protected cells block but don't get filled. Bars might represent dividers that 8s can't cross vertically or horizontally. In examples, 8s often form blobs or lines that align with non-protected areas, suggesting connected component filling. Easy to miss: Some rows need 8s inserted even without originals if they align with vertical continuity from above/below; merge=6 might enable crossing a central barrier. Original 8s must be preserved and expanded, but not all empty (0 or other) cells get filled—only those adjacent to 8s. Grid is 19 rows deep for subgrid, but spreading doesn't handle multi-row connectivity well.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)
    bar2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    bar3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    bar4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts the four bar colors correctly from header, useful for defining protected sets.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2: int, bar3: int) -> bool:
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(Simple but key for detecting special merge cases that allow extra 8 placements.)

```python
def spread_row(row: List[int], protected: set) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row.copy()
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This performs horizontal spreading from existing 8 blocks, avoiding protected; core logic for expansion but limited to single rows and doesn't handle vertical.)

```python
def get_initial_pair(g: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for row in g[6:25]:
        i = 0
        n = len(row)
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == 8:
                start = i
                count = 0
                while i < n and row[i] == 8:
                    i += 1
                    count += 1
                if count >= 2:
                    return (start, start + 1)
            else:
                i += 1
    return None
```
(Detects first pair of consecutive 8s for seeding, but returns only positions in one row; useful but incomplete as it doesn't propagate vertically or check all rows.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating the core spreading and seeding logic is flawed—e.g., it under-fills 8s in areas that should connect vertically or across barriers under merge conditions.
 * Train 1: Generated spread 8s correctly in some central rows (e.g., full 8s in rows 7-8 matching expected), but failed to place 8s in right-side positions (e.g., expected 8,8 in columns 16-17 for top rows, but generated 3,3; also missed vertical extension in rows 9-11 where expected 8,8 in cols 4-5 but generated 3,3; row 14 has no 8s in cols 4-7 where expected full 8s). Pair placement didn't trigger properly, and spreading didn't extend to non-original-8 rows. What worked: Protected 3 and 4 areas correctly; horizontal spreads in seeded rows.
 * Train 2: Generated initial 8,8 pairs in cols 8-9 correctly for top rows, but missed left-side 8s in cols 4-5 (expected 8,8 but generated 1,1); row 2 expected 8s in cols 14-21 but generated 6s/1s; central merge (bar3=6?) not handled to fill row 2 cols 14-21 with 8s; bottom rows under-filled (e.g., row 14 expected full 8s cols 8-23 but generated partial). What worked: Spread in row 8-9 full 8s; protected 1,3,6 areas. Pair detection missed or not applied vertically.
 * Train 3: Generated some 8 spreads (e.g., cols 12-13 in middle rows), but missed left extensions (e.g., top rows expected 8,8 in cols 3-4 but generated 7,7; row 4 expected 8,8 cols 3-4 but generated 7,7); row 5 over-filled with 7s where expected 8s cols 0-11; vertical blobs not connected (e.g., row 14 expected 8s cols 20-23 but generated 6s). What worked: Right-side 6 protections; some horizontal spreads in row 11-12. Merge (bar4=6?) not enabling cross-bar fills.
 * get_initial_pair is helpful for seeding but broken in application—only places in one row and only if no original 8s, missing vertical propagation; don't rely on it alone.
 * has_eight (checks if 8 in row) is simple but useful for identifying seed rows; however, the main program logic skips spreading on non-seed rows too aggressively.
 * Overall, attempts show understanding of bars/protected but fail on vertical connectivity, merge-enabled fills across central areas (e.g., when bar=6, 8s might bridge gaps), and inserting seeds in empty rows based on alignment rather than single pair.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it over-fills with 9s in many areas (e.g., rows 3-6 full 9s where 8s should spread instead, assuming 9 is a bar color but spreading logic treated it wrong); row 7 has 1s in cols 0-2 then full 8s, but if vertical from above, more 8s expected in left; rows 13-16 full 9s bottom-right, but spreading should stop at protected 3s in cols 21-23; row 17 full 9s, row 18 partial 4s in center but no 8s where seeds might start. It ignores potential vertical 8 propagation from row 7-10's 8s downward, and pair/merge not detected (no initial 8 pair found?). This suggests the program didn't extract bars correctly (bars seem 2 left, 9 center/right, 3/4 bottom), leading to wrong protected set; output looks like it copied input without proper 8 spreading, making it incoherent for a fill puzzle.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python

    bar2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    bar3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    bar4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 22:10:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely 25 rows total, but focusing on rows 6-24 for output) where the number 8 represents a spreading element (like ink or flood fill) that originates from initial pairs of adjacent 8's and expands horizontally in rows, while respecting "protected" areas defined by colored bars (non-zero values in specific bar positions) and the value 5. The spreading is conditional on a "merge" condition (when bar2 or bar3 is 6), and the goal is to simulate row-by-row evolution of the grid over 19 steps, avoiding overwriting protected cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses numbers as colors/states: 8 is the spreading agent that fills empty/unprotected spaces (likely 0's, though not explicitly shown); other numbers (1-9) are fixed colors or barriers that shouldn't be overwritten.
 * Bars are extracted from row 1 (g[1]), in fixed segments: bar1 (cols 1-4), bar2 (7-10), bar3 (13-16), bar4 (19-22), taking the first non-zero in each— these and 5 are protected from spreading.
 * Spreading only happens if there's a merge (bar2==6 or bar3==6); otherwise, output the original subgrid unchanged.
 * Initial 8-pair detection: Scan rows 6-24 for the first adjacent pair of 8's (positions i and i+1); this pair seeds spreading in subsequent rows if no existing 8's are present.
 * Spreading mechanic: In each row (starting from the row with the initial pair), if a row already has 8's, expand them left/right until hitting protected cells (bars or 5); if no 8's, place 8's at the initial pair positions (if unprotected). This is done sequentially for 19 output rows, but spreading seems cumulative or stateful across rows in some way (e.g., once spread in one row, it influences later rows).
 * Subtlety: Spreading is horizontal only, per row, but the simulation is over time (19 steps), so early rows may show initial seeds, while later rows show full expansion; however, the code treats it as independent per row with global initial pair.
 * Edge cases: Protected cells block spread but aren't overwritten; if initial pair positions are protected, don't place 8's there; bars can be 0 (no protection in that segment?); value 6 in bars triggers merge mode.
 * Rows are 24 elements long (0-indexed cols 0-23); output is exactly 19 rows (g[6:25] processed).
 * Potential misses: Spreading might need to propagate vertically or based on prior row states (code assumes independent rows); initial pair is global but applied per row without 8's; over-spreading into protected areas; missing right-side seeds in some examples (e.g., training 1 has initial 8's on right not detected); merge condition might enable bi-directional or full-grid spread.
 * Unclear: Exact input grid structure (full g not shown, but rows 6+ are the evolving part); what 0 represents (empty?); why some expected rows have sudden full 8 spreads (e.g., row 14 in training 1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)
    bar2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    bar3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    bar4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts bar colors correctly from fixed positions in row 1, useful for protection.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2: int, bar3: int) -> bool:
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(Simple but key condition to enable/disable spreading mode.)

```python
def get_initial_pair(g: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for row in g[6:25]:
        i = 0
        n = len(row)
        while i < n - 1:
            if row[i] == 8 and row[i + 1] == 8:
                return (i, i + 1)
            i += 1
    return None
```
(Detects the first adjacent 8-pair across the subgrid; helpful for seeding, but may miss multiple pairs or right-side ones like in training 1.)

```python
def spread_row(row: List[int], protected: set) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row.copy()
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(Expands existing 8-blocks left/right until protected; core spreading logic, but assumes input row already has 8's—doesn't handle seeding new 8's.)

The main `program` function orchestrates: computes bars/protected, checks merge, finds pair, then per row: if has 8's spread them, else seed pair if possible; outputs 19 rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; all three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding.
 * Worked: Correctly detects bars and protected set (including 5); implements horizontal spreading from existing 8's without overwriting protected; finds initial 8-pair and seeds it in rows without 8's; skips processing if no merge.
 * Didn't work: Spreading/seeding is too limited—applies initial pair globally to all non-8 rows without progression (e.g., doesn't simulate time-based growth from prior rows); over-spreads in some cases (e.g., training 1 row 7-8 fills entire middle with 8's, but expected has gaps); misses additional seeds (e.g., training 1 has right-side 8's at cols 16-17 not detected/spread initially); in non-merge? Wait, all examples seem to have merge but code assumes it.
 * Training 1 differences: Generated keeps initial 8's at cols 8-9 but misses right-side 8's (cols 16-17 in expected rows 0-6); row 8 spreads left to cols 4-7 (3's become 8's) but expected keeps them as 3's until later; row 9 reverts to 3's instead of keeping partial 8's (expected has 8's at 4-5 and 8-9); row 14 has no spread (all 3's) vs expected full 8's cols 4-21; bottom rows match (2's appear correctly, likely from input).
 * Training 2 differences: No initial spread to cols 4-5 (expected has 8's there from row 0); row 2 clears middle 8's too early (expected keeps and spreads right to cols 13-21); row 4 has no right spread (expected full 8's cols 13-21); row 10 reverts middle without left 8's (expected has 8's at 4-5); row 14 spreads bottom but misses full 8's in middle (expected cols 8-21); function assumes single pair but example has multiple seed areas.
 * Training 3 differences: Misses initial left 8's at cols 3-4 (expected from row 0); row 4 spreads too much left (fills cols 0-7 with 7's? Wait, generated has 7's but expected 8's); row 6 keeps partial but expected full 8's cols 0-11; row 11 over-spreads to full 8's cols 3-19 but expected only around seeds; row 14 misses right spread (expected 8's at 18-19); row 15 changes right to 7's too early vs expected 8's persisting.
 * `get_initial_pair` is helpful but broken for multiple pairs (returns only first, misses right-side in train1/2); `spread_row` is useful but doesn't handle seeding or vertical influence; main loop processes rows independently without state carryover (likely why spreads don't progress cumulatively).
 * No unhelpful functions— all provided are relevant, but `get_initial_pair` needs enhancement for all seeds.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows minimal 8's (only in rows 7-8 at cols 8-10, from apparent seed) and over-relies on input colors (lots of 2's top, 9's middle/bottom, 4's late), but spreading seems absent or blocked entirely after initial, with no progression (e.g., rows 0-2 all 2's, then sudden 9's in row 3 without transition; row 7 has partial 8's but row 10 reverts to 9's; row 17 has 4's starting at col 7 but no 8 integration). This mismatches puzzle expectation of gradual 8-spread if merge is true (assuming bars include 6 somewhere, not shown); likely misses detecting/handling initial pair (possibly at cols 8-9 based on 8's placement) and full horizontal expansion around it, plus no cumulative effect across rows (e.g., 8's should fill more of the 9's area over time). Without full input grid, hard to confirm exact expected, but patterns from training suggest more 8-filling in middle rows (e.g., around cols 4-20) before late 4's/9's dominate; current output feels static/input-copying rather than simulated evolution.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 22:10:36] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Only interactions or connections observed consistently across **all** train examples (inputs 1-3) are listed. No assumptions about the test input or overall puzzle mechanics are made. Connections are limited to obvious, direct links between properties (e.g., position influencing transformation, color propagation, shape properties like holes affecting outcomes). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the 4 top thin colored blocks, which are always present but show no direct transformation or preservation in outputs) are noted only if they have a consistent effect. Unknown mechanisms (e.g., exact hole count changes) are flagged as such. No high-level interpretation or solution is provided.

#### 1. **Positional Arrangement (y >= 6) → Bounding Box Transformation (y-shift)**
   - **Components Involved**: Regular colored rectangular blocks (e.g., Blue, Yellow, Red, Pink, Green; holes=0; varying sizes/pixels; not the large background, not Maroon, not top Orange, not top thin blocks). These are mid-to-bottom elements like vertical/horizontal bars or fills.
   - **Interaction**: If bbox y1 >= 6 (i.e., positioned within or starting at the lower canvas section), the entire bbox y-coordinates (y1 and y2) are decreased by exactly 6 units. x-coordinates, color, holes (always 0), and pixels remain unchanged.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs for every such element in all train inputs:
     - Input 1: Blue [0,9,3,17] → [0,3,3,11]; Yellow [18,10,21,16] → [18,4,21,10]; Red [4,22,14,24] → [4,16,14,18].
     - Input 2: Pink [13,6,17,7] → [13,0,17,1]; Green [16,11,19,16] → [16,5,19,10]; Red [0,11,3,17] → [0,5,3,11]; Yellow [5,22,12,24] → [5,16,12,18].
     - Input 3: Green [8,6,17,9] → [8,0,17,3]; Pink [20,9,23,19] → [20,3,23,13]; Red [0,13,2,24] → [0,7,2,18]; Yellow [8,22,21,24] → [8,16,21,18].
   - **Effect**: Moves elements upward into the former top frame area without altering shape or fill. No interaction with colors or holes beyond preservation.

#### 2. **Background Field (Large Holed Area) → Color Propagation and Hole Property Change**
   - **Components Involved**: The single large background field (color varies: Green in input 1, Blue in input 2, Dark Red in input 3; holes >0, specifically 1-2; bbox always starts [0,6,... ,23,24-ish]; large pixels ~290-366; spans full width, lower canvas).
   - **Interaction**: 
     - Color property propagates unchanged to multiple new 0-hole segments (same color as input background).
     - Holes property (1-2 in input) → all output segments have holes=0 (loss of holes).
     - Position (starts at y=6) → output segments repositioned to start from y=0, with varying bboxes (e.g., horizontal strips or fills at top/mid/bottom, widths varying 3-23 units, heights 1-13 units, pixels 3-96 per segment).
   - **Consistency**: Always 1 input background → 5-7 output segments of matching color and 0 holes in all trains. Total output pixels for these segments do not directly match input (e.g., input 1: 355 → output Greens total ~243; varies), suggesting overlap or partial fill (unknown mechanism). Examples:
     - Input 1 (Green, 2 holes) → 5 Green segments (0 holes): [0,0,7,6], [10,0,15,6], [10,0,23,13], [6,9,7,13], [0,12,3,18], [15,16,23,18].
     - Input 2 (Blue, 2 holes) → 6 Blue segments (0 holes): [18,0,23,1], [0,0,3,4], [6,0,7,7], [10,0,13,7], [10,4,23,13], [0,10,7,18], [13,16,23,18].
     - Input 3 (Dark Red, 1 hole) → 7 Dark Red segments (0 holes): [20,0,23,2], [0,0,2,3], [5,0,7,3], [0,6,2,6], [14,4,17,10], [5,6,11,10], [5,13,11,13], [14,13,23,18], [3,16,7,18].
   - **Effect**: Background "splits" into non-holed fills, interacting with the y=6 start position to extend upward (y-=6 effectively for the field as a whole). No direct pixel preservation; interacts with shifted elements by filling around them (e.g., gaps in upper/lower areas).

#### 3. **Top Orange Frame → Removal and Area Reassignment**
   - **Components Involved**: The fixed top frame (always Orange; holes=4; bbox=[0,0,23,5]; pixels=80; full-width horizontal with holes).
   - **Interaction**: Completely removed (no Orange in any output). Its position (y=0-5) → reassigned to background color segments from interaction #2, which now occupy y=0 upward.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every input, absent in every output. The former area is always filled by background-colored 0-hole segments (from #2), with no residual Orange properties (color, holes, pixels).
   - **Effect**: Positional handover to background field; holes=4 do not propagate or affect outputs directly.

#### 4. **Small Maroon Block → Size/Position Expansion and Hole Acquisition**
   - **Components Involved**: The single small Maroon block (color=Maroon; holes=0; small bbox ~1-2 width, 1-2 height, positioned mid-height y=13-18, x=8-12; pixels=4-9).
   - **Interaction**: 
     - Position (mid y=13-18) → expands to large upper frame (bbox ~[0-4,0,19-23,15]; height fixed ~15 units, full/near-full width).
     - Size/pixels → increases significantly (input 4-9 → output 116-138 pixels).
     - Holes=0 → acquires holes (output holes=0-2; exact number unknown, does not consistently match input background holes or other properties).
     - Color preserved (Maroon).
   - **Consistency**: Always 1 small input Maroon → 1 large output Maroon in all trains. Expansion targets upper area (y=0-15), independent of y-shift in #1. Examples:
     - Input 1 ([8,13,9,14], 4px, 0 holes) → [4,0,23,15], 116px, 1 hole.
     - Input 2 ([8,14,9,15], 4px, 0 holes) → [4,0,23,15], 124px, 0 holes.
     - Input 3 ([12,17,13,18], 4px, 0 holes) → [0,0,19,15], 138px, 2 holes.
   - **Effect**: Transforms from small interior element to large enclosing frame; interacts with upper position by overwriting/filling y=0-15 area. Hole acquisition mechanism unknown (varies 0-2, no clear link to input properties like background holes).

#### 5. **Top Thin Colored Blocks → Removal (No Direct Preservation)**
   - **Components Involved**: 4 small vertical blocks (colors vary: e.g., Blue/Pink/Yellow/Red; holes=0; bbox=[x,1,x,4]; pixels=4 each; x positions vary 1-22).
   - **Interaction**: Completely removed (no matching color/position/pixels in outputs). Positions (x=1-22 at y=1-4) may indirectly affect background splitting (#2), as output segment boundaries often align near input x-positions (e.g., input 1 x=1,7,13,19 → output boundaries at x=7,10,15), but exact mechanism unknown and not consistent in alignment.
   - **Consistency**: Always exactly 4 present in inputs, always absent/removed in outputs. Colors do not propagate to new elements. No effect on movement or transformation beyond possible unknown influence on background segmentation widths.
   - **Effect**: Isolated removal; no interaction with other properties like color or holes.

#### Notes on Non-Connections and Unknowns
- **No Consistent Color-to-Movement Link**: Colors of regular blocks (#1) or top thins (#5) do not influence shifts, splits, or other transformations (e.g., Pink present in some inputs but not preserved if only top-thin).
- **No Consistent Hole-to-Hole Propagation (Beyond Background)**: Only background holes (#2) consistently become 0; Maroon acquires holes (#4) variably (unknown cause); other elements preserve holes=0.
- **No Pixel Preservation Across Special Elements**: Pixels change for background splits (#2) and Maroon expansion (#4); unknown why (e.g., no direct area calculation match).
- **No Irrelevant Elements Identified**: All listed components interact as above; no isolated elements (e.g., all inputs/outputs accounted for by these).
- **Unknowns**: Exact splitting logic for background segments (#2, e.g., how top-thin x-positions influence boundaries); hole count for Maroon (#4); total pixel discrepancies in backgrounds. No forced explanations.

[2025-10-01 22:12:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Only interactions or connections observed consistently across **all** train examples (inputs 1-3) are listed. No assumptions about the test input or overall puzzle mechanics are made. Connections are limited to obvious, direct links between properties (e.g., position influencing transformation, color propagation, shape properties like holes affecting outcomes). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the 4 top thin colored blocks, which are always present but show no direct transformation or preservation in outputs) are noted only if they have a consistent effect. Unknown mechanisms (e.g., exact hole count changes) are flagged as such. No high-level interpretation or solution is provided.

#### 1. **Positional Arrangement (y >= 6) → Bounding Box Transformation (y-shift)**
   - **Components Involved**: Regular colored rectangular blocks (e.g., Blue, Yellow, Red, Pink, Green; holes=0; varying sizes/pixels; not the large background, not Maroon, not top Orange, not top thin blocks). These are mid-to-bottom elements like vertical/horizontal bars or fills.
   - **Interaction**: If bbox y1 >= 6 (i.e., positioned within or starting at the lower canvas section), the entire bbox y-coordinates (y1 and y2) are decreased by exactly 6 units. x-coordinates, color, holes (always 0), and pixels remain unchanged.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs for every such element in all train inputs:
     - Input 1: Blue [0,9,3,17] → [0,3,3,11]; Yellow [18,10,21,16] → [18,4,21,10]; Red [4,22,14,24] → [4,16,14,18].
     - Input 2: Pink [13,6,17,7] → [13,0,17,1]; Green [16,11,19,16] → [16,5,19,10]; Red [0,11,3,17] → [0,5,3,11]; Yellow [5,22,12,24] → [5,16,12,18].
     - Input 3: Green [8,6,17,9] → [8,0,17,3]; Pink [20,9,23,19] → [20,3,23,13]; Red [0,13,2,24] → [0,7,2,18]; Yellow [8,22,21,24] → [8,16,21,18].
   - **Effect**: Moves elements upward into the former top frame area without altering shape or fill. No interaction with colors or holes beyond preservation.

#### 2. **Background Field (Large Holed Area) → Color Propagation and Hole Property Change**
   - **Components Involved**: The single large background field (color varies: Green in input 1, Blue in input 2, Dark Red in input 3; holes >0, specifically 1-2; bbox always starts [0,6,... ,23,24-ish]; large pixels ~290-366; spans full width, lower canvas).
   - **Interaction**: 
     - Color property propagates unchanged to multiple new 0-hole segments (same color as input background).
     - Holes property (1-2 in input) → all output segments have holes=0 (loss of holes).
     - Position (starts at y=6) → output segments repositioned to start from y=0, with varying bboxes (e.g., horizontal strips or fills at top/mid/bottom, widths varying 3-23 units, heights 1-13 units, pixels 3-96 per segment).
   - **Consistency**: Always 1 input background → 5-7 output segments of matching color and 0 holes in all trains. Total output pixels for these segments do not directly match input (e.g., input 1: 355 → output Greens total ~243; varies), suggesting overlap or partial fill (unknown mechanism). Examples:
     - Input 1 (Green, 2 holes) → 5 Green segments (0 holes): [0,0,7,6], [10,0,15,6], [10,0,23,13], [6,9,7,13], [0,12,3,18], [15,16,23,18].
     - Input 2 (Blue, 2 holes) → 6 Blue segments (0 holes): [18,0,23,1], [0,0,3,4], [6,0,7,7], [10,0,13,7], [10,4,23,13], [0,10,7,18], [13,16,23,18].
     - Input 3 (Dark Red, 1 hole) → 7 Dark Red segments (0 holes): [20,0,23,2], [0,0,2,3], [5,0,7,3], [0,6,2,6], [14,4,17,10], [5,6,11,10], [5,13,11,13], [14,13,23,18], [3,16,7,18].
   - **Effect**: Background "splits" into non-holed fills, interacting with the y=6 start position to extend upward (y-=6 effectively for the field as a whole). No direct pixel preservation; interacts with shifted elements by filling around them (e.g., gaps in upper/lower areas).

#### 3. **Top Orange Frame → Removal and Area Reassignment**
   - **Components Involved**: The fixed top frame (always Orange; holes=4; bbox=[0,0,23,5]; pixels=80; full-width horizontal with holes).
   - **Interaction**: Completely removed (no Orange in any output). Its position (y=0-5) → reassigned to background color segments from interaction #2, which now occupy y=0 upward.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every input, absent in every output. The former area is always filled by background-colored 0-hole segments (from #2), with no residual Orange properties (color, holes, pixels).
   - **Effect**: Positional handover to background field; holes=4 do not propagate or affect outputs directly.

#### 4. **Small Maroon Block → Size/Position Expansion and Hole Acquisition**
   - **Components Involved**: The single small Maroon block (color=Maroon; holes=0; small bbox ~1-2 width, 1-2 height, positioned mid-height y=13-18, x=8-12; pixels=4-9).
   - **Interaction**: 
     - Position (mid y=13-18) → expands to large upper frame (bbox ~[0-4,0,19-23,15]; height fixed ~15 units, full/near-full width).
     - Size/pixels → increases significantly (input 4-9 → output 116-138 pixels).
     - Holes=0 → acquires holes (output holes=0-2; exact number unknown, does not consistently match input background holes or other properties).
     - Color preserved (Maroon).
   - **Consistency**: Always 1 small input Maroon → 1 large output Maroon in all trains. Expansion targets upper area (y=0-15), independent of y-shift in #1. Examples:
     - Input 1 ([8,13,9,14], 4px, 0 holes) → [4,0,23,15], 116px, 1 hole.
     - Input 2 ([8,14,9,15], 4px, 0 holes) → [4,0,23,15], 124px, 0 holes.
     - Input 3 ([12,17,13,18], 4px, 0 holes) → [0,0,19,15], 138px, 2 holes.
   - **Effect**: Transforms from small interior element to large enclosing frame; interacts with upper position by overwriting/filling y=0-15 area. Hole acquisition mechanism unknown (varies 0-2, no clear link to input properties like background holes).

#### 5. **Top Thin Colored Blocks → Removal (No Direct Preservation)**
   - **Components Involved**: 4 small vertical blocks (colors vary: e.g., Blue/Pink/Yellow/Red; holes=0; bbox=[x,1,x,4]; pixels=4 each; x positions vary 1-22).
   - **Interaction**: Completely removed (no matching color/position/pixels in outputs). Positions (x=1-22 at y=1-4) may indirectly affect background splitting (#2), as output segment boundaries often align near input x-positions (e.g., input 1 x=1,7,13,19 → output boundaries at x=7,10,15), but exact mechanism unknown and not consistent in alignment.
   - **Consistency**: Always exactly 4 present in inputs, always absent/removed in outputs. Colors do not propagate to new elements. No effect on movement or transformation beyond possible unknown influence on background segmentation widths.
   - **Effect**: Isolated removal; no interaction with other properties like color or holes.

#### Notes on Non-Connections and Unknowns
- **No Consistent Color-to-Movement Link**: Colors of regular blocks (#1) or top thins (#5) do not influence shifts, splits, or other transformations (e.g., Pink present in some inputs but not preserved if only top-thin).
- **No Consistent Hole-to-Hole Propagation (Beyond Background)**: Only background holes (#2) consistently become 0; Maroon acquires holes (#4) variably (unknown cause); other elements preserve holes=0.
- **No Pixel Preservation Across Special Elements**: Pixels change for background splits (#2) and Maroon expansion (#4); unknown why (e.g., no direct area calculation match).
- **No Irrelevant Elements Identified**: All listed components interact as above; no isolated elements (e.g., all inputs/outputs accounted for by these).
- **Unknowns**: Exact splitting logic for background segments (#2, e.g., how top-thin x-positions influence boundaries); hole count for Maroon (#4); total pixel discrepancies in backgrounds. No forced explanations.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 22:31:58] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to detect a background color, shift and clean the main content into a 19-row output grid, identify a central "maroon" object (color 8) bounding box, and then augment the grid by adding maroon (8) elements to form structural extensions like vertical risers, horizontal connectors, and bottom fills that frame or connect the maroon object to surrounding elements, while respecting spans, gaps, and conditional placements based on other non-background objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent non-0, non-5 color in the input's rows 6-23 (likely the "empty" or filler space); defaults to 3 if tied or unclear.
 * Content shifting extracts rows 6-23 of input into rows 0-18 of output, replacing 0s and 5s with background, and duplicates the last row if needed to fill 19 rows—ensures no original borders or artifacts remain.
 * Maroon object (color 8) bounding box (min/max row/col) is extracted from input rows 6-23, shifted to 0-based output coordinates; if absent, defaults to invalid (0,0,0,0) which may skip augmentations.
 * Horizontal span calculation for the maroon's y-range finds the minimal left/right bounds that cover all non-bg cells in that vertical slice, effectively determining a "coverage width" that may extend beyond the maroon itself to include nearby objects.
 * Upward verticals (risers) are placed as 8's above the maroon: always internal (over maroon cols), always right-aligned (shifted to end of span), and conditionally left-aligned if there's a left-side object whose vertical extent is close enough (distance <= maroon_width +1) to justify connection.
 * Horizontal shorts place 8's directly over the maroon and span positions within the maroon's y-range, but only on bg cells; gaps between sorted positions are connected horizontally with 8's in the y-range only if the entire gap above (rows 0 to y1-1) is clear of non-bg.
 * Downward verticals start right after maroon (y2+1) and extend to a fixed row 13; placed for internal (maroon cols), conditional left (if left object extends below maroon by >= maroon_width +1), and always right; if down height matches maroon height, full horizontal connection across all down positions in those rows.
 * Bottom full fill starts at row 14, height matching maroon height (up to row 18), spanning from leftmost down position to either full width (if no right extensions below row 13) or rightmost down position; only on bg cells.
 * Subtleties: All placements overwrite only bg cells (no overwriting existing content); connections require clear space above/below for verticals; fixed row limits (e.g., down to 13, bottom from 14) suggest a structured output height with distinct zones (top for risers, middle for object, bottom for base); spans must account for all non-bg in y-range to avoid narrow framing; left/right placements are asymmetric and conditional on nearby object extents (e.g., left_start_y, right_end_y, left_end_y); maroon_width drives many decisions (e.g., connection lengths); potential for overfilling if conditions misapplied, like placing left up/down too aggressively.
 * Edge cases: No maroon (skip augmentations?); maroon near edges (clamp to 0/width-1); varying object positions (left, center, right) affect span and connections; heights may not align perfectly, so fixed down_y2=13 acts as a cap; output is always 19 rows x input width, with last input row duplicated if short.
 * Across attempts: Preserve original non-8, non-bg content exactly (e.g., 1's, 2's, 4's, 6's, 9's); 8's only added, never removed; consider full-width bottoms only if no protruding right objects.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background_color(g):
    counts = [0] * 16
    for row in g[6:24]:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell != 5:
                counts[cell] += 1
    max_count = max(counts)
    for c in range(16):
        if counts[c] == max_count:
            return c
    return 3  # default
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most common non-0/5 in content area; useful for cleaning.)

```python
def shift_content(g, bg):
    width = len(g[0])
    height_out = 19
    grid = [[bg for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height_out)]
    for i in range(6, 24):
        out_i = i - 6
        if out_i >= height_out:
            break
        for j in range(width):
            cell = g[i][j]
            if cell != 0 and cell != 5:
                grid[out_i][j] = cell
    # copy last row
    if height_out > 0:
        grid[height_out - 1] = grid[height_out - 2][:]
    return grid
```
(This extracts and cleans content reliably; essential for base grid setup; duplication handles short inputs.)

```python
def get_maroon_pos(g):
    min_i = 100
    max_i = -1
    min_j = 100
    max_j = -1
    width = len(g[0])
    for i in range(6, 24):
        for j in range(width):
            if g[i][j] == 8:
                min_i = min(min_i, i)
                max_i = max(max_i, i)
                min_j = min(min_j, j)
                max_j = max(max_j, j)
    if min_i == 100:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0  # default if none
    return min_j, min_i - 6, max_j, max_i - 6
```
(Bounding box for 8's in content area, shifted to output coords; core for locating target object; handles absence gracefully.)

```python
def calculate_span(grid, bg, y1, y2, width):
    # leftmost non-bg right +1
    left_start = width
    for j in range(width):
        is_non_bg = any(grid[i][j] != bg for i in range(max(0, y1), min(19, y2 + 1)))
        if is_non_bg:
            left_start = min(left_start, j)
    start_span = left_start + 1 if left_start < width else 0
    start_span = max(0, start_span)
    # rightmost non-bg left -1
    right_end = -1
    for j in range(width - 1, -1, -1):
        is_non_bg = any(grid[i][j] != bg for i in range(max(0, y1), min(19, y2 + 1)))
        if is_non_bg:
            right_end = max(right_end, j)
    end_span = right_end - 1 if right_end >= 0 else width - 1
    end_span = min(width - 1, end_span)
    if start_span > end_span:
        start_span = 0
        end_span = width - 1
    return start_span, end_span
```
(Computes effective horizontal coverage for y-range; key for determining frame width; but note potential off-by-one in end_span calc, as it sets to width-1 on no non-bg, which may overextend.)

```python
def find_left_start_end(grid, bg, start, width):
    left_start_y = 100
    left_end_y = -1
    for i in range(19):
        for j in range(start):
            if grid[i][j] != bg:
                left_start_y = min(left_start_y, i)
                left_end_y = max(left_end_y, i)
                break
    return left_start_y, left_end_y
```
(Finds vertical extent of left-side objects before start col; useful for conditional left placements.)

```python
def find_right_end_y(grid, bg, end, width):
    right_end_y = -1
    for i in range(19):
        for j in range(end + 1, width):
            if grid[i][j] != bg:
                right_end_y = max(right_end_y, i)
                break
    return right_end_y
```
(Finds vertical extent of right-side objects after end col; useful for bottom span decisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly detects bg (e.g., 3 in train 1, 1 in train 2/3) and shifts content without artifacts, preserving original shapes like the 1's block, 2's base, 4's bottom in train 1.
 * Upward verticals partially work: internal and right placements add 8's correctly in many spots (e.g., train 1 rows 0-2 over maroon cols 8-9), but left up is overplaced or missing (train 1: no left 8's in rows 0-3 cols 0-4 where expected; train 2: misplaced left 8's in rows 0-2 cols 0-3 instead of cols 4-5).
 * Horizontal shorts/connects fail consistently: shorts overplace 8's (train 1 rows 4-11 cols 0-3 have 1's unchanged but expected 8's in rows 7-8 cols 4-7; no connection between left/middle in row 12); gaps not connected properly (train 2: no horizontal 8's in row 2 cols 11-19 where expected full connect; train 3: overconnects in rows 4-6 cols 0-7 with 7's unchanged to 8's incorrectly).
 * Downward verticals are incomplete: internal/right placed but left conditional wrong (train 1: no left down 8's in rows 12-13 cols 0-3; train 3: down in rows 12-13 cols 12-13 correct but no full connect); height match for full down connect misapplied (train 2: down height=3 but no wide 8's in rows 11-13 cols 4-20).
 * Bottom full miscalculates span/end: overfills or underfills (train 1: rows 14-16 cols 0-23 with 8's but expected only partial; train 3: row 14-16 cols 0-3 and 8-23 but generated full 8's incorrectly; train 2: no bottom 8's at all, just original 4's).
 * calculate_span often computes wrong bounds (train 1: start=0, end=23? leading to full-width overplacements; train 2: narrow span misses right extensions); conditions like place_left_up/down use wrong thresholds (e.g., <= maroon_width +1 too loose, causing phantom lefts).
 * find_left_start_end and find_right_end_y are helpful but underused—e.g., left_start_y=100 (no left object) should skip left up, but code places it anyway in some cases; right_end_y <=13 for full bottom not triggering correctly.
 * pos_list and sorted_pos for horizontals/down are conceptually good for multi-object connects but fail on gap checking (can_connect checks rows 0-y1 but places in y1-y2, and breaks early without full scan).
 * No removal of existing 8's—assumes clean shift, but if input has extras, they persist.
 * Train 1 mismatches: generated keeps left 1's in rows 4-11 cols 0-3 (correct) but misses extending 8's left in rows 7-8 cols 4-7 to connect to 1's; row 12 has 3's where expected 8's cols 4-5; bottom rows 14-16 overfill with 8's cols 0-3 instead of stopping at 4.
 * Train 2 mismatches: generated places 8's in wrong left positions (rows 0-4 cols 1-2 instead of cols 4-5); row 2 has fragmented 8's cols 13-17/19 instead of full cols 11-20; down missing entirely (rows 11-13 all 1's/bg where expected 8's cols 4-5/14-15/19?); bottom 4's unchanged but no 8's added.
 * Train 3 mismatches: generated misses left extensions (rows 0-3 cols 0-3 should be 8's over 7's? but expected cols 3-4 8's); rows 4-6 cols 0-7 all 7's unchanged instead of 8's cols 0-11; row 11 overconnects cols 4-23 with 8's but expected partial; bottom row 14 has 8's cols 3-23 but expected cols 0-23 except gaps.
 * Function calculate_span is broken in end_span logic (sets to width-1 on no right non-bg, causing full-width spans incorrectly); find_right_end_y returns -1 if no right objects, but code uses <=13 which may false-positive.
 * The down_connect_pos appending right without condition leads to unintended full spans; bottom_y2 = min(18, 14 + maroon_height -1) is good but start_full/end_full logic fails when down_pos empty (falls back to maroon, missing extensions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overplaces 8's extensively (e.g., rows 7-13 cols 3-20 all 8's, row 14 full 8's cols 3-23, rows 15-16 full 8's) while leaving original 9's and 1's fragmented without proper connections—e.g., no upward risers above the maroon in rows 0-3 cols 8-10/20, and bottom row 17-18 has partial 8's cols 0-2/16-23 mixing with 4's/9's instead of a clean full base; this suggests span calc went full-width incorrectly, and left/right conditionals failed to limit to maroon-adjacent objects (e.g., the left 9's block and right 3's aren't connected properly with shorts/verticals). It mismatches training patterns by not preserving object shapes (e.g., 9's in rows 4-6 cols 0-7/11-19 overwritten partially) and lacks gap-aware connects (e.g., no clear horizontal in row 6 cols 10-19). To handle test, need tighter span (only cover maroon + immediate neighbors), stricter left/right y-extent checks (e.g., distance thresholds based on actual object heights), and bg-only overwrites to avoid smashing 9's/1's.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 22:32:19] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 22:33:44] Response:
### Consistent Interconnections and Properties Across All Training Examples

- **Top Orange frame interaction with small vertical colored bars**: In every input, a single Orange component (holes=4, bbox=[0,0,23,5], pixels=80) consistently contains exactly 4 small vertical thin colored bars (each holes=0, pixels=4, bbox width=1, y-range consistently [1,4]). The bars' colors vary (e.g., combinations of Blue/Pink/Yellow/Red/Green), and their x-positions vary but always total 4 within the Orange's x-range [0,23]. The Orange's 4 holes directly correspond to these 4 bars' placements, suggesting the bars occupy or interact with the holes as fillers/separators. This structure is absent in all outputs, indicating the Orange decomposes or is replaced, with bars' positions influencing output top-level segmentation (e.g., background color fills in gaps between bar x-positions).

- **Non-background, non-top, non-Maroon colored rectangles translation**: In every input, medium-sized colored rectangles (holes=0, pixels=24-63, bbox not starting at y=1-4, colors like Blue/Green/Pink/Red/Yellow, excluding Maroon and large background) consistently undergo a uniform vertical translation upward by exactly 6 units in their bbox y-coordinates. All other bbox parameters (x-range, height, width), holes, and pixels remain identical. Examples:
  - Input 1: Blue ([0,9,3,17],36) → Output 1 ([0,3,3,11],36); Yellow ([18,10,21,16],28) → ([18,4,21,10],28); Red ([4,22,14,24],33) → ([4,16,14,18],33).
  - Input 2: Pink ([13,6,17,7],10) → Output 2 ([13,0,17,1],10); Green ([16,11,19,16],24) → ([16,5,19,10],24); Red ([0,11,3,17],28) → ([0,5,3,11],28).
  - Input 3: Green ([8,6,17,9],40) → Output 3 ([8,0,17,3],40); Pink ([20,9,23,19],44) → ([20,3,23,13],44); Red ([0,13,2,24],36) → ([0,7,2,18],36); Yellow ([8,22,21,24],42) → ([8,16,21,18],42).
  This translation is position-dependent (y-shift only) and does not apply to top bars, Maroon, or background.

- **Large background color propagation and splitting**: In every input, a single large background component (holes=1-2, bbox covering bottom ~[0,6-9,23,24-29], pixels=290-408, colors Green/Blue/Dark Red/Light Blue) consistently determines the primary color of multiple smaller components in the output (same color, total pixels roughly subset of input background pixels). The background splits into 4-6 smaller pieces (holes=0-1 each, various bbox, pixels=3-96), filling top and mid-level areas (y=0-18), particularly in gaps left by translated rectangles and top bar positions. Interaction: Translated rectangles' new positions create "obstructions" that segment the background color into non-overlapping or minimally overlapping fills. Unknown: Exact splitting rule (e.g., how top bar x-positions precisely dictate segment widths/heights) is not obvious from bbox/pixels alone.

- **Maroon component transformation**: In every input, a single small Maroon rectangle (holes=0, pixels=4-9, bbox mid-lower ~[8-12,13-17,9-13,14-18], width=1-2, height=1-2) consistently transforms into a single large Maroon structure in the output (bbox ~[0-4,0,19-23,15], pixels=116-138, holes=0-2). The output Maroon spans the top-to-mid canvas, overlapping or bordering translated rectangles and background fills, suggesting it expands to frame or connect the top Orange's former area with translated elements. Position interaction: Input Maroon's x/y loosely aligns with output Maroon's central x-range, but exact growth mechanism (e.g., why holes increase) is unknown.

- **Top small bar colors influencing output secondary colors**: The 4 top bars' colors in every input consistently appear (or map to) the colors of translated rectangles in the output (e.g., input top Red/Yellow → output translated Red/Yellow; input top Green/Pink → output translated Green/Pink when extras present). No transformation for bars themselves (they vanish), but their colors "transfer" to ensure output has matching secondary colors. Unknown: How/why some top colors (e.g., Pink in input 1) do not produce translated versions if no matching medium rectangle exists in input.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., hole count changes, pixel sums, color-to-color mappings beyond background) are obvious across all examples; elements like the Orange's disappearance or exact background segmentation details cannot be explained without assuming puzzle rules. Irrelevant/isolated elements (e.g., varying top bar x-positions without translation effect) are excluded.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 22:33:44] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnections and Properties Across All Training Examples

- **Top Orange frame interaction with small vertical colored bars**: In every input, a single Orange component (holes=4, bbox=[0,0,23,5], pixels=80) consistently contains exactly 4 small vertical thin colored bars (each holes=0, pixels=4, bbox width=1, y-range consistently [1,4]). The bars' colors vary (e.g., combinations of Blue/Pink/Yellow/Red/Green), and their x-positions vary but always total 4 within the Orange's x-range [0,23]. The Orange's 4 holes directly correspond to these 4 bars' placements, suggesting the bars occupy or interact with the holes as fillers/separators. This structure is absent in all outputs, indicating the Orange decomposes or is replaced, with bars' positions influencing output top-level segmentation (e.g., background color fills in gaps between bar x-positions).

- **Non-background, non-top, non-Maroon colored rectangles translation**: In every input, medium-sized colored rectangles (holes=0, pixels=24-63, bbox not starting at y=1-4, colors like Blue/Green/Pink/Red/Yellow, excluding Maroon and large background) consistently undergo a uniform vertical translation upward by exactly 6 units in their bbox y-coordinates. All other bbox parameters (x-range, height, width), holes, and pixels remain identical. Examples:
  - Input 1: Blue ([0,9,3,17],36) → Output 1 ([0,3,3,11],36); Yellow ([18,10,21,16],28) → ([18,4,21,10],28); Red ([4,22,14,24],33) → ([4,16,14,18],33).
  - Input 2: Pink ([13,6,17,7],10) → Output 2 ([13,0,17,1],10); Green ([16,11,19,16],24) → ([16,5,19,10],24); Red ([0,11,3,17],28) → ([0,5,3,11],28).
  - Input 3: Green ([8,6,17,9],40) → Output 3 ([8,0,17,3],40); Pink ([20,9,23,19],44) → ([20,3,23,13],44); Red ([0,13,2,24],36) → ([0,7,2,18],36); Yellow ([8,22,21,24],42) → ([8,16,21,18],42).
  This translation is position-dependent (y-shift only) and does not apply to top bars, Maroon, or background.

- **Large background color propagation and splitting**: In every input, a single large background component (holes=1-2, bbox covering bottom ~[0,6-9,23,24-29], pixels=290-408, colors Green/Blue/Dark Red/Light Blue) consistently determines the primary color of multiple smaller components in the output (same color, total pixels roughly subset of input background pixels). The background splits into 4-6 smaller pieces (holes=0-1 each, various bbox, pixels=3-96), filling top and mid-level areas (y=0-18), particularly in gaps left by translated rectangles and top bar positions. Interaction: Translated rectangles' new positions create "obstructions" that segment the background color into non-overlapping or minimally overlapping fills. Unknown: Exact splitting rule (e.g., how top bar x-positions precisely dictate segment widths/heights) is not obvious from bbox/pixels alone.

- **Maroon component transformation**: In every input, a single small Maroon rectangle (holes=0, pixels=4-9, bbox mid-lower ~[8-12,13-17,9-13,14-18], width=1-2, height=1-2) consistently transforms into a single large Maroon structure in the output (bbox ~[0-4,0,19-23,15], pixels=116-138, holes=0-2). The output Maroon spans the top-to-mid canvas, overlapping or bordering translated rectangles and background fills, suggesting it expands to frame or connect the top Orange's former area with translated elements. Position interaction: Input Maroon's x/y loosely aligns with output Maroon's central x-range, but exact growth mechanism (e.g., why holes increase) is unknown.

- **Top small bar colors influencing output secondary colors**: The 4 top bars' colors in every input consistently appear (or map to) the colors of translated rectangles in the output (e.g., input top Red/Yellow → output translated Red/Yellow; input top Green/Pink → output translated Green/Pink when extras present). No transformation for bars themselves (they vanish), but their colors "transfer" to ensure output has matching secondary colors. Unknown: How/why some top colors (e.g., Pink in input 1) do not produce translated versions if no matching medium rectangle exists in input.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., hole count changes, pixel sums, color-to-color mappings beyond background) are obvious across all examples; elements like the Orange's disappearance or exact background segmentation details cannot be explained without assuming puzzle rules. Irrelevant/isolated elements (e.g., varying top bar x-positions without translation effect) are excluded.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 22:51:28] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 24x24 grid where non-background components from rows 6+ are translated upward by 6 rows to form a new structure at the top, while adding structural "maroon" elements (color 8) as beams, pillars, and anchors based on the position and gaps around a key maroon bounding box; the background color fills the rest, and lower sections may include additional beams or translated elements depending on bottom components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected groups of the same color (4-directional adjacency), ignoring colors 0 and 5 (likely empty or invalid); only consider components starting from row 6 downward to avoid upper grid noise.
 * Background is the largest component by pixel count; exclude it and color 8 (maroon/structural) from translation, but only translate components with 24-63 pixels (suggesting rectangular or mid-sized objects; smaller/larger may be ignored or treated differently).
 * Maroon (8) acts as an "anchor" – compute its bounding box (bbox) only in rows 6+; shift it up by 6 rows, then derive "beams" by finding the leftmost/rightmost gaps (empty background columns) adjacent to the anchor's columns at the anchor's shifted row height.
 * Beams (horizontal 8's) fill from beam_left to beam_right across the anchor's shifted row range; upper pillars (vertical 8's) extend beams downward from fixed starts (e.g., columns 8 and 16 if anchor_slot==2, else beam edges), always placing as support even over other colors.
 * Lower pillars extend from beam ends and anchor base downward to row 23, only overwriting background (not other colors).
 * Lower beam: Placed one row above the highest row of the bottommost translated component; its extent varies by anchor_slot (e.g., full width if slot==2 and relative3==1, else to anchor max_c); only overwrite background.
 * Top bars: Uniform color columns in rows 1-4 (excluding 0,5) may indicate slots or relative positions (e.g., bars[2]-12 for relative3); anchor_slot = min_c // 6 (likely 0-3 for positioning logic).
 * Subtle: Pillars/beams can overwrite translated components in some cases (upper always, lower only bg); bottom component is the one with max row in cells (after shift); if no translated, default bg=3 but this may not trigger.
 * Edge cases: Anchor may not span full height/width; beams/pillars widths are fixed (e.g., pillar_width=2) or derived (anchor_width); relative3 uses top bars (assumes 4 bars); test inputs may have varying bg (e.g., 3,1,7) and need to preserve non-8 translations accurately.
 * Potential misses: Overwriting non-bg in lower areas blocks pillar extension; incorrect beam_left/right if no gap (defaults to 0/23); lower beam row calc (bottom_min_r -1) may go negative/out-of-bounds; components <24 or >63 pixels ignored (e.g., small debris or large bg-like); top bars assume exactly 4, else relative3=1 (may fail if fewer bars).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_components(g: List[List[int]], start_row: int = 6) -> list[dict]:
    # Uses DFS/stack to find connected components of same color from start_row down, excluding 0/5.
    # Returns list of {'color': int, 'pixels': int, 'cells': list[tuple(r,c)]} – essential for identifying translatable objects, bg, and bottom comp.
    # Helpful: Filters to non-bg, non-8, size 24-63 for translation.
```

```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Finds largest component color as bg (defaults to 3 if none).
    # Helpful: Core for filling output grid and detecting gaps.
```

```python
def get_top_bars(g: List[List[int]]) -> list[int]:
    # Scans columns for uniform non-0/5 color in rows 1-4.
    # Helpful: Derives relative3 (bars[2]-12 if 4 bars else 1) for lower beam logic/anchor_slot.
```

```python
def get_maroon_bbox(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    # Bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) for color 8 in rows 6+.
    # Helpful: Anchor positioning; anchor_slot = min_c // 6; widths/heights for beams/pillars.
```

```python
def get_translated_rectangles(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> list[dict]:
    # Filters components: not bg, not 8, 24<=pixels<=63.
    # Helpful: Only these get shifted up by 6 rows to new positions.
```

```python
def get_bottom_component(translated: list[dict]) -> dict:
    # Max by highest row in cells (for lower beam row = that_min_r -6 -1).
    # Helpful: Positions lower beam just above bottom translated object.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of structural additions (beams/pillars) and overwriting rules.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8's in upper-left (cols 4-5, rows 0-2/12-23) where expected has bg (3); missed full 8 beam in row 14 (cols 4-23); no 2's in rows 16-18 (expected bottom translated?); lower pillars/beam incomplete or wrong extent; translated 1's and 4's mostly correct but beams overwrite incorrectly.
 * Train 1: Top bars and relative3 logic placed pillars wrong (e.g., left_upper_start=8 but generated starts at 4); beam_left/right miscalc (used shifted_min_r=7? leading to left_trans_right wrong); lower beam row wrong (placed at row 11? but expected none, instead full 8's lower).
 * Train 2: Generated bg=1 correctly but filled lower rows (12-23) entirely with 1's/bg where expected has 8 beams (rows 14-15 cols 8-23), 4's (rows 16-18 cols 5-13), and 6's (rows 0-2 cols 13-17); missed translating/preserving 6's and 4's properly; pillars/beams only in upper, no lower extension; top bars logic failed (bars likely at cols 4,14? but relative3 wrong).
 * Train 2: Bottom component (likely 4's) not used for lower beam (expected row 15 full 8's); beam_left/right calc ignored gaps around anchor (min_c~8?); overwrote nothing in lower, leaving all bg.
 * Train 3: Generated mismatched top (7's instead of 3's in cols 8-17 rows 0-2); extra 8's in row 4 cols 0-3/20-23; wrong pillar widths (e.g., row 6 cols 3-7 as 8's but expected 7's); missed full 8's in row 4 cols 0-23?; bottom 4's in rows 16-18 cols 8-21 correct but surrounding 7's wrong; 6's translated but pillar overwrite incomplete.
 * Train 3: Bg=7 correct, but anchor bbox miscalc (min_c~0? leading to slot=0, wrong upper starts); relative3 from bars wrong (bars at 8,18?); lower beam not placed (expected none, but generated partial); function get_maroon_bbox scans correctly but beam fill uses wrong r_anchor.
 * Overall: Translation of non-8 components works partially (positions/sizes ok in upper), but beam/pillar placement fails due to incorrect gap detection (left_trans_right/right_trans_left often defaults wrong); lower logic (pillars only on bg, beam extent by slot/relative3) inconsistent; size filter 24-63 may exclude key elements (e.g., Train 2's 6's or 4's?); top bars assume 4 but may vary.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but get_top_bars assumes uniform rows 1-4 (may miss if not uniform); beam calc in program() fragile (uses single r_anchor, may miss if anchor not uniform height; left_trans_right scans only left of min_c but may find wrong edge if multiple components).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have translated components upward (e.g., 9's from lower to rows 3-5/13-23, 1's to rows 6-10/11-12, 3's as bg in cols 21-23), and placed some 8 pillars/beams (cols 3-4 throughout, row 7 cols 5-19 as 8's), but inconsistencies suggest errors: upper rows 0-2 have 2's in cols 0-2/5-19 where likely bg or different translation expected (2's may be unfiltered small component); row 5 has mixed 8's and 9's breaking beam continuity; lower rows 13-23 have 9's overwriting potential pillars (e.g., cols 5-20 should be 8's if lower pillars extend, but 9's persist); no clear lower beam (e.g., above bottom 9's at row 23, expected row 22 full 8's?); right side cols 19-20 have 8's but then 3's abruptly, suggesting wrong beam_right (gap detection failed around anchor min_c~?); overall, lacks full structural support (beams/pillars not spanning anchor bbox properly), and 3's in lower-right may be bg but positioned as if untranslated debris; does not match puzzle rules as beams/pillars seem partial/underfilled, and small 2's/3's suggest size filter or component detection missed filtering.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 22:51:44] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three training input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in *every* example (i.e., Train 1, 2, and 3). I focused solely on patterns that hold without exception, using properties like color, holes, position (bbox), and pixel count. No high-level puzzle solution or speculation is included. Connections that vary (e.g., exact pixel counts in outputs for certain elements, hole counts in transformed backgrounds, or unexplainable splits) are noted as unknown where they cannot be clearly linked. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., the top small pixel=4 shapes, which appear in inputs but have no consistent transformation or effect in outputs; the orange frame, which is static in inputs but vanishes without clear interaction) are excluded entirely.

#### 1. **Non-background foreground shapes (holes=0, pixels >=10) → Position transformation (y-shift)**
   - **Components involved**: Rectangular or block-like shapes of various colors (e.g., Blue, Yellow, Red, Pink, Green), excluding background and small pixel=4 elements. These are the "medium" embedded shapes in the input (e.g., Blue in Train 1, Pink in Train 2, Green in Train 3).
   - **Properties affected**: Position (specifically y-coordinates in bbox).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: In every example, these shapes undergo a consistent upward shift in y-position by exactly 6 units. The x-coordinates, width, height, pixel count, color, and holes=0 remain unchanged. The new y-range fits within the output's upper area (y=0 to ~18).
     - Train 1 examples: Blue bbox y=9-17 → y=3-11; Yellow y=10-16 → y=4-10; Red y=22-24 → y=16-18.
     - Train 2 examples: Pink y=6-7 → y=0-1; Green y=11-16 → y=5-10; Red y=11-17 → y=5-11; Yellow y=22-24 → y=16-18.
     - Train 3 examples: Green y=6-9 → y=0-3; Pink y=9-19 → y=3-13; Red y=13-24 → y=7-18; Yellow y=22-24 → y=16-18.
   - **Consistency note**: This transformation is identical across all pairs—no exceptions. These shapes do not overlap with other transformed elements post-shift.

#### 2. **Input background (large area, holes >0) → Output fragmented pieces (same color, multiple components)**
   - **Components involved**: The dominant large background area in input (color C, e.g., Green in Train 1, Blue in Train 2, Dark Red in Train 3), spanning bbox ~[0,6,23,24] with high pixel count (~290-366) and holes (1 or 2).
   - **Properties affected**: Structure (splits into 4-6 smaller components), position (redistributed to y=0-18), color (preserved as C).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: In every example, the background fragments into multiple smaller pieces, all retaining color C and holes=0. These pieces fill the output's upper-to-mid area (y=0 to ~18, x=0-23), often adjacent or overlapping in bbox but separate components. Pixel counts per piece vary (e.g., 10-96 total ~same as input background minus overlaps), but total pixels approximate the input background's coverage after accounting for shifted shapes. The fragments interact with the y-shifted shapes (from connection #1) by occupying space around them without direct overlap.
     - Train 1: Green (holes=2, p=355) → 5 Green pieces (total p~243, positions filling y=0-18 gaps).
     - Train 2: Blue (holes=2, p=366) → 6 Blue pieces (total p~246, positions filling y=0-18 gaps).
     - Train 3: Dark Red (holes=1, p=290) → 7 Dark Red pieces (total p~149, positions filling y=0-18 gaps; note: lower total pixels here, but coverage consistent).
   - **Consistency note**: Color C preservation and fragmentation into same-color pieces with holes=0 is identical across all pairs. Exact split mechanism (e.g., how positions or sizes are determined) is unknown—no consistent mapping from input properties (e.g., input holes or bbox) to output piece count/size/position.

#### 3. **Small Maroon shape (holes=0, pixels=4) → Large Maroon structure (in output)**
   - **Components involved**: A small Maroon block in input (~1x4, positioned mid-height x~8-12, y~13-18).
   - **Properties affected**: Size (pixels), position (y and x expansion), holes, structure (expands to frame-like).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: In every example, this small Maroon expands into a single large Maroon component in the output, forming a base or frame-like structure at the bottom-front (bbox ~[0-4,0,19-23,15], pixels ~116-138, holes varying 0-2). It interacts with the fragmented background pieces (#2) and shifted shapes (#1) by underlying or bordering them in the lower output area (y=0-15), creating layered/adjacent arrangements. The original small Maroon's position influences the large one's x-start (near input x~8-12), but y shifts down to 0.
     - Train 1: Input [8,13,9,14] p=4 → Output [4,0,23,15] p=116, holes=1.
     - Train 2: Input [8,14,9,15] p=4 → Output [4,0,23,15] p=124, holes=0.
     - Train 3: Input [12,17,13,18] p=4 → Output [0,0,19,15] p=138, holes=2.
   - **Consistency note**: Expansion to a large single Maroon with frame-like bbox (height=15, width~19-23) and mid/low positioning is consistent across all pairs. However, exact pixel increase, hole count, and x-bound precision (e.g., start at 0 vs. 4) are unknown—no direct mapping from input pixels/holes to output values.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Connections
- **Top small shapes (holes=0, pixels=4, various colors at y=1-4)**: Present in all inputs (always 4 shapes, positions x~1-22), but absent in all outputs with no consistent effect (e.g., no color preservation, no position link to fragments or shifts). Possible interaction with background fragmentation (#2) or orange frame is unknown—positions/colors do not map obviously or consistently to output piece locations.
- **Orange frame (holes=4, pixels=80, bbox=[0,0,23,5])**: Identical in all inputs (top border with 4 holes), but completely absent in all outputs. No clear interaction or transformation—holes=4 may loosely relate to number of top small shapes or background fragments, but this is not consistent (fragment counts vary 4-7).
- **Overall layout (e.g., empty spaces or overlaps)**: Input has top-heavy framing (orange + small shapes) and bottom-heavy embedding; output is bottom-heavy with integrated bases (Maroon). White/void spaces separate elements similarly, but no consistent property-based effect (e.g., voids do not transform predictably).
- **Hole count propagation**: Input background holes (1-2) reduce to 0 in output fragments consistently, but small Maroon holes=0 → varying output holes (0-2) is unknown.
- **Pixel total conservation**: Input total pixels ~500-600; output ~500-600, but exact redistribution (e.g., gains/losses in Maroon) is unknown—no consistent ratio.

No other connections (e.g., color-to-color effects, position-to-color changes, or hole-to-size links) are obvious and consistent across *every* example. Forced or varying patterns were ignored.

[2025-10-01 22:52:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three training input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in *every* example (i.e., Train 1, 2, and 3). I focused solely on patterns that hold without exception, using properties like color, holes, position (bbox), and pixel count. No high-level puzzle solution or speculation is included. Connections that vary (e.g., exact pixel counts in outputs for certain elements, hole counts in transformed backgrounds, or unexplainable splits) are noted as unknown where they cannot be clearly linked. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., the top small pixel=4 shapes, which appear in inputs but have no consistent transformation or effect in outputs; the orange frame, which is static in inputs but vanishes without clear interaction) are excluded entirely.

#### 1. **Non-background foreground shapes (holes=0, pixels >=10) → Position transformation (y-shift)**
   - **Components involved**: Rectangular or block-like shapes of various colors (e.g., Blue, Yellow, Red, Pink, Green), excluding background and small pixel=4 elements. These are the "medium" embedded shapes in the input (e.g., Blue in Train 1, Pink in Train 2, Green in Train 3).
   - **Properties affected**: Position (specifically y-coordinates in bbox).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: In every example, these shapes undergo a consistent upward shift in y-position by exactly 6 units. The x-coordinates, width, height, pixel count, color, and holes=0 remain unchanged. The new y-range fits within the output's upper area (y=0 to ~18).
     - Train 1 examples: Blue bbox y=9-17 → y=3-11; Yellow y=10-16 → y=4-10; Red y=22-24 → y=16-18.
     - Train 2 examples: Pink y=6-7 → y=0-1; Green y=11-16 → y=5-10; Red y=11-17 → y=5-11; Yellow y=22-24 → y=16-18.
     - Train 3 examples: Green y=6-9 → y=0-3; Pink y=9-19 → y=3-13; Red y=13-24 → y=7-18; Yellow y=22-24 → y=16-18.
   - **Consistency note**: This transformation is identical across all pairs—no exceptions. These shapes do not overlap with other transformed elements post-shift.

#### 2. **Input background (large area, holes >0) → Output fragmented pieces (same color, multiple components)**
   - **Components involved**: The dominant large background area in input (color C, e.g., Green in Train 1, Blue in Train 2, Dark Red in Train 3), spanning bbox ~[0,6,23,24] with high pixel count (~290-366) and holes (1 or 2).
   - **Properties affected**: Structure (splits into 4-6 smaller components), position (redistributed to y=0-18), color (preserved as C).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: In every example, the background fragments into multiple smaller pieces, all retaining color C and holes=0. These pieces fill the output's upper-to-mid area (y=0 to ~18, x=0-23), often adjacent or overlapping in bbox but separate components. Pixel counts per piece vary (e.g., 10-96 total ~same as input background minus overlaps), but total pixels approximate the input background's coverage after accounting for shifted shapes. The fragments interact with the y-shifted shapes (from connection #1) by occupying space around them without direct overlap.
     - Train 1: Green (holes=2, p=355) → 5 Green pieces (total p~243, positions filling y=0-18 gaps).
     - Train 2: Blue (holes=2, p=366) → 6 Blue pieces (total p~246, positions filling y=0-18 gaps).
     - Train 3: Dark Red (holes=1, p=290) → 7 Dark Red pieces (total p~149, positions filling y=0-18 gaps; note: lower total pixels here, but coverage consistent).
   - **Consistency note**: Color C preservation and fragmentation into same-color pieces with holes=0 is identical across all pairs. Exact split mechanism (e.g., how positions or sizes are determined) is unknown—no consistent mapping from input properties (e.g., input holes or bbox) to output piece count/size/position.

#### 3. **Small Maroon shape (holes=0, pixels=4) → Large Maroon structure (in output)**
   - **Components involved**: A small Maroon block in input (~1x4, positioned mid-height x~8-12, y~13-18).
   - **Properties affected**: Size (pixels), position (y and x expansion), holes, structure (expands to frame-like).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: In every example, this small Maroon expands into a single large Maroon component in the output, forming a base or frame-like structure at the bottom-front (bbox ~[0-4,0,19-23,15], pixels ~116-138, holes varying 0-2). It interacts with the fragmented background pieces (#2) and shifted shapes (#1) by underlying or bordering them in the lower output area (y=0-15), creating layered/adjacent arrangements. The original small Maroon's position influences the large one's x-start (near input x~8-12), but y shifts down to 0.
     - Train 1: Input [8,13,9,14] p=4 → Output [4,0,23,15] p=116, holes=1.
     - Train 2: Input [8,14,9,15] p=4 → Output [4,0,23,15] p=124, holes=0.
     - Train 3: Input [12,17,13,18] p=4 → Output [0,0,19,15] p=138, holes=2.
   - **Consistency note**: Expansion to a large single Maroon with frame-like bbox (height=15, width~19-23) and mid/low positioning is consistent across all pairs. However, exact pixel increase, hole count, and x-bound precision (e.g., start at 0 vs. 4) are unknown—no direct mapping from input pixels/holes to output values.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Connections
- **Top small shapes (holes=0, pixels=4, various colors at y=1-4)**: Present in all inputs (always 4 shapes, positions x~1-22), but absent in all outputs with no consistent effect (e.g., no color preservation, no position link to fragments or shifts). Possible interaction with background fragmentation (#2) or orange frame is unknown—positions/colors do not map obviously or consistently to output piece locations.
- **Orange frame (holes=4, pixels=80, bbox=[0,0,23,5])**: Identical in all inputs (top border with 4 holes), but completely absent in all outputs. No clear interaction or transformation—holes=4 may loosely relate to number of top small shapes or background fragments, but this is not consistent (fragment counts vary 4-7).
- **Overall layout (e.g., empty spaces or overlaps)**: Input has top-heavy framing (orange + small shapes) and bottom-heavy embedding; output is bottom-heavy with integrated bases (Maroon). White/void spaces separate elements similarly, but no consistent property-based effect (e.g., voids do not transform predictably).
- **Hole count propagation**: Input background holes (1-2) reduce to 0 in output fragments consistently, but small Maroon holes=0 → varying output holes (0-2) is unknown.
- **Pixel total conservation**: Input total pixels ~500-600; output ~500-600, but exact redistribution (e.g., gains/losses in Maroon) is unknown—no consistent ratio.

No other connections (e.g., color-to-color effects, position-to-color changes, or hole-to-size links) are obvious and consistent across *every* example. Forced or varying patterns were ignored.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 23:08:45] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based structure (likely a building or platform) where the goal is to identify key colored components (e.g., supports, floors, and special elements like maroon blobs) and fill in background areas with a structural color (8, appearing as maroon) to complete supports and horizontal floors, while shifting the grid upward to simulate a "build" or "completion" effect. The output modifies the input grid by replacing background pixels with 8 in specific vertical and horizontal regions based on component positions, ensuring structural integrity without overwriting non-background elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid has 30 rows (0-29), but processing focuses on rows 6-23 for analysis; the shift_up function copies rows 6-23 to output rows 0-17 and row 23 to row 18, effectively cropping out top rows (0-5) and bottom row (24-29?) to create a 19-row output, which may simulate removing a "ground" or "sky" layer.
 * Background color (C) is the most common non-zero, non-5 color in rows 6-23, excluding 5 (possibly a special "void" or "edge" color); fills only replace C with 8, preserving other colors like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9.
 * Components are rectangular blobs of the same color, size >=4, found via flood-fill-like expansion (horizontal then vertical), excluding C, 0, and 5; they represent structural elements like platforms, walls, or objects.
 * Supports are vertical fills (full height or partial) at specific columns: left starts after the right edge of the leftmost non-8 component; middle uses the maroon (8) component's column range; right starts 2 columns left of the rightmost upper non-8 component (above bottom component).
 * Floors are horizontal fills with 8: for an upper "floor1" at the shifted maroon height (small_minr-6 to small_maxr-6), spanning left to right supports; if "far" (floor1 max row +2 < base row), add a base horizontal at (bottom_minr-6)-2 spanning from bottom component's left to grid right.
 * Subtleties: Maroon (8) components are treated specially (e.g., as middle support or "small" element), but input may already have 8s that shouldn't be overwritten; right support is often partial (only up to floor1 height, not full); "is_far" logic detects multi-level structures; bottom component is the lowest non-8; no diagonal or non-rectangular shapes—assumes axis-aligned rectangles; 5 may be ignored as non-fillable; output must match exactly, including preserving non-C areas.
 * Edge cases: No non-maroon components defaults left support to col 4; no upper components defaults right to col 20; base horizontal only from bottom_start if far; horizontal fills are 1-2 rows thick, but code varies (e.g., floor1_min to floor1_max vs single row).
 * All fills are conditional on C only, so over-filling (e.g., replacing non-C) or under-filling (missing partial supports) breaks outputs; grid width is 24 columns consistently.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of support/floor logic, especially partial fills and multi-level detection.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8 fills in left/middle areas (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 0-3 filled with 8 instead of preserving 3; row 7-8 full 8 horizontal too wide, overwriting 3s; bottom rows 16-18 have 8s in cols 17-18 where expected 3s; row 11-12 have 8s in cols 18-19 where expected 3s/4s). Missed preserving background 3 in non-support areas; overfilled right support below floor1; horizontal floor1 at single row instead of range; is_far logic failed, no base horizontal added correctly.
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled 8s in upper areas (e.g., row 2 cols 6-17 all 8, but expected partial with 1s; row 4 cols 16-17=3 but filled 8? Wait, input has 3 there?); row 9-10 full 8 in cols 6-17 overwriting 1s; bottom rows 16-18 have 8 in col 5 and cols 17-18 where expected 1s; missed narrowing middle support to avoid overwriting 6s/3s; right support too wide/full height; horizontal in row 14-15 too narrow, missing full span.
 * Train 3: Generated partial 8 fills incorrectly (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 18-19=8 but expected 7/8 mix; row 4 cols 0-7=7 but expected 8 full; row 12 full 8 horizontal but expected partial; row 14 cols 20-21=6 but filled 8?; row 16-18 cols 0-2=2 preserved but cols 3-5=8 where expected 7). Underfilled upper supports (e.g., row 4-6 left/middle not fully 8); overfilled right in lower areas; base horizontal in row 16-18 cols 8-21=4 preserved but supports wrong; get_bottom_comp likely buggy (max min_r picks wrong "bottom").
 * Overall: Component detection works (finds blobs), but positioning (e.g., right_start -2) and fill ranges (partial right, is_far for base) fail consistently; shift_up preserves structure but fills ignore levels; no handling for pre-existing 8s or color-specific rules (e.g., 6/4 as special); unhelpful: get_right_support_start filters upper but defaults high (20), causing wide overfills; fill functions are safe but applied wrongly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills with 8 in central columns (e.g., cols 8-19 rows 3-16 mostly 8, creating a wide "pillar" that overwrites what should be preserved 9s/1s for structure), while leaving top rows 0-2 all 2s (correct preservation?) but bottom row 18 has 4s starting col 7 (partial, but spans to col 16 with 9s/8s mismatched). Expected likely narrower supports (e.g., left at col 0-3 for 1s? No, test input has 2s top, 9s middle, 1s lower left, 4s bottom partial), with vertical 8s only at edges/middle based on components (e.g., maroon? None visible, so defaults fail); horizontals missing for floors (e.g., no 8 row at 1s height or base); right support seems partial but too low (row 13-16 cols 20-23=8/9 mix wrong); is_far probably misdetected, no base fill; overall, looks like generic overfill without adapting to test's tall 9/1 stack and right-edge 3s—suggests program assumes maroon presence and fixed widths, breaking on test's layout.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 23:11:18] Response:
### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following interactions and connections between elements are obvious and consistent across **every** train example (Train 1, 2, and 3). Only elements with clear, direct relationships (e.g., transformations preserving specific properties like color or pixels, or causal overlaps like containment) are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the Orange top bar, which appears consistently but has no observable transformation or effect on other components) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided. Interactions that vary (e.g., exact bbox shifts or hole counts) are noted as such, and unexplainable transformations are flagged as unknown.

1. **Large background color → Multiple output fill components (color replication)**  
   - The color of the large background block in input (Green in Train 1, Blue in Train 2, Dark Red in Train 3) directly determines the color of multiple large fill blocks in output.  
   - Preserved: Color exactly matches; these output blocks overlap or adjoin to create layered depth (e.g., filling panels or enclosures).  
   - Effect: Background color "spreads" to 4+ output components, adjusting bbox for structure but preserving the input color as the dominant fill.  
   - Consistent holes: Input background has 1-2 holes; output fills have 0 holes (no hole propagation observed).  
   - Pixels: Input background pixels (290-366) distribute across output fills (total output pixels from these ~200-250, partial sum; exact distribution unknown).

2. **Small central Maroon line → Large enclosing Maroon frame (position and scale transformation)**  
   - The small vertical Maroon line in input (bbox central x ~8-12, mid-height y ~13-18, pixels=4-9, holes=0) transforms into a large horizontal-spanning Maroon frame in output (bbox wide x ~0-23, top-to-mid y ~0-15, pixels=116-138).  
   - Preserved: Color (Maroon); transformation from thin vertical to wide enclosing structure (e.g., outline or bracket-like).  
   - Effect: Input position (central) expands to enclose other output components; interacts with background fills by overlapping edges for depth.  
   - Varying: Holes (input always 0, output 0-2; no consistent hole effect); exact bbox x-start (0 or 4).  
   - Pixels: Increases ~15-30x, indicating scale-up (unknown how pixels are added, possibly from background overlap).

3. **Left tall thin block → Left-side output panel (position shift and preservation)**  
   - The tall thin block on the left in input (color varies: Blue/Red/Red; bbox left x ~0-3, mid-height y ~9-17 or 11-17, pixels=28-36, holes=0) transforms into a similar left-side tall thin panel in output (same color, bbox left x ~0-3, upper y ~3-11 or 5-11 or 7-18, same pixels).  
   - Preserved: Color, pixels (exact match), holes=0, approximate shape (tall thin vertical).  
   - Effect: Position y shifts upward (reduced by ~4-10 units); interacts with Maroon frame by adjoining left edge and with background fills by partial overlap for depth.  
   - Consistent: Always left-aligned; no x-shift observed.

4. **Right tall block → Right-side output panel (position shift and preservation)**  
   - The tall block on the right in input (color varies: Yellow/Green/Pink; bbox right x ~16-23, mid-height y ~6-19, pixels=24-44, holes=0) transforms into a similar right-side tall panel in output (same color, bbox right x ~16-23 or 18-21, upper y ~3-13 or 5-10, same pixels).  
   - Preserved: Color, pixels (exact match), holes=0, approximate shape (tall vertical or block).  
   - Effect: Position y shifts upward (reduced by ~4-8 units); sometimes minor x-adjustment leftward; interacts with Maroon frame by adjoining right edge and with background fills by partial overlap.  
   - Consistent: Always right-aligned post-transformation.

5. **Bottom horizontal block → Upper-bottom output bar (position shift and preservation)**  
   - The horizontal block at bottom in input (color varies: Red/Yellow/Yellow; bbox central x ~4-21, bottom y ~22-24 or 23-24, pixels=24-42, holes=0) transforms into a similar central horizontal bar in output (same color, bbox central x ~4-21 or 5-12 or 8-21, mid-height y ~16-18, same pixels).  
   - Preserved: Color, pixels (exact match), holes=0, shape (wide horizontal).  
   - Effect: Position y shifts upward significantly (reduced by ~4-6 units); interacts with background fills by sitting atop them and with Maroon frame by being enclosed below it.  
   - Consistent: Always central x-alignment; no width change.

6. **Mid horizontal block (when present) → Top horizontal output bar (position shift and preservation)**  
   - The horizontal block mid-field in input (present in Train 2 and 3, not in Train 1; color Pink/Green, bbox central x ~8-20, mid y ~6-9, pixels=10-40, holes=0) transforms into a central top horizontal bar in output (same color, bbox central x ~8-17 or 13-17, top y ~0-3 or 0-1, same pixels).  
   - Preserved: Color, pixels (exact match), holes=0, shape (wide horizontal).  
   - Effect: Position shifts upward to top (y reduced to ~0-3); interacts with Maroon frame by adjoining top edge and with background fills by overlay if no mid input (in Train 1, top uses background color instead).  
   - Consistent: Only when present; otherwise, top uses background color (interaction with absence noted).

### Unknown or Inconsistent Interactions
- **Top small vertical colored bars (4x, pixels=4 each)**: Always present in input Orange bbox (colors and x-positions vary: e.g., x~1-22), but no consistent transformation to output components. Colors sometimes match output panels (e.g., left small color to left panel in Train 1 and 2), but not in every case (e.g., no match in Train 3 right). Pixels do not preserve (output tops have pixels=10-42). Positions may divide top space, but no consistent effect on output divisions or colors observed. Flagged as unknown interaction.
- **Holes in large background**: Vary (1-2 in input), but no consistent effect on output holes (Maroon frame holes 0-2, no direct mapping).
- **Orange top bar (holes=4)**: Consistent in input, but no observed interaction or transformation to output (discarded; no color or hole propagation).

[2025-10-01 23:11:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 24-column grid (likely 19 rows shown in outputs) where colored bars (extracted from the second row of the input grid) define protected zones, and sequences of 8's (representing a spreading "ink" or "flood" element) expand horizontally within their rows only under a specific merge condition (if bar 2 or 3 is color 6), stopping at protected colors or edges, while leaving other numbers (like 1,2,3,4, etc.) intact unless overwritten by the spread.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid g is a List[List[int]] with at least 25 rows (indices 0-24), but the output focuses on rows 6-24 (19 rows), copying them initially and modifying only where 8's are present.
 * Bar colors (1-4) are extracted from specific segments of row 1 (indices 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22), taking the first non-zero value in each; these bars act as blockers for spreading, along with color 5 (a universal protector, possibly a special barrier).
 * Spreading only activates if has_merge is true (bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6), indicating a "merge" event that allows 8's to propagate; without this, the grid is returned unchanged.
 * When spreading in a row with 8's: identify contiguous sequences of 8's, then expand left from the start and right from the end, overwriting non-protected cells (anything not in {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5}) until hitting a protected cell or edge; this must be done per row independently, and only affects rows containing at least one 8.
 * Subtlety: Spreading does not cross protected cells, even if they are not bars (e.g., stops at existing 1's or other numbers if they match protected set); it also doesn't spread vertically—only horizontal per row.
 * Easy to miss: The protected set is dynamic per puzzle (based on bars), and 0's in row 1 are ignored for bar extraction; spreading overwrites blanks or other fillable cells but preserves protected ones; in some cases, 8's appear to "connect" across gaps only if unprotected.
 * Other considerations: Grids have repeating rows (e.g., three identical rows of bars or fillers), suggesting vertical stacking or patterns; numbers like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 represent distinct colors/objects that shouldn't be altered unless spread into; the puzzle may involve "ink" filling regions bounded by bars, but only triggers on merge.
 * From examples: Spreading creates "blobs" of 8's that respect bar boundaries (e.g., in ex1, 8's fill between bars but stop at 1's/4's if protected); non-merge cases might do nothing; test input has 9's as a new color, possibly a bar or filler, and partial 8's that should spread if merge applies.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bar_colors(g):
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next(c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0)
    bar2 = next(c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0)
    bar3 = next(c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0)
    bar4 = next(c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts bar colors correctly from fixed positions in row 1, ignoring 0's; useful for defining protectors.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2, bar3):
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(This checks the merge condition accurately; essential to gate the spreading logic, as non-merge outputs should be unchanged.)

(The main program structure—copying rows 6:25, checking merge, defining protected set, and iterating rows for spreading—is a good skeleton, but the spreading implementation is flawed as detailed below. No types like classes are used, but a protected set is helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and extracts bar colors via get_bar_colors, which matches the positional logic seen in examples (e.g., bars at columns 1-4,7-10,etc., with non-zero first value).
 * has_merge works as a trigger, preventing changes in non-merge cases (though all examples seem to be merge cases).
 * The protected set {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5} is a good idea, capturing blockers like bars and a special 5.
 * However, spreading logic is broken: it over-spreads 8's across entire rows or sections, ignoring actual protected cells in the row (e.g., in train1, it fills huge swaths with 8's and even changes non-8 areas to 3's incorrectly, instead of stopping at existing 1's/4's; expected has isolated 8 pairs like positions 8-9 and 16-17).
 * In train1: Generated has full rows of 3's at top and massive 8 blocks in rows 7-8, but expected has targeted 8's (e.g., rows 0-2: 8's only at cols 8-9,16-17; row 9: 8's at 4-5,8-9 but stops before protected 3's/4's); difference is over-filling and wrong base colors (3's where 8's shouldn't go).
 * In train2: Generated spreads 8's too far in rows 8-9 (full blocks), but expected has more precise 8's (e.g., row 0: 8's at 4-5,8-9; row 2: wide 8's from col 13-21 but starting from existing); also fails to spread into some gaps (e.g., row 4 has no 8's in generated but expected has them); introduces wrong 1's in bar areas.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly fills with 7's in early rows and over-spreads 8's in row 11-12, but expected has 8's integrated with 7's as blockers (e.g., row 0: 8's at 3-4,18-19; row 4: full 8's but stopping at 7's); misses connecting 8's across minor gaps while respecting 7/6 bars.
 * Overall: Attempt demonstrates understanding of bars, merge, and horizontal spreading concept, but fails on precise boundary detection (spreads past existing protected numbers like 1/3/4/6/7 if they match set but doesn't check per-cell in row); the while loops for left/right spread use row[] for checks but new_row for writes, causing overwrite issues or skipping; no handling for multiple 8 sequences per row properly.
 * get_bar_colors and has_merge are helpful and correct—keep them; the spreading loop is unhelpful/broken (over-aggressive, doesn't preserve non-8 non-protected cells correctly, and mutates incorrectly)—avoid reusing as-is.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It mostly copies the input with minimal changes (e.g., rows 0-2 full of 2's unchanged; rows 3-6 full 9's; only partial 8's in row 7 at cols 8-10, but no spreading despite likely merge), resulting in isolated 8's and untouched 9's/4's, which mismatches the pattern of controlled 8 expansion seen in training expecteds (e.g., should spread 8's left/right from row 7's position 8-10 into adjacent 9's if unprotected, potentially filling between bars like cols 4-11 or similar, stopping at 1's or extracted bars; instead, it leaves most 9's intact and doesn't propagate, suggesting the merge check passed but spreading failed to activate/execute properly).
 * Differences: No wide 8 blobs as in training expecteds (e.g., expected likely has 8's expanding in rows 7+ to connect or fill regions bounded by 1's/9's/3's, especially row 17-18 where 4's are, possibly overwriting some 9's but not 1's/3's); the output feels like a near-copy with buggy partial 8 insert, missing the "flood" effect; 9's seem treated as non-protected but not filled, indicating the spread logic doesn't target them correctly.
 * To handle test: Ensure spreading checks every row with 8's (row 7 here), uses the correct protected set (bars likely 2/9/?/3 or similar from row 1, plus 5), and propagates only horizontally without altering non-8 rows; mentally, if bar2 or 3 is 6, 8's in row 7 should spread left to col 4 (stop at 1's?) and right to col 11 (stop at 9's if protected), creating a blob like [1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,...].

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the task is to overlay or insert a special color (8) to highlight or connect specific linear or banded patterns, likely representing outlines, borders, or extensions of existing colored regions across horizontal bands of similar rows. The goal is to transform the input grid by replacing background or gap cells with 8's in precise positions to form paired or extended lines, while preserving other colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of horizontal "bands" of identical or near-identical rows, and processing must group these bands to identify patterns like runs of non-background colors.
 * 8's are placed specifically to form short pairs (e.g., two consecutive 8's) or extend existing lines, often adjacent to non-background runs of width <=4, but only in certain directions (e.g., right of left-side runs or left of right-side runs), and sometimes filling full horizontal segments in stacked bands.
 * Background color (most common cell value) must be ignored when detecting runs; runs are sequences of the same non-background color.
 * Subtlety: 8's often appear in positions that "bridge" or outline shapes across bands, such as vertical alignments (e.g., columns 8-9 and 16-17 in train 1), but not always full rows—e.g., in train 1 row 9, 8's are interrupted by 3's in specific columns.
 * Another subtlety: In stacked bands, 8's can propagate vertically or fill entire row segments if aligned (e.g., full 8 rows in train 1 rows 7-8), but only where patterns match across bands; isolated bands don't get full fills.
 * Placement rules seem tied to grid width (e.g., references to column 12 suggest a 24-column grid midpoint), with left-side runs (start <12) extending right, and right-side runs extending left, but only if width conditions are met and color != background.
 * Easy to miss: Existing 8's in input should be preserved or extended, but new 8's only replace background; overfilling (e.g., replacing non-background with 8's) breaks the output.
 * Vertical alignment is key—8's must match column positions across multiple rows in a band for consistency (e.g., train 2 has 8 pairs in columns 4-5, 8-9, 14-15).
 * Bands may have interruptions (e.g., train 1 row 9 has 8's with 3's in between), so run detection must handle non-uniform rows within a "band" of mostly similar rows.
 * No vertical processing in current code—puzzle likely requires checking alignments across bands, not just within rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty or short grids return empty; top 6 rows seem ignored (header?); color 8 has special handling (e.g., width >=2 triggers pairs).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for ignoring it in run detection.)

```python
def get_bands(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    bands = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        j = i
        while j < n and grid[j] == grid[i]:
            j += 1
        pattern = grid[i]
        runs = []
        k = 0
        m = len(pattern)
        while k < m:
            if pattern[k] == get_background(grid):
                k += 1
                continue
            color = pattern[k]
            start = k
            while k < m and pattern[k] == color:
                k += 1
            end = k - 1
            width = end - start + 1
            runs.append((start, end, color, width))
        bands.append((i, j - i, runs))
        i = j
    return bands
```
(This groups identical rows into bands and extracts non-background runs with positions and widths, useful for identifying candidate line positions; however, it assumes perfectly identical rows in bands, which may not hold if rows have minor variations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (3 in train 1, 1 in train 2, 7 in train 3) and groups rows into bands, which works for detecting horizontal patterns.
 * Run extraction in get_bands skips background and captures widths/colors, helpful for spotting short runs (<=4) that might need extension.
 * find_line_pairs attempts to detect positions for 8 pairs based on color 8 (width>=2) or short non-bg runs, adding adjacent positions (e.g., right of left runs), which partially aligns with pair placements but fails to propagate vertically or fill aligned segments.
 * In program, it copies the grid and only replaces bg with 8's in rows with detected pairs, using min/max columns to fill segments— this overfills horizontally (e.g., full 8's from col 4-20 in train 1 row 7) instead of precise pairs.
 * Train 1 generated: Overfilled rows 7-8 and 9 with continuous 8's in cols 4-17, ignoring interruptions (expected has pairs at 8-9,16-17 with 3's elsewhere; also missed upper pairs and lower extensions like row 12-15).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Rows 0-2 all 3's (correct, no change), but rows 3-6 should have pairs starting at row 3, not just lower; row 9 has full 8's instead of interrupted (8,8,3,3,8,8,3,3); rows 12-15 missed entirely (expected 8 pairs); bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 2 generated: Filled cols 4-15 with 8's in rows 7-8 and 10, but expected has pairs at specific columns (4-5,8-9,14-15) across more rows (e.g., rows 0-1,3-4,5-8,9-10); missed vertical extensions in row 2 (full 8's cols 14-21); row 14 has full 8's cols 8-21 (wrong, expected pairs).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper rows 0-1 have no 8's (expected pairs); row 2 all 1's (expected long 8's); rows 11-12 missed pairs; bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 3 generated: Filled cols 3-19 with 8's in rows 11-12, but expected has more distributed pairs (e.g., cols 3-4,13-14 in upper rows); rows 4-7 all 7's (missed 8 extensions); row 16 has 8's only in detected band (wrong positions).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Rows 0-2 have 3's unchanged (expected pairs at 3-4,18-19); rows 4-6 all 7's (expected full 8's cols 0-7,19-20); row 6 has partial (expected more); rows 13-15 missed pairs and full 8's; function assumes exact row equality for bands, but train 3 row 6 differs slightly from above.
 * Overall, program ignores vertical alignment across bands, leading to no propagation (e.g., no 8's in upper bands of train 1); line_pairs only adds single adjacent cells, not pairs or fills.
 * find_line_pairs is broken/not helpful: It adds (start, start+1) for color 8 width>=2 (but start is run start, so wrong positions); for other runs, adds single cells adjacent but not pairs, and only if start<12 or end>11 (midpoint logic partial but incomplete); doesn't handle full fills or interruptions.
 * get_bands is mostly helpful but skips bg in runs correctly; however, doesn't handle near-identical bands (e.g., if rows differ by 1 cell).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills large horizontal segments with 8's (e.g., rows 7-9 cols 3-20 full 8's, row 13 cols 3-20 full 9's unchanged but should likely get pairs) instead of precise pairs or aligned extensions, similar to training errors.
 * In test, top rows 0-2 all 2's (likely correct, no change); rows 3-5 all 9's (correct); row 6 has 1's in cols 0-2 then 9's (partial, but expected probably 8 pairs around the 1's); rows 7-9 overfilled with 8's across most cols (expected pairs like cols 3-4, perhaps 12-13 based on pattern); rows 10-12 1's then 9's (missed 8's); rows 13-15 full 9's in cols 3+ (wrong, likely need pairs); rows 16-17 all 9's (correct?); rows 18-20 have 4's in cols 7-15 (unchanged, but may need 8 outlines); bottom all 9's (correct). It ignores vertical patterns (e.g., the left 1's in rows 6-12 suggest a vertical shape needing 8 borders on right).
 * No vertical propagation: The 1's on left in rows 6-12 align vertically, likely needing 8 pairs to the right (e.g., cols 3-4), but output only fills in row 7-9 band; bottom 4's band unchanged despite being a distinct run.
 * Overfilling bg with 8's in detected bands, but test has bg=9 (most common), so runs of 2/1/4 should trigger specific pair placements, not full rows; misses potential full 8 rows if aligned across bands (none here, but code doesn't check).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to generate a modified version of a subgrid (rows 6-24) by spreading a special "ink" or filler (value 8) from initial seeds or patterns, influenced by background color detection, vertical bars with specific colors (like 6 indicating merges), and rules for expanding 8's into adjacent background cells while preserving other structures like colored blocks or bars.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a background color (most common value across the entire input grid), which 8's can spread into horizontally in affected rows, but only adjacent to existing 8's or seeds; spreading does not overwrite non-background cells (e.g., colored blocks like 1's, 3's, 4's, or bars).
 * Vertical bars (likely in fixed columns like 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22 based on code attempts) have colors that trigger rules: a bar color of 6 in bar2 or bar3 indicates a "merge" mode, which seeds additional 8's in specific column pairs across all output rows where the background is present.
 * Initial seeds for 8's come from finding consecutive 8's (length >=2) in the input subgrid rows; during merge, seed two adjacent columns (e.g., start and start+1 of the first such pair found) with 8's in all rows if those positions are background.
 * Spreading of 8's is horizontal only, expanding left/right from clusters of 8's into background, but only applied to rows that originally contain at least one 8 in the input; this can create filled horizontal bands or connect sections.
 * Subtleties: Merges create vertical "pillars" of 8's that then spread horizontally in subsequent rows; not all rows spread equally—some expected outputs show partial spreading (e.g., only left or right sides), and 8's can form large connected blobs vertically/horizontally but respect block boundaries. Bars and blocks (e.g., sequences of same color like 1's or 4's) must not be overwritten. In non-merge cases, spreading might be minimal or absent. Easy to miss: seed positions are column-based across all rows, but spreading is per-row; background detection uses the whole grid, including non-subgrid rows. Also, 8's in input might already be present, and spreading should chain (e.g., fill gaps between multiple 8 clusters in a row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where initial pair is not found (return None, no seeding); spreading must skip over non-background (e.g., don't spread into a 4-block); vertical alignment of 8's from seeding must propagate spreading in lower rows; in merge, seeding happens before spreading, and only in background positions.

            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] == background:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j  # Skip to after expansion
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The main `program` function integrates the above but is broken: it seeds only if merge and pair found, but applies seeding by setting to 8 only if background (good), yet spreads only on rows with original 8's (misses seeded rows); also, out = copy of subgrid before seeding, so seeding adds 8's but spreading check uses original g, leading to incomplete propagation. Not helpful as-is—needs fixing for vertical seeding to trigger spreading in all rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core logic for seeding and spreading is incomplete or misapplied.
 * In Training 1 (background likely 3): Generated correctly copied subgrid and detected bars/background, and spread some 8's in rows with original 8's (e.g., positions 8-9 filled consistently), but failed to seed additional 8's in columns 16-17 for top rows (expected has 8,8 there, generated has 3,3); also missed left-spreading in rows like index 9-11 (generated [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,8,8,...]) and full horizontal 8-band in rows 14-15 (generated partial 8,8 at 8-9, expected full 8's from 4-23). In bottom rows 16-18, no spreading issues as no 8's. Merge likely triggered (bar2/bar3=6?), but seeding used wrong pair or didn't apply vertically enough.
 * In Training 2 (background likely 1): Generated spread some 8's horizontally where original 8's present (e.g., row 5 has 8,8 at 8-9), and seeded nothing visibly, but expected shows seeding 8's at columns 4-5 and 8-9 early, plus a full 8-band in row 2 (positions 12-23), and left-spreading in row 4 (8's at 4-5,8-9,12-15?); generated missed vertical pillars (e.g., row 0 expected 8,8 at 4-5 but generated 1,1) and spreading in row 14 (expected full 8-band from 8-23, generated only 8,8 at 8-9). Merge triggered but initial pair detection failed or seeding didn't propagate spreading to non-original-8 rows.
 * In Training 3 (background likely 7): Generated spread 8's in some places (e.g., row 11 has full 8-band), but missed seeding 8's at columns 3-4 and 19-20 in top rows (expected 8,8 there vs generated 7,7); also incomplete vertical spreading (e.g., row 4 expected full 8-band from 0-13 vs generated partial 7's and 8,8 at 12-13); row 13 expected 8's at 3-4 and 12-13 with 6's preserved, but generated wrong. Bottom rows correct as no 8's. Merge triggered, but pair selection wrong (used existing 8's instead of specific merge positions).
 * extract_objects not present in attempts, but bar/background detection is essential and partially works; spread_row is helpful but broken for chaining full expansions and applying to seeded rows.
 * Common miss: Seeding doesn't trigger spreading in rows without original 8's; initial pair always picks first consecutive 8's, but expected suggests merge-specific positions (e.g., fixed columns or different pairs per example). Spreading doesn't handle vertical connections implicitly—needs per-row after seeding.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples. It shows heavy spreading of 8's in row 7 (full 8-band from 3-21?), but minimal elsewhere (e.g., top rows all 2's except bottom 3's, rows 3-5 all 9's, row 6 partial 1's then 9's, rows 8-10 full 8's but then back to 9's, row 16 full 9's, rows 17-18 partial 4's in middle). This mismatches expected behavior: if merge triggered (assuming bars include 6), we'd expect vertical 8-pillars seeding columns (e.g., 3-4 or similar) across all rows, then horizontal spreading into background (likely 9 or 2/3), creating more connected 8-regions (e.g., bands in top/mid rows like training); instead, it seems spreading only hit isolated rows, missing propagation (e.g., no 8's bleeding from row 7 to 6/8 fully, and bottom 4-block untouched but should spread if adjacent). No full bands in expected-like positions (e.g., row 14 in training 1/2), and abrupt shifts (e.g., row 6 has 1's at 0-2 then 9's, but row 7 jumps to 8's) suggest incomplete seeding or background misdetection. To handle test, need to apply spreading to ALL rows after seeding, not just original-8 rows, and possibly detect multiple seed pairs or fixed merge columns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely 25 rows total, but focusing on rows 6-24 for output) where the number 8 represents a spreading element (like ink or flood fill) that originates from initial pairs of adjacent 8's and expands horizontally in rows, while respecting "protected" areas defined by colored bars (non-zero values in specific bar positions) and the value 5. The spreading is conditional on a "merge" condition (when bar2 or bar3 is 6), and the goal is to simulate row-by-row evolution of the grid over 19 steps, avoiding overwriting protected cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses numbers as colors/states: 8 is the spreading agent that fills empty/unprotected spaces (likely 0's, though not explicitly shown); other numbers (1-9) are fixed colors or barriers that shouldn't be overwritten.
 * Bars are extracted from row 1 (g[1]), in fixed segments: bar1 (cols 1-4), bar2 (7-10), bar3 (13-16), bar4 (19-22), taking the first non-zero in each— these and 5 are protected from spreading.
 * Spreading only happens if there's a merge (bar2==6 or bar3==6); otherwise, output the original subgrid unchanged.
 * Initial 8-pair detection: Scan rows 6-24 for the first adjacent pair of 8's (positions i and i+1); this pair seeds spreading in subsequent rows if no existing 8's are present.
 * Spreading mechanic: In each row (starting from the row with the initial pair), if a row already has 8's, expand them left/right until hitting protected cells (bars or 5); if no 8's, place 8's at the initial pair positions (if unprotected). This is done sequentially for 19 output rows, but spreading seems cumulative or stateful across rows in some way (e.g., once spread in one row, it influences later rows).
 * Subtlety: Spreading is horizontal only, per row, but the simulation is over time (19 steps), so early rows may show initial seeds, while later rows show full expansion; however, the code treats it as independent per row with global initial pair.
 * Edge cases: Protected cells block spread but aren't overwritten; if initial pair positions are protected, don't place 8's there; bars can be 0 (no protection in that segment?); value 6 in bars triggers merge mode.
 * Rows are 24 elements long (0-indexed cols 0-23); output is exactly 19 rows (g[6:25] processed).
 * Potential misses: Spreading might need to propagate vertically or based on prior row states (code assumes independent rows); initial pair is global but applied per row without 8's; over-spreading into protected areas; missing right-side seeds in some examples (e.g., training 1 has initial 8's on right not detected); merge condition might enable bi-directional or full-grid spread.
 * Unclear: Exact input grid structure (full g not shown, but rows 6+ are the evolving part); what 0 represents (empty?); why some expected rows have sudden full 8 spreads (e.g., row 14 in training 1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)
    bar2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    bar3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    bar4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts bar colors correctly from fixed positions in row 1, useful for protection.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2: int, bar3: int) -> bool:
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(Simple but key condition to enable/disable spreading mode.)

```python
def get_initial_pair(g: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for row in g[6:25]:
        i = 0
        n = len(row)
        while i < n - 1:
            if row[i] == 8 and row[i + 1] == 8:
                return (i, i + 1)
            i += 1
    return None
```
(Detects the first adjacent 8-pair across the subgrid; helpful for seeding, but may miss multiple pairs or right-side ones like in training 1.)

```python
def spread_row(row: List[int], protected: set) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row.copy()
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(Expands existing 8-blocks left/right until protected; core spreading logic, but assumes input row already has 8's—doesn't handle seeding new 8's.)

The main `program` function orchestrates: computes bars/protected, checks merge, finds pair, then per row: if has 8's spread them, else seed pair if possible; outputs 19 rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; all three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding.
 * Worked: Correctly detects bars and protected set (including 5); implements horizontal spreading from existing 8's without overwriting protected; finds initial 8-pair and seeds it in rows without 8's; skips processing if no merge.
 * Didn't work: Spreading/seeding is too limited—applies initial pair globally to all non-8 rows without progression (e.g., doesn't simulate time-based growth from prior rows); over-spreads in some cases (e.g., training 1 row 7-8 fills entire middle with 8's, but expected has gaps); misses additional seeds (e.g., training 1 has right-side 8's at cols 16-17 not detected/spread initially); in non-merge? Wait, all examples seem to have merge but code assumes it.
 * Training 1 differences: Generated keeps initial 8's at cols 8-9 but misses right-side 8's (cols 16-17 in expected rows 0-6); row 8 spreads left to cols 4-7 (3's become 8's) but expected keeps them as 3's until later; row 9 reverts to 3's instead of keeping partial 8's (expected has 8's at 4-5 and 8-9); row 14 has no spread (all 3's) vs expected full 8's cols 4-21; bottom rows match (2's appear correctly, likely from input).
 * Training 2 differences: No initial spread to cols 4-5 (expected has 8's there from row 0); row 2 clears middle 8's too early (expected keeps and spreads right to cols 13-21); row 4 has no right spread (expected full 8's cols 13-21); row 10 reverts middle without left 8's (expected has 8's at 4-5); row 14 spreads bottom but misses full 8's in middle (expected cols 8-21); function assumes single pair but example has multiple seed areas.
 * Training 3 differences: Misses initial left 8's at cols 3-4 (expected from row 0); row 4 spreads too much left (fills cols 0-7 with 7's? Wait, generated has 7's but expected 8's); row 6 keeps partial but expected full 8's cols 0-11; row 11 over-spreads to full 8's cols 3-19 but expected only around seeds; row 14 misses right spread (expected 8's at 18-19); row 15 changes right to 7's too early vs expected 8's persisting.
 * `get_initial_pair` is helpful but broken for multiple pairs (returns only first, misses right-side in train1/2); `spread_row` is useful but doesn't handle seeding or vertical influence; main loop processes rows independently without state carryover (likely why spreads don't progress cumulatively).
 * No unhelpful functions— all provided are relevant, but `get_initial_pair` needs enhancement for all seeds.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows minimal 8's (only in rows 7-8 at cols 8-10, from apparent seed) and over-relies on input colors (lots of 2's top, 9's middle/bottom, 4's late), but spreading seems absent or blocked entirely after initial, with no progression (e.g., rows 0-2 all 2's, then sudden 9's in row 3 without transition; row 7 has partial 8's but row 10 reverts to 9's; row 17 has 4's starting at col 7 but no 8 integration). This mismatches puzzle expectation of gradual 8-spread if merge is true (assuming bars include 6 somewhere, not shown); likely misses detecting/handling initial pair (possibly at cols 8-9 based on 8's placement) and full horizontal expansion around it, plus no cumulative effect across rows (e.g., 8's should fill more of the 9's area over time). Without full input grid, hard to confirm exact expected, but patterns from training suggest more 8-filling in middle rows (e.g., around cols 4-20) before late 4's/9's dominate; current output feels static/input-copying rather than simulated evolution.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 24x24 grid where non-background components from rows 6+ are translated upward by 6 rows to form a new structure at the top, while adding structural "maroon" elements (color 8) as beams, pillars, and anchors based on the position and gaps around a key maroon bounding box; the background color fills the rest, and lower sections may include additional beams or translated elements depending on bottom components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected groups of the same color (4-directional adjacency), ignoring colors 0 and 5 (likely empty or invalid); only consider components starting from row 6 downward to avoid upper grid noise.
 * Background is the largest component by pixel count; exclude it and color 8 (maroon/structural) from translation, but only translate components with 24-63 pixels (suggesting rectangular or mid-sized objects; smaller/larger may be ignored or treated differently).
 * Maroon (8) acts as an "anchor" – compute its bounding box (bbox) only in rows 6+; shift it up by 6 rows, then derive "beams" by finding the leftmost/rightmost gaps (empty background columns) adjacent to the anchor's columns at the anchor's shifted row height.
 * Beams (horizontal 8's) fill from beam_left to beam_right across the anchor's shifted row range; upper pillars (vertical 8's) extend beams downward from fixed starts (e.g., columns 8 and 16 if anchor_slot==2, else beam edges), always placing as support even over other colors.
 * Lower pillars extend from beam ends and anchor base downward to row 23, only overwriting background (not other colors).
 * Lower beam: Placed one row above the highest row of the bottommost translated component; its extent varies by anchor_slot (e.g., full width if slot==2 and relative3==1, else to anchor max_c); only overwrite background.
 * Top bars: Uniform color columns in rows 1-4 (excluding 0,5) may indicate slots or relative positions (e.g., bars[2]-12 for relative3); anchor_slot = min_c // 6 (likely 0-3 for positioning logic).
 * Subtle: Pillars/beams can overwrite translated components in some cases (upper always, lower only bg); bottom component is the one with max row in cells (after shift); if no translated, default bg=3 but this may not trigger.
 * Edge cases: Anchor may not span full height/width; beams/pillars widths are fixed (e.g., pillar_width=2) or derived (anchor_width); relative3 uses top bars (assumes 4 bars); test inputs may have varying bg (e.g., 3,1,7) and need to preserve non-8 translations accurately.
 * Potential misses: Overwriting non-bg in lower areas blocks pillar extension; incorrect beam_left/right if no gap (defaults to 0/23); lower beam row calc (bottom_min_r -1) may go negative/out-of-bounds; components <24 or >63 pixels ignored (e.g., small debris or large bg-like); top bars assume exactly 4, else relative3=1 (may fail if fewer bars).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def get_components(g: List[List[int]], start_row: int = 6) -> list[dict]:
    # Uses DFS/stack to find connected components of same color from start_row down, excluding 0/5.

def get_translated_rectangles(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> list[dict]:
    # Filters components: not bg, not 8, 24<=pixels<=63.

```

```python
def get_bottom_component(translated: list[dict]) -> dict:
    # Max by highest row in cells (for lower beam row = that_min_r -6 -1).
    # Helpful: Positions lower beam just above bottom translated object.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of structural additions (beams/pillars) and overwriting rules.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8's in upper-left (cols 4-5, rows 0-2/12-23) where expected has bg (3); missed full 8 beam in row 14 (cols 4-23); no 2's in rows 16-18 (expected bottom translated?); lower pillars/beam incomplete or wrong extent; translated 1's and 4's mostly correct but beams overwrite incorrectly.
 * Train 1: Top bars and relative3 logic placed pillars wrong (e.g., left_upper_start=8 but generated starts at 4); beam_left/right miscalc (used shifted_min_r=7? leading to left_trans_right wrong); lower beam row wrong (placed at row 11? but expected none, instead full 8's lower).
 * Train 2: Generated bg=1 correctly but filled lower rows (12-23) entirely with 1's/bg where expected has 8 beams (rows 14-15 cols 8-23), 4's (rows 16-18 cols 5-13), and 6's (rows 0-2 cols 13-17); missed translating/preserving 6's and 4's properly; pillars/beams only in upper, no lower extension; top bars logic failed (bars likely at cols 4,14? but relative3 wrong).
 * Train 2: Bottom component (likely 4's) not used for lower beam (expected row 15 full 8's); beam_left/right calc ignored gaps around anchor (min_c~8?); overwrote nothing in lower, leaving all bg.
 * Train 3: Generated mismatched top (7's instead of 3's in cols 8-17 rows 0-2); extra 8's in row 4 cols 0-3/20-23; wrong pillar widths (e.g., row 6 cols 3-7 as 8's but expected 7's); missed full 8's in row 4 cols 0-23?; bottom 4's in rows 16-18 cols 8-21 correct but surrounding 7's wrong; 6's translated but pillar overwrite incomplete.
 * Train 3: Bg=7 correct, but anchor bbox miscalc (min_c~0? leading to slot=0, wrong upper starts); relative3 from bars wrong (bars at 8,18?); lower beam not placed (expected none, but generated partial); function get_maroon_bbox scans correctly but beam fill uses wrong r_anchor.
 * Overall: Translation of non-8 components works partially (positions/sizes ok in upper), but beam/pillar placement fails due to incorrect gap detection (left_trans_right/right_trans_left often defaults wrong); lower logic (pillars only on bg, beam extent by slot/relative3) inconsistent; size filter 24-63 may exclude key elements (e.g., Train 2's 6's or 4's?); top bars assume 4 but may vary.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but get_top_bars assumes uniform rows 1-4 (may miss if not uniform); beam calc in program() fragile (uses single r_anchor, may miss if anchor not uniform height; left_trans_right scans only left of min_c but may find wrong edge if multiple components).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have translated components upward (e.g., 9's from lower to rows 3-5/13-23, 1's to rows 6-10/11-12, 3's as bg in cols 21-23), and placed some 8 pillars/beams (cols 3-4 throughout, row 7 cols 5-19 as 8's), but inconsistencies suggest errors: upper rows 0-2 have 2's in cols 0-2/5-19 where likely bg or different translation expected (2's may be unfiltered small component); row 5 has mixed 8's and 9's breaking beam continuity; lower rows 13-23 have 9's overwriting potential pillars (e.g., cols 5-20 should be 8's if lower pillars extend, but 9's persist); no clear lower beam (e.g., above bottom 9's at row 23, expected row 22 full 8's?); right side cols 19-20 have 8's but then 3's abruptly, suggesting wrong beam_right (gap detection failed around anchor min_c~?); overall, lacks full structural support (beams/pillars not spanning anchor bbox properly), and 3's in lower-right may be bg but positioned as if untranslated debris; does not match puzzle rules as beams/pillars seem partial/underfilled, and small 2's/3's suggest size filter or component detection missed filtering.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the number 8 (likely representing a spreading "ink" or fill) must be propagated or "spread" across certain rows in a subgrid (rows 6-24 of a larger grid), while respecting barriers defined by colored bars, protected cells, and special merge conditions. The goal is to transform the input grid by filling unprotected areas with 8s based on initial seeds or pairs, but avoiding overwriting specific colors or structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a header row (g[1]) with bar colors in specific segments (e.g., columns 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22, skipping zeros), which define protected colors that 8s cannot overwrite during spreading.
 * Protected set includes bar colors plus 5 (possibly a universal barrier or empty space indicator).
 * Merge condition triggers only if bar2 or bar3 is 6, potentially allowing special placement of initial 8 pairs in rows without existing 8s.
 * Initial pair detection looks for the first consecutive pair of 8s (count >=2) in subgrid rows, but placement is conditional on merge and only in rows lacking any 8s originally; however, this seems overly restrictive and doesn't propagate the pair across rows.
 * Spreading function expands contiguous 8s left/right until hitting protected cells or grid edges, but only applied to rows that originally contain 8s; it skips rows without 8s except via the pair logic.
 * Subtleties: Spreading is row-wise only (no vertical propagation), and initial seeds might need to be placed or detected differently—e.g., pairs may indicate starting points for vertical or multi-row fills. Protected cells block but don't get filled. Bars might represent dividers that 8s can't cross vertically or horizontally. In examples, 8s often form blobs or lines that align with non-protected areas, suggesting connected component filling. Easy to miss: Some rows need 8s inserted even without originals if they align with vertical continuity from above/below; merge=6 might enable crossing a central barrier. Original 8s must be preserved and expanded, but not all empty (0 or other) cells get filled—only those adjacent to 8s. Grid is 19 rows deep for subgrid, but spreading doesn't handle multi-row connectivity well.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)
    bar2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    bar3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    bar4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts the four bar colors correctly from header, useful for defining protected sets.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2: int, bar3: int) -> bool:
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(Simple but key for detecting special merge cases that allow extra 8 placements.)

```python
def spread_row(row: List[int], protected: set) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row.copy()
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This performs horizontal spreading from existing 8 blocks, avoiding protected; core logic for expansion but limited to single rows and doesn't handle vertical.)

```python
def get_initial_pair(g: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for row in g[6:25]:

(Detects first pair of consecutive 8s for seeding, but returns only positions in one row; useful but incomplete as it doesn't propagate vertically or check all rows.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating the core spreading and seeding logic is flawed—e.g., it under-fills 8s in areas that should connect vertically or across barriers under merge conditions.
 * Train 1: Generated spread 8s correctly in some central rows (e.g., full 8s in rows 7-8 matching expected), but failed to place 8s in right-side positions (e.g., expected 8,8 in columns 16-17 for top rows, but generated 3,3; also missed vertical extension in rows 9-11 where expected 8,8 in cols 4-5 but generated 3,3; row 14 has no 8s in cols 4-7 where expected full 8s). Pair placement didn't trigger properly, and spreading didn't extend to non-original-8 rows. What worked: Protected 3 and 4 areas correctly; horizontal spreads in seeded rows.
 * Train 2: Generated initial 8,8 pairs in cols 8-9 correctly for top rows, but missed left-side 8s in cols 4-5 (expected 8,8 but generated 1,1); row 2 expected 8s in cols 14-21 but generated 6s/1s; central merge (bar3=6?) not handled to fill row 2 cols 14-21 with 8s; bottom rows under-filled (e.g., row 14 expected full 8s cols 8-23 but generated partial). What worked: Spread in row 8-9 full 8s; protected 1,3,6 areas. Pair detection missed or not applied vertically.
 * Train 3: Generated some 8 spreads (e.g., cols 12-13 in middle rows), but missed left extensions (e.g., top rows expected 8,8 in cols 3-4 but generated 7,7; row 4 expected 8,8 cols 3-4 but generated 7,7); row 5 over-filled with 7s where expected 8s cols 0-11; vertical blobs not connected (e.g., row 14 expected 8s cols 20-23 but generated 6s). What worked: Right-side 6 protections; some horizontal spreads in row 11-12. Merge (bar4=6?) not enabling cross-bar fills.
 * get_initial_pair is helpful for seeding but broken in application—only places in one row and only if no original 8s, missing vertical propagation; don't rely on it alone.
 * has_eight (checks if 8 in row) is simple but useful for identifying seed rows; however, the main program logic skips spreading on non-seed rows too aggressively.
 * Overall, attempts show understanding of bars/protected but fail on vertical connectivity, merge-enabled fills across central areas (e.g., when bar=6, 8s might bridge gaps), and inserting seeds in empty rows based on alignment rather than single pair.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it over-fills with 9s in many areas (e.g., rows 3-6 full 9s where 8s should spread instead, assuming 9 is a bar color but spreading logic treated it wrong); row 7 has 1s in cols 0-2 then full 8s, but if vertical from above, more 8s expected in left; rows 13-16 full 9s bottom-right, but spreading should stop at protected 3s in cols 21-23; row 17 full 9s, row 18 partial 4s in center but no 8s where seeds might start. It ignores potential vertical 8 propagation from row 7-10's 8s downward, and pair/merge not detected (no initial 8 pair found?). This suggests the program didn't extract bars correctly (bars seem 2 left, 9 center/right, 3/4 bottom), leading to wrong protected set; output looks like it copied input without proper 8 spreading, making it incoherent for a fill puzzle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to detect a background color, shift and clean the main content into a 19-row output grid, identify a central "maroon" object (color 8) bounding box, and then augment the grid by adding maroon (8) elements to form structural extensions like vertical risers, horizontal connectors, and bottom fills that frame or connect the maroon object to surrounding elements, while respecting spans, gaps, and conditional placements based on other non-background objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent non-0, non-5 color in the input's rows 6-23 (likely the "empty" or filler space); defaults to 3 if tied or unclear.
 * Content shifting extracts rows 6-23 of input into rows 0-18 of output, replacing 0s and 5s with background, and duplicates the last row if needed to fill 19 rows—ensures no original borders or artifacts remain.
 * Maroon object (color 8) bounding box (min/max row/col) is extracted from input rows 6-23, shifted to 0-based output coordinates; if absent, defaults to invalid (0,0,0,0) which may skip augmentations.
 * Horizontal span calculation for the maroon's y-range finds the minimal left/right bounds that cover all non-bg cells in that vertical slice, effectively determining a "coverage width" that may extend beyond the maroon itself to include nearby objects.
 * Upward verticals (risers) are placed as 8's above the maroon: always internal (over maroon cols), always right-aligned (shifted to end of span), and conditionally left-aligned if there's a left-side object whose vertical extent is close enough (distance <= maroon_width +1) to justify connection.
 * Horizontal shorts place 8's directly over the maroon and span positions within the maroon's y-range, but only on bg cells; gaps between sorted positions are connected horizontally with 8's in the y-range only if the entire gap above (rows 0 to y1-1) is clear of non-bg.
 * Downward verticals start right after maroon (y2+1) and extend to a fixed row 13; placed for internal (maroon cols), conditional left (if left object extends below maroon by >= maroon_width +1), and always right; if down height matches maroon height, full horizontal connection across all down positions in those rows.
 * Bottom full fill starts at row 14, height matching maroon height (up to row 18), spanning from leftmost down position to either full width (if no right extensions below row 13) or rightmost down position; only on bg cells.
 * Subtleties: All placements overwrite only bg cells (no overwriting existing content); connections require clear space above/below for verticals; fixed row limits (e.g., down to 13, bottom from 14) suggest a structured output height with distinct zones (top for risers, middle for object, bottom for base); spans must account for all non-bg in y-range to avoid narrow framing; left/right placements are asymmetric and conditional on nearby object extents (e.g., left_start_y, right_end_y, left_end_y); maroon_width drives many decisions (e.g., connection lengths); potential for overfilling if conditions misapplied, like placing left up/down too aggressively.
 * Edge cases: No maroon (skip augmentations?); maroon near edges (clamp to 0/width-1); varying object positions (left, center, right) affect span and connections; heights may not align perfectly, so fixed down_y2=13 acts as a cap; output is always 19 rows x input width, with last input row duplicated if short.
 * Across attempts: Preserve original non-8, non-bg content exactly (e.g., 1's, 2's, 4's, 6's, 9's); 8's only added, never removed; consider full-width bottoms only if no protruding right objects.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```
(This correctly identifies bg as most common non-0/5 in content area; useful for cleaning.)

    # copy last row
    if height_out > 0:
        grid[height_out - 1] = grid[height_out - 2][:]
    return grid
```
(This extracts and cleans content reliably; essential for base grid setup; duplication handles short inputs.)

(Computes effective horizontal coverage for y-range; key for determining frame width; but note potential off-by-one in end_span calc, as it sets to width-1 on no non-bg, which may overextend.)

                break
    return right_end_y
```
(Finds vertical extent of right-side objects after end col; useful for bottom span decisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly detects bg (e.g., 3 in train 1, 1 in train 2/3) and shifts content without artifacts, preserving original shapes like the 1's block, 2's base, 4's bottom in train 1.
 * Upward verticals partially work: internal and right placements add 8's correctly in many spots (e.g., train 1 rows 0-2 over maroon cols 8-9), but left up is overplaced or missing (train 1: no left 8's in rows 0-3 cols 0-4 where expected; train 2: misplaced left 8's in rows 0-2 cols 0-3 instead of cols 4-5).
 * Horizontal shorts/connects fail consistently: shorts overplace 8's (train 1 rows 4-11 cols 0-3 have 1's unchanged but expected 8's in rows 7-8 cols 4-7; no connection between left/middle in row 12); gaps not connected properly (train 2: no horizontal 8's in row 2 cols 11-19 where expected full connect; train 3: overconnects in rows 4-6 cols 0-7 with 7's unchanged to 8's incorrectly).
 * Downward verticals are incomplete: internal/right placed but left conditional wrong (train 1: no left down 8's in rows 12-13 cols 0-3; train 3: down in rows 12-13 cols 12-13 correct but no full connect); height match for full down connect misapplied (train 2: down height=3 but no wide 8's in rows 11-13 cols 4-20).
 * Bottom full miscalculates span/end: overfills or underfills (train 1: rows 14-16 cols 0-23 with 8's but expected only partial; train 3: row 14-16 cols 0-3 and 8-23 but generated full 8's incorrectly; train 2: no bottom 8's at all, just original 4's).
 * calculate_span often computes wrong bounds (train 1: start=0, end=23? leading to full-width overplacements; train 2: narrow span misses right extensions); conditions like place_left_up/down use wrong thresholds (e.g., <= maroon_width +1 too loose, causing phantom lefts).
 * find_left_start_end and find_right_end_y are helpful but underused—e.g., left_start_y=100 (no left object) should skip left up, but code places it anyway in some cases; right_end_y <=13 for full bottom not triggering correctly.
 * pos_list and sorted_pos for horizontals/down are conceptually good for multi-object connects but fail on gap checking (can_connect checks rows 0-y1 but places in y1-y2, and breaks early without full scan).
 * No removal of existing 8's—assumes clean shift, but if input has extras, they persist.
 * Train 1 mismatches: generated keeps left 1's in rows 4-11 cols 0-3 (correct) but misses extending 8's left in rows 7-8 cols 4-7 to connect to 1's; row 12 has 3's where expected 8's cols 4-5; bottom rows 14-16 overfill with 8's cols 0-3 instead of stopping at 4.
 * Train 2 mismatches: generated places 8's in wrong left positions (rows 0-4 cols 1-2 instead of cols 4-5); row 2 has fragmented 8's cols 13-17/19 instead of full cols 11-20; down missing entirely (rows 11-13 all 1's/bg where expected 8's cols 4-5/14-15/19?); bottom 4's unchanged but no 8's added.
 * Train 3 mismatches: generated misses left extensions (rows 0-3 cols 0-3 should be 8's over 7's? but expected cols 3-4 8's); rows 4-6 cols 0-7 all 7's unchanged instead of 8's cols 0-11; row 11 overconnects cols 4-23 with 8's but expected partial; bottom row 14 has 8's cols 3-23 but expected cols 0-23 except gaps.
 * Function calculate_span is broken in end_span logic (sets to width-1 on no right non-bg, causing full-width spans incorrectly); find_right_end_y returns -1 if no right objects, but code uses <=13 which may false-positive.
 * The down_connect_pos appending right without condition leads to unintended full spans; bottom_y2 = min(18, 14 + maroon_height -1) is good but start_full/end_full logic fails when down_pos empty (falls back to maroon, missing extensions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overplaces 8's extensively (e.g., rows 7-13 cols 3-20 all 8's, row 14 full 8's cols 3-23, rows 15-16 full 8's) while leaving original 9's and 1's fragmented without proper connections—e.g., no upward risers above the maroon in rows 0-3 cols 8-10/20, and bottom row 17-18 has partial 8's cols 0-2/16-23 mixing with 4's/9's instead of a clean full base; this suggests span calc went full-width incorrectly, and left/right conditionals failed to limit to maroon-adjacent objects (e.g., the left 9's block and right 3's aren't connected properly with shorts/verticals). It mismatches training patterns by not preserving object shapes (e.g., 9's in rows 4-6 cols 0-7/11-19 overwritten partially) and lacks gap-aware connects (e.g., no clear horizontal in row 6 cols 10-19). To handle test, need tighter span (only cover maroon + immediate neighbors), stricter left/right y-extent checks (e.g., distance thresholds based on actual object heights), and bg-only overwrites to avoid smashing 9's/1's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based structure (likely a building or platform) where the goal is to identify key colored components (e.g., supports, floors, and special elements like maroon blobs) and fill in background areas with a structural color (8, appearing as maroon) to complete supports and horizontal floors, while shifting the grid upward to simulate a "build" or "completion" effect. The output modifies the input grid by replacing background pixels with 8 in specific vertical and horizontal regions based on component positions, ensuring structural integrity without overwriting non-background elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid has 30 rows (0-29), but processing focuses on rows 6-23 for analysis; the shift_up function copies rows 6-23 to output rows 0-17 and row 23 to row 18, effectively cropping out top rows (0-5) and bottom row (24-29?) to create a 19-row output, which may simulate removing a "ground" or "sky" layer.
 * Background color (C) is the most common non-zero, non-5 color in rows 6-23, excluding 5 (possibly a special "void" or "edge" color); fills only replace C with 8, preserving other colors like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9.
 * Components are rectangular blobs of the same color, size >=4, found via flood-fill-like expansion (horizontal then vertical), excluding C, 0, and 5; they represent structural elements like platforms, walls, or objects.
 * Supports are vertical fills (full height or partial) at specific columns: left starts after the right edge of the leftmost non-8 component; middle uses the maroon (8) component's column range; right starts 2 columns left of the rightmost upper non-8 component (above bottom component).
 * Floors are horizontal fills with 8: for an upper "floor1" at the shifted maroon height (small_minr-6 to small_maxr-6), spanning left to right supports; if "far" (floor1 max row +2 < base row), add a base horizontal at (bottom_minr-6)-2 spanning from bottom component's left to grid right.
 * Subtleties: Maroon (8) components are treated specially (e.g., as middle support or "small" element), but input may already have 8s that shouldn't be overwritten; right support is often partial (only up to floor1 height, not full); "is_far" logic detects multi-level structures; bottom component is the lowest non-8; no diagonal or non-rectangular shapes—assumes axis-aligned rectangles; 5 may be ignored as non-fillable; output must match exactly, including preserving non-C areas.
 * Edge cases: No non-maroon components defaults left support to col 4; no upper components defaults right to col 20; base horizontal only from bottom_start if far; horizontal fills are 1-2 rows thick, but code varies (e.g., floor1_min to floor1_max vs single row).
 * All fills are conditional on C only, so over-filling (e.g., replacing non-C) or under-filling (missing partial supports) breaks outputs; grid width is 24 columns consistently.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of support/floor logic, especially partial fills and multi-level detection.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8 fills in left/middle areas (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 0-3 filled with 8 instead of preserving 3; row 7-8 full 8 horizontal too wide, overwriting 3s; bottom rows 16-18 have 8s in cols 17-18 where expected 3s; row 11-12 have 8s in cols 18-19 where expected 3s/4s). Missed preserving background 3 in non-support areas; overfilled right support below floor1; horizontal floor1 at single row instead of range; is_far logic failed, no base horizontal added correctly.
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled 8s in upper areas (e.g., row 2 cols 6-17 all 8, but expected partial with 1s; row 4 cols 16-17=3 but filled 8? Wait, input has 3 there?); row 9-10 full 8 in cols 6-17 overwriting 1s; bottom rows 16-18 have 8 in col 5 and cols 17-18 where expected 1s; missed narrowing middle support to avoid overwriting 6s/3s; right support too wide/full height; horizontal in row 14-15 too narrow, missing full span.
 * Train 3: Generated partial 8 fills incorrectly (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 18-19=8 but expected 7/8 mix; row 4 cols 0-7=7 but expected 8 full; row 12 full 8 horizontal but expected partial; row 14 cols 20-21=6 but filled 8?; row 16-18 cols 0-2=2 preserved but cols 3-5=8 where expected 7). Underfilled upper supports (e.g., row 4-6 left/middle not fully 8); overfilled right in lower areas; base horizontal in row 16-18 cols 8-21=4 preserved but supports wrong; get_bottom_comp likely buggy (max min_r picks wrong "bottom").
 * Overall: Component detection works (finds blobs), but positioning (e.g., right_start -2) and fill ranges (partial right, is_far for base) fail consistently; shift_up preserves structure but fills ignore levels; no handling for pre-existing 8s or color-specific rules (e.g., 6/4 as special); unhelpful: get_right_support_start filters upper but defaults high (20), causing wide overfills; fill functions are safe but applied wrongly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills with 8 in central columns (e.g., cols 8-19 rows 3-16 mostly 8, creating a wide "pillar" that overwrites what should be preserved 9s/1s for structure), while leaving top rows 0-2 all 2s (correct preservation?) but bottom row 18 has 4s starting col 7 (partial, but spans to col 16 with 9s/8s mismatched). Expected likely narrower supports (e.g., left at col 0-3 for 1s? No, test input has 2s top, 9s middle, 1s lower left, 4s bottom partial), with vertical 8s only at edges/middle based on components (e.g., maroon? None visible, so defaults fail); horizontals missing for floors (e.g., no 8 row at 1s height or base); right support seems partial but too low (row 13-16 cols 20-23=8/9 mix wrong); is_far probably misdetected, no base fill; overall, looks like generic overfill without adapting to test's tall 9/1 stack and right-edge 3s—suggests program assumes maroon presence and fixed widths, breaking on test's layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following interactions and connections between elements are obvious and consistent across **every** train example (Train 1, 2, and 3). Only elements with clear, direct relationships (e.g., transformations preserving specific properties like color or pixels, or causal overlaps like containment) are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the Orange top bar, which appears consistently but has no observable transformation or effect on other components) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided. Interactions that vary (e.g., exact bbox shifts or hole counts) are noted as such, and unexplainable transformations are flagged as unknown.

1. **Large background color → Multiple output fill components (color replication)**  
   - The color of the large background block in input (Green in Train 1, Blue in Train 2, Dark Red in Train 3) directly determines the color of multiple large fill blocks in output.  
   - Preserved: Color exactly matches; these output blocks overlap or adjoin to create layered depth (e.g., filling panels or enclosures).  
   - Effect: Background color "spreads" to 4+ output components, adjusting bbox for structure but preserving the input color as the dominant fill.  
   - Consistent holes: Input background has 1-2 holes; output fills have 0 holes (no hole propagation observed).  
   - Pixels: Input background pixels (290-366) distribute across output fills (total output pixels from these ~200-250, partial sum; exact distribution unknown).

2. **Small central Maroon line → Large enclosing Maroon frame (position and scale transformation)**  
   - The small vertical Maroon line in input (bbox central x ~8-12, mid-height y ~13-18, pixels=4-9, holes=0) transforms into a large horizontal-spanning Maroon frame in output (bbox wide x ~0-23, top-to-mid y ~0-15, pixels=116-138).  
   - Preserved: Color (Maroon); transformation from thin vertical to wide enclosing structure (e.g., outline or bracket-like).  
   - Effect: Input position (central) expands to enclose other output components; interacts with background fills by overlapping edges for depth.  
   - Varying: Holes (input always 0, output 0-2; no consistent hole effect); exact bbox x-start (0 or 4).  
   - Pixels: Increases ~15-30x, indicating scale-up (unknown how pixels are added, possibly from background overlap).

3. **Left tall thin block → Left-side output panel (position shift and preservation)**  
   - The tall thin block on the left in input (color varies: Blue/Red/Red; bbox left x ~0-3, mid-height y ~9-17 or 11-17, pixels=28-36, holes=0) transforms into a similar left-side tall thin panel in output (same color, bbox left x ~0-3, upper y ~3-11 or 5-11 or 7-18, same pixels).  
   - Preserved: Color, pixels (exact match), holes=0, approximate shape (tall thin vertical).  
   - Effect: Position y shifts upward (reduced by ~4-10 units); interacts with Maroon frame by adjoining left edge and with background fills by partial overlap for depth.  
   - Consistent: Always left-aligned; no x-shift observed.

4. **Right tall block → Right-side output panel (position shift and preservation)**  
   - The tall block on the right in input (color varies: Yellow/Green/Pink; bbox right x ~16-23, mid-height y ~6-19, pixels=24-44, holes=0) transforms into a similar right-side tall panel in output (same color, bbox right x ~16-23 or 18-21, upper y ~3-13 or 5-10, same pixels).  
   - Preserved: Color, pixels (exact match), holes=0, approximate shape (tall vertical or block).  
   - Effect: Position y shifts upward (reduced by ~4-8 units); sometimes minor x-adjustment leftward; interacts with Maroon frame by adjoining right edge and with background fills by partial overlap.  
   - Consistent: Always right-aligned post-transformation.

5. **Bottom horizontal block → Upper-bottom output bar (position shift and preservation)**  
   - The horizontal block at bottom in input (color varies: Red/Yellow/Yellow; bbox central x ~4-21, bottom y ~22-24 or 23-24, pixels=24-42, holes=0) transforms into a similar central horizontal bar in output (same color, bbox central x ~4-21 or 5-12 or 8-21, mid-height y ~16-18, same pixels).  
   - Preserved: Color, pixels (exact match), holes=0, shape (wide horizontal).  
   - Effect: Position y shifts upward significantly (reduced by ~4-6 units); interacts with background fills by sitting atop them and with Maroon frame by being enclosed below it.  
   - Consistent: Always central x-alignment; no width change.

6. **Mid horizontal block (when present) → Top horizontal output bar (position shift and preservation)**  
   - The horizontal block mid-field in input (present in Train 2 and 3, not in Train 1; color Pink/Green, bbox central x ~8-20, mid y ~6-9, pixels=10-40, holes=0) transforms into a central top horizontal bar in output (same color, bbox central x ~8-17 or 13-17, top y ~0-3 or 0-1, same pixels).  
   - Preserved: Color, pixels (exact match), holes=0, shape (wide horizontal).  
   - Effect: Position shifts upward to top (y reduced to ~0-3); interacts with Maroon frame by adjoining top edge and with background fills by overlay if no mid input (in Train 1, top uses background color instead).  
   - Consistent: Only when present; otherwise, top uses background color (interaction with absence noted).

### Unknown or Inconsistent Interactions
- **Top small vertical colored bars (4x, pixels=4 each)**: Always present in input Orange bbox (colors and x-positions vary: e.g., x~1-22), but no consistent transformation to output components. Colors sometimes match output panels (e.g., left small color to left panel in Train 1 and 2), but not in every case (e.g., no match in Train 3 right). Pixels do not preserve (output tops have pixels=10-42). Positions may divide top space, but no consistent effect on output divisions or colors observed. Flagged as unknown interaction.
- **Holes in large background**: Vary (1-2 in input), but no consistent effect on output holes (Maroon frame holes 0-2, no direct mapping).
- **Orange top bar (holes=4)**: Consistent in input, but no observed interaction or transformation to output (discarded; no color or hole propagation).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-01 23:20:20] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [g[r][c] for r in range(6, 25) for c in range(24) if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != 5]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    row = g[1]
    b1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)

    b4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return b1, b2, b3, b4

def has_merge(b2: int, b3: int) -> bool:
    return b2 == 6 or b3 == 6

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 23:21:07] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle simulating the flow or spread of a special element (represented by 8, possibly liquid or filler) across a background in a 19x24 subgrid (rows 6-24 of input), where it expands into adjacent background cells based on rules involving colored bars, pillars (vertical lines of 8), and merging conditions, while preserving other colored objects and filling voids (0 or 5) with background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the most common non-zero, non-5 color in the lower subgrid (rows 6-24), excluding 8; this fills all 0 and 5 cells initially, but 8 can overwrite bg cells during spreading.
 * Four horizontal bars (b1-b4) are extracted from row 1 at specific column ranges (1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22); their colors (non-zero) influence behavior—e.g., b2 or b3 == 6 triggers "merge" mode for bidirectional spreading.
 * Spreading of 8 occurs only in rows that originally contain 8; it expands leftward (or both directions in merge mode) into contiguous bg cells adjacent to 8 blocks, but does not cross non-bg cells or other colors.
 * Pillars are vertical columns containing any 8 in the input subgrid; in merge mode, these are pre-filled with 8 in every output row where the cell is bg, creating persistent vertical spread paths.
 * Subtleties: Spreading is per-row and only activates if the row has 8 initially; pillars add 8 to bg cells in those columns before spreading, but only in merge mode; repeated identical rows in output suggest no change or full fill; 8 blocks are treated as contiguous segments for expansion, but do not merge across non-bg gaps.
 * Easy to miss: get_background excludes 8 and 5 correctly, but flat list must avoid empty cases; bar extraction takes first non-zero in each segment; spreading loops must handle multiple 8 segments per row without overlapping incorrectly; output preserves original non-bg, non-8 colors exactly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Merge mode (b2/b3==6) should enable bidirectional spread and pillar pre-filling, but non-merge uses only leftward spread without pillars; pillars are global (from all input rows) but applied row-by-row; no vertical spreading—everything is horizontal per row; test inputs may have unique bar configs or pillar positions requiring exact column tracking.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [g[r][c] for r in range(6, 25) for c in range(24) if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != 5]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode color, excluding voids and 8; useful for initial fill.)

```python
def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    row = g[1]
    b1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)
    b2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    b3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    b4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return b1, b2, b3, b4
```
(This extracts bar colors from fixed positions in row 1; essential for determining merge/spread mode.)

```python
def has_merge(b2: int, b3: int) -> bool:
    return b2 == 6 or b3 == 6
```
(Simple but key for toggling bidirectional spread and pillar usage.)

```python
def spread_left(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] == bg:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            i = end + 1
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(Handles leftward expansion from 8 blocks into bg; useful for non-merge cases, but note it skips rightward.)

```python
def spread_both(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] == bg:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] == bg:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(Extends leftward + rightward; critical for merge mode, handles contiguous bg on both sides.)

```python
def get_pillar_cols(g: List[List[int]]) -> list:
    cols = set()
    for r in range(6, 25):
        for c in range(24):
            if g[r][c] == 8:
                cols.add(c)
    return list(cols)
```
(Identifies all columns with any 8 for pre-filling in merge mode; helpful but only applied conditionally.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt processes the subgrid correctly (rows 6-24 into 19 output rows) and applies bg fill to 0/5, but all three training examples fail due to incorrect spreading and pillar handling.
 * Train 1 (likely non-merge): Generated spreads 8 leftward in some rows but fails to place additional 8s in columns 16-17 (expected 8,8 there in top rows and some middle); also misses leftward fill in row 9-10 (expected 8,8 in cols 4-5) and full horizontal 8 spread in row 14-15 (generated has gaps at cols 6-15,17-23); bottom rows match expected 2s and 3s.
 * Train 2 (merge mode, b3=6?): Generated incorrectly places initial 8s only in cols 8-9 without pillars, leading to no spread into cols 4-5 or 14-21; row 2 has no rightward 8s in cols 14-21 (expected full 8,8,1... but wait, expected has 8s in 4-5 and 8-9, then 14-21); row 14 has no 8s in cols 8-15,17-23 (expected full 8s there); preserves 6s and 4s correctly but misses bidirectional expansion.
 * Train 3 (merge mode?): Generated pre-fills pillars (cols 12-13?) but spreads incorrectly—e.g., row 0-2 have 3s in cols 8-17 instead of expected 3s only in 8-17 with 8s in 0-3,20-23? Wait, expected has 8s in 3-4 and 19-20; row 4 has 7s in cols 8-11 instead of full 8s; row 11-12 have 8s only in 3-15? but expected full 8s 3-21; row 14 has 7s in 20-23 instead of 6s? No, expected has 6s preserved but 8s around; overall, pillar pre-fill happens but spreading doesn't connect properly, and some original colors like 6s are overwritten incorrectly.
 * What worked: Bg detection and fill seem accurate (e.g., 3s in Train 1, 1s in Train 2); bar extraction and merge detection likely correct (activates both-spread in Trains 2/3); per-row 8 presence check prevents unwanted spreading; preserves non-bg elements like 1s,2s,4s,6s.
 * What didn't: Pillar pre-fill in merge mode is applied to all rows but only where bg, yet doesn't lead to correct connections (e.g., no vertical propagation, but horizontal spread from them fails); spreading functions expand correctly for isolated 8s but miss multi-segment or pillar-induced fills; in non-merge, no pillars means isolated left-spreads only; loop in spread_both sets i=j after right spread, which skips if no right bg but may miss multiple segments; get_pillar_cols collects all 8-cols but in Train 1 (non-merge) it's unused, causing misses.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, but the main program integration (applying pillars before spread, conditional spread) is buggy; e.g., pillars added after bg fill but before spread, yet in Train 1 expected has 8s in non-pillar cols.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows excessive 2s and 9s in early rows with 8s only in row 7 (cols 3-10?), but no clear spreading pattern—e.g., row 0-2 are all 2s except right 3s, row 3-5 all 9s with right 3s, row 6 has 1s then 9s, row 7 has 1s,8s,9s, but expected likely involves bg=3 or 9?, bars determining merge (possibly b4=3 irrelevant, check b2/b3), pillars from input 8s (maybe col 3?), and spreading 8s bidirectionally if merge, filling into bg but preserving 1s/4s; instead, it seems to ignore pillars entirely (no vertical 8s persisting), spreads minimally left-only in row 7 without connecting to row 6's potential, and row 17-18 have 4s in cols 7-16 but no 8 integration, suggesting broken pillar or merge detection for this input's bar colors (possibly no merge, but still misses left-spreads); overall, lacks the connected 8 fills seen in expected trains, like full rows or extended segments.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 23:21:23] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on direct comparison across all three train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent in **every** example. These are limited to properties (e.g., position, color, holes, bbox, pixels) that reliably link input elements to output elements without variation or ambiguity. Only elements with clear, direct mappings are included; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the top orange frame, which is always present in input but entirely absent in output with no traceable effect) are excluded. No high-level interpretations or puzzle solutions are provided. Unknown mappings (e.g., exact rules for fragmentation or bbox adjustments) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Lower Rectangular Elements (Non-Background, Non-Maroon) – Position to Position/Color/Holes/Bbox/Pixels Preservation via Translation**
   - **Description**: Specific rectangular elements in the input (below y≈6, excluding the large background and small Maroon) consistently undergo a uniform vertical translation in the output: every y-coordinate (min and max in bbox) is decreased by exactly 6 units. All other properties (color, holes, bbox width/height dimensions, pixel count) are preserved exactly. These elements do not interact with other components during this transformation; it is isolated to their own properties.
   - **Affected Components**: Thin-to-wide rectangles of various colors (e.g., Blue, Pink, Green, Yellow, Red), always with holes=0 and pixels matching row-like fills (e.g., 24–44). They appear in the input's mid-to-lower area (y≥6, often starting at y=6–13) and span widths of 2–14 units.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Blue ([0,9,3,17], holes=0, pixels=36) → Blue ([0,3,3,11], holes=0, pixels=36); Yellow ([18,10,21,16], holes=0, pixels=28) → Yellow ([18,4,21,10], holes=0, pixels=28); Red ([4,22,14,24], holes=0, pixels=33) → Red ([4,16,14,18], holes=0, pixels=33).
     - Train 2: Pink ([13,6,17,7], holes=0, pixels=10) → Pink ([13,0,17,1], holes=0, pixels=10); Green ([16,11,19,16], holes=0, pixels=24) → Green ([16,5,19,10], holes=0, pixels=24); Red ([0,11,3,17], holes=0, pixels=28) → Red ([0,5,3,11], holes=0, pixels=28); Yellow ([5,22,12,24], holes=0, pixels=24) → Yellow ([5,16,12,18], holes=0, pixels=24).
     - Train 3: Green ([8,6,17,9], holes=0, pixels=40) → Green ([8,0,17,3], holes=0, pixels=40); Pink ([20,9,23,19], holes=0, pixels=44) → Pink ([20,3,23,13], holes=0, pixels=44); Red ([0,13,2,24], holes=0, pixels=36) → Red ([0,7,2,18], holes=0, pixels=36); Yellow ([8,22,21,24], holes=0, pixels=42) → Yellow ([8,16,21,18], holes=0, pixels=42).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input y-position (min/max) → output y-position (min/max, shifted -6); color → color (unchanged); holes=0 → holes=0 (unchanged); bbox width/height → bbox width/height (unchanged); pixels → pixels (unchanged).
   - **Notes**: This applies to 3–4 such elements per input, always preserving shape integrity. No horizontal (x) changes or interactions with other elements (e.g., no overlap effects or color blending observed). In the test input, analogous elements (Red [0,6,20,8], Green [21,6,23,18], Blue [0,12,2,21], Yellow [7,23,15,25]) match this profile and would follow the same translation if processed.

#### 2. **Small Maroon Element – Size/Position to Large Maroon Frame (Partial Mapping, Details Unknown)**
   - **Description**: A single small Maroon element in every input (central-lower position) consistently maps to a single large Maroon element in every output, expanding to cover a broad top-mid frame area (y=0 to ≈15, x spanning most of width). Pixels increase significantly (from ~4–9 to ~116–138), and bbox expands in all directions. However, exact rules for bbox adjustments, hole count, and pixel increase are unknown (variable and not directly derivable from input properties).
   - **Affected Components**: Input: Small Maroon (holes=0, pixels=4–9, bbox ≈[8–12,13–17,9–13,14–18], narrow width 1–2, height 1–2). Output: Large Maroon (bbox ≈[0–4,0,19–23,15], width 15–19, height 15; holes=0–2; pixels=116–138).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input ([8,13,9,14], holes=0, pixels=4) → Output ([4,0,23,15], holes=1, pixels=116).
     - Train 2: Input ([8,14,9,15], holes=0, pixels=4) → Output ([4,0,23,15], holes=0, pixels=124).
     - Train 3: Input ([12,17,13,18], holes=0, pixels=4) → Output ([0,0,19,15], holes=2, pixels=138).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input color (Maroon) → output color (Maroon, unchanged); input presence (always 1 small instance) → output presence (always 1 large instance); input position (central x≈8–12, lower y≈13–17) → output position (top-mid frame, x-start ≈0–4, x-end ≈19–23 influenced by input x? – unknown exact mapping); input holes=0 → output holes (variable 0–2, no direct link); input pixels (~4) → output pixels (~120, scaled up but unknown rule); input bbox (small) → output bbox (expanded, height fixed to 15 but width variable).
   - **Notes**: This is the only consistent color-to-color expansion observed. No interactions with other elements (e.g., no merging with shifted rects). In the test input, the Maroon ([8,13,10,15], holes=0, pixels=9) matches the input profile (slightly wider bbox but same scale). Hole variability and exact bbox/pixel scaling are unknown and inconsistent.

#### 3. **Background Element – Color to Multiple Output Segments (Fragmentation, Positions Unknown)**
   - **Description**: The large background element in every input (holes=2, lower-area coverage, color varies) consistently determines the color of multiple smaller segments in every output (same color, scattered as thin-to-wide rects forming apparent paths). Total output pixels for these segments are reduced (not preserved), and they are fragmented into 4–9 pieces. Exact fragmentation rules (e.g., count, positions, sizes, bbox derivation) are unknown.
   - **Affected Components**: Input: Large background (holes=2, bbox ≈[0,6–9,23,24–29], pixels=290–408, color=Green/Blue/Dark Red/Light Blue). Output: 4–9 segments of matching color (holes=0, varied bbox like [0–23,0–18] spans, pixels=3–96 each, total ~150–250).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input Green (holes=2, pixels=355) → Output 6 Green segments (total pixels=243, e.g., [0,0,7,6] pixels=40).
     - Train 2: Input Blue (holes=2, pixels=366) → Output 7 Blue segments (total pixels=246, e.g., [0,0,3,4] pixels=20).
     - Train 3: Input Dark Red (holes=1, pixels=290; note: holes=1 but pattern holds for color) → Output 9 Dark Red segments (total pixels=156, e.g., [0,0,2,3] pixels=12).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input color (background) → output color (multiple segments, unchanged); input holes=2 (or 1) → output holes=0 (all segments, no preservation); input pixels (~300–400) → output pixels (reduced total ~150–250, unknown scaling); input bbox (lower full-width) → output bbox (scattered, often top-mid y=0–18, full-ish x=0–23 but fragmented – positions unknown).
   - **Notes**: These output segments do not interact directly with shifted rects or Maroon frame in a consistent way (e.g., no fixed overlaps or color changes). No shape preservation (input is broad with holes; outputs are rects without holes). In the test input, Light Blue background (holes=2, pixels=408) matches the profile, implying output segments would be Light Blue.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., top small elements [y=1–4, pixels=4] have no direct mappings to output components across all examples; their positions/colors do not reliably affect any specific output property like color or bbox). Background changes (green grid-like to blue water-like) are descriptive but not tied to specific element interactions.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 23:23:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 24-column grid (likely 19 rows shown in outputs) where colored bars (extracted from the second row of the input grid) define protected zones, and sequences of 8's (representing a spreading "ink" or "flood" element) expand horizontally within their rows only under a specific merge condition (if bar 2 or 3 is color 6), stopping at protected colors or edges, while leaving other numbers (like 1,2,3,4, etc.) intact unless overwritten by the spread.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid g is a List[List[int]] with at least 25 rows (indices 0-24), but the output focuses on rows 6-24 (19 rows), copying them initially and modifying only where 8's are present.
 * Bar colors (1-4) are extracted from specific segments of row 1 (indices 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22), taking the first non-zero value in each; these bars act as blockers for spreading, along with color 5 (a universal protector, possibly a special barrier).
 * Spreading only activates if has_merge is true (bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6), indicating a "merge" event that allows 8's to propagate; without this, the grid is returned unchanged.
 * When spreading in a row with 8's: identify contiguous sequences of 8's, then expand left from the start and right from the end, overwriting non-protected cells (anything not in {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5}) until hitting a protected cell or edge; this must be done per row independently, and only affects rows containing at least one 8.
 * Subtlety: Spreading does not cross protected cells, even if they are not bars (e.g., stops at existing 1's or other numbers if they match protected set); it also doesn't spread vertically—only horizontal per row.
 * Easy to miss: The protected set is dynamic per puzzle (based on bars), and 0's in row 1 are ignored for bar extraction; spreading overwrites blanks or other fillable cells but preserves protected ones; in some cases, 8's appear to "connect" across gaps only if unprotected.
 * Other considerations: Grids have repeating rows (e.g., three identical rows of bars or fillers), suggesting vertical stacking or patterns; numbers like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 represent distinct colors/objects that shouldn't be altered unless spread into; the puzzle may involve "ink" filling regions bounded by bars, but only triggers on merge.
 * From examples: Spreading creates "blobs" of 8's that respect bar boundaries (e.g., in ex1, 8's fill between bars but stop at 1's/4's if protected); non-merge cases might do nothing; test input has 9's as a new color, possibly a bar or filler, and partial 8's that should spread if merge applies.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bar_colors(g):
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next(c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0)
    bar2 = next(c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0)
    bar3 = next(c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0)
    bar4 = next(c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts bar colors correctly from fixed positions in row 1, ignoring 0's; useful for defining protectors.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2, bar3):
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(This checks the merge condition accurately; essential to gate the spreading logic, as non-merge outputs should be unchanged.)

(The main program structure—copying rows 6:25, checking merge, defining protected set, and iterating rows for spreading—is a good skeleton, but the spreading implementation is flawed as detailed below. No types like classes are used, but a protected set is helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and extracts bar colors via get_bar_colors, which matches the positional logic seen in examples (e.g., bars at columns 1-4,7-10,etc., with non-zero first value).
 * has_merge works as a trigger, preventing changes in non-merge cases (though all examples seem to be merge cases).
 * The protected set {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5} is a good idea, capturing blockers like bars and a special 5.
 * However, spreading logic is broken: it over-spreads 8's across entire rows or sections, ignoring actual protected cells in the row (e.g., in train1, it fills huge swaths with 8's and even changes non-8 areas to 3's incorrectly, instead of stopping at existing 1's/4's; expected has isolated 8 pairs like positions 8-9 and 16-17).
 * In train1: Generated has full rows of 3's at top and massive 8 blocks in rows 7-8, but expected has targeted 8's (e.g., rows 0-2: 8's only at cols 8-9,16-17; row 9: 8's at 4-5,8-9 but stops before protected 3's/4's); difference is over-filling and wrong base colors (3's where 8's shouldn't go).
 * In train2: Generated spreads 8's too far in rows 8-9 (full blocks), but expected has more precise 8's (e.g., row 0: 8's at 4-5,8-9; row 2: wide 8's from col 13-21 but starting from existing); also fails to spread into some gaps (e.g., row 4 has no 8's in generated but expected has them); introduces wrong 1's in bar areas.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly fills with 7's in early rows and over-spreads 8's in row 11-12, but expected has 8's integrated with 7's as blockers (e.g., row 0: 8's at 3-4,18-19; row 4: full 8's but stopping at 7's); misses connecting 8's across minor gaps while respecting 7/6 bars.
 * Overall: Attempt demonstrates understanding of bars, merge, and horizontal spreading concept, but fails on precise boundary detection (spreads past existing protected numbers like 1/3/4/6/7 if they match set but doesn't check per-cell in row); the while loops for left/right spread use row[] for checks but new_row for writes, causing overwrite issues or skipping; no handling for multiple 8 sequences per row properly.
 * get_bar_colors and has_merge are helpful and correct—keep them; the spreading loop is unhelpful/broken (over-aggressive, doesn't preserve non-8 non-protected cells correctly, and mutates incorrectly)—avoid reusing as-is.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It mostly copies the input with minimal changes (e.g., rows 0-2 full of 2's unchanged; rows 3-6 full 9's; only partial 8's in row 7 at cols 8-10, but no spreading despite likely merge), resulting in isolated 8's and untouched 9's/4's, which mismatches the pattern of controlled 8 expansion seen in training expecteds (e.g., should spread 8's left/right from row 7's position 8-10 into adjacent 9's if unprotected, potentially filling between bars like cols 4-11 or similar, stopping at 1's or extracted bars; instead, it leaves most 9's intact and doesn't propagate, suggesting the merge check passed but spreading failed to activate/execute properly).
 * Differences: No wide 8 blobs as in training expecteds (e.g., expected likely has 8's expanding in rows 7+ to connect or fill regions bounded by 1's/9's/3's, especially row 17-18 where 4's are, possibly overwriting some 9's but not 1's/3's); the output feels like a near-copy with buggy partial 8 insert, missing the "flood" effect; 9's seem treated as non-protected but not filled, indicating the spread logic doesn't target them correctly.
 * To handle test: Ensure spreading checks every row with 8's (row 7 here), uses the correct protected set (bars likely 2/9/?/3 or similar from row 1, plus 5), and propagates only horizontally without altering non-8 rows; mentally, if bar2 or 3 is 6, 8's in row 7 should spread left to col 4 (stop at 1's?) and right to col 11 (stop at 9's if protected), creating a blob like [1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,...].

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the task is to overlay or insert a special color (8) to highlight or connect specific linear or banded patterns, likely representing outlines, borders, or extensions of existing colored regions across horizontal bands of similar rows. The goal is to transform the input grid by replacing background or gap cells with 8's in precise positions to form paired or extended lines, while preserving other colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of horizontal "bands" of identical or near-identical rows, and processing must group these bands to identify patterns like runs of non-background colors.
 * 8's are placed specifically to form short pairs (e.g., two consecutive 8's) or extend existing lines, often adjacent to non-background runs of width <=4, but only in certain directions (e.g., right of left-side runs or left of right-side runs), and sometimes filling full horizontal segments in stacked bands.
 * Background color (most common cell value) must be ignored when detecting runs; runs are sequences of the same non-background color.
 * Subtlety: 8's often appear in positions that "bridge" or outline shapes across bands, such as vertical alignments (e.g., columns 8-9 and 16-17 in train 1), but not always full rows—e.g., in train 1 row 9, 8's are interrupted by 3's in specific columns.
 * Another subtlety: In stacked bands, 8's can propagate vertically or fill entire row segments if aligned (e.g., full 8 rows in train 1 rows 7-8), but only where patterns match across bands; isolated bands don't get full fills.
 * Placement rules seem tied to grid width (e.g., references to column 12 suggest a 24-column grid midpoint), with left-side runs (start <12) extending right, and right-side runs extending left, but only if width conditions are met and color != background.
 * Easy to miss: Existing 8's in input should be preserved or extended, but new 8's only replace background; overfilling (e.g., replacing non-background with 8's) breaks the output.
 * Vertical alignment is key—8's must match column positions across multiple rows in a band for consistency (e.g., train 2 has 8 pairs in columns 4-5, 8-9, 14-15).
 * Bands may have interruptions (e.g., train 1 row 9 has 8's with 3's in between), so run detection must handle non-uniform rows within a "band" of mostly similar rows.
 * No vertical processing in current code—puzzle likely requires checking alignments across bands, not just within rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty or short grids return empty; top 6 rows seem ignored (header?); color 8 has special handling (e.g., width >=2 triggers pairs).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for ignoring it in run detection.)

```python
def get_bands(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    bands = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        j = i
        while j < n and grid[j] == grid[i]:
            j += 1
        pattern = grid[i]
        runs = []
        k = 0
        m = len(pattern)
        while k < m:
            if pattern[k] == get_background(grid):
                k += 1
                continue
            color = pattern[k]
            start = k
            while k < m and pattern[k] == color:
                k += 1
            end = k - 1
            width = end - start + 1
            runs.append((start, end, color, width))
        bands.append((i, j - i, runs))
        i = j
    return bands
```
(This groups identical rows into bands and extracts non-background runs with positions and widths, useful for identifying candidate line positions; however, it assumes perfectly identical rows in bands, which may not hold if rows have minor variations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (3 in train 1, 1 in train 2, 7 in train 3) and groups rows into bands, which works for detecting horizontal patterns.
 * Run extraction in get_bands skips background and captures widths/colors, helpful for spotting short runs (<=4) that might need extension.
 * find_line_pairs attempts to detect positions for 8 pairs based on color 8 (width>=2) or short non-bg runs, adding adjacent positions (e.g., right of left runs), which partially aligns with pair placements but fails to propagate vertically or fill aligned segments.
 * In program, it copies the grid and only replaces bg with 8's in rows with detected pairs, using min/max columns to fill segments— this overfills horizontally (e.g., full 8's from col 4-20 in train 1 row 7) instead of precise pairs.
 * Train 1 generated: Overfilled rows 7-8 and 9 with continuous 8's in cols 4-17, ignoring interruptions (expected has pairs at 8-9,16-17 with 3's elsewhere; also missed upper pairs and lower extensions like row 12-15).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Rows 0-2 all 3's (correct, no change), but rows 3-6 should have pairs starting at row 3, not just lower; row 9 has full 8's instead of interrupted (8,8,3,3,8,8,3,3); rows 12-15 missed entirely (expected 8 pairs); bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 2 generated: Filled cols 4-15 with 8's in rows 7-8 and 10, but expected has pairs at specific columns (4-5,8-9,14-15) across more rows (e.g., rows 0-1,3-4,5-8,9-10); missed vertical extensions in row 2 (full 8's cols 14-21); row 14 has full 8's cols 8-21 (wrong, expected pairs).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper rows 0-1 have no 8's (expected pairs); row 2 all 1's (expected long 8's); rows 11-12 missed pairs; bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 3 generated: Filled cols 3-19 with 8's in rows 11-12, but expected has more distributed pairs (e.g., cols 3-4,13-14 in upper rows); rows 4-7 all 7's (missed 8 extensions); row 16 has 8's only in detected band (wrong positions).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Rows 0-2 have 3's unchanged (expected pairs at 3-4,18-19); rows 4-6 all 7's (expected full 8's cols 0-7,19-20); row 6 has partial (expected more); rows 13-15 missed pairs and full 8's; function assumes exact row equality for bands, but train 3 row 6 differs slightly from above.
 * Overall, program ignores vertical alignment across bands, leading to no propagation (e.g., no 8's in upper bands of train 1); line_pairs only adds single adjacent cells, not pairs or fills.
 * find_line_pairs is broken/not helpful: It adds (start, start+1) for color 8 width>=2 (but start is run start, so wrong positions); for other runs, adds single cells adjacent but not pairs, and only if start<12 or end>11 (midpoint logic partial but incomplete); doesn't handle full fills or interruptions.
 * get_bands is mostly helpful but skips bg in runs correctly; however, doesn't handle near-identical bands (e.g., if rows differ by 1 cell).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills large horizontal segments with 8's (e.g., rows 7-9 cols 3-20 full 8's, row 13 cols 3-20 full 9's unchanged but should likely get pairs) instead of precise pairs or aligned extensions, similar to training errors.
 * In test, top rows 0-2 all 2's (likely correct, no change); rows 3-5 all 9's (correct); row 6 has 1's in cols 0-2 then 9's (partial, but expected probably 8 pairs around the 1's); rows 7-9 overfilled with 8's across most cols (expected pairs like cols 3-4, perhaps 12-13 based on pattern); rows 10-12 1's then 9's (missed 8's); rows 13-15 full 9's in cols 3+ (wrong, likely need pairs); rows 16-17 all 9's (correct?); rows 18-20 have 4's in cols 7-15 (unchanged, but may need 8 outlines); bottom all 9's (correct). It ignores vertical patterns (e.g., the left 1's in rows 6-12 suggest a vertical shape needing 8 borders on right).
 * No vertical propagation: The 1's on left in rows 6-12 align vertically, likely needing 8 pairs to the right (e.g., cols 3-4), but output only fills in row 7-9 band; bottom 4's band unchanged despite being a distinct run.
 * Overfilling bg with 8's in detected bands, but test has bg=9 (most common), so runs of 2/1/4 should trigger specific pair placements, not full rows; misses potential full 8 rows if aligned across bands (none here, but code doesn't check).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to generate a modified version of a subgrid (rows 6-24) by spreading a special "ink" or filler (value 8) from initial seeds or patterns, influenced by background color detection, vertical bars with specific colors (like 6 indicating merges), and rules for expanding 8's into adjacent background cells while preserving other structures like colored blocks or bars.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a background color (most common value across the entire input grid), which 8's can spread into horizontally in affected rows, but only adjacent to existing 8's or seeds; spreading does not overwrite non-background cells (e.g., colored blocks like 1's, 3's, 4's, or bars).
 * Vertical bars (likely in fixed columns like 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22 based on code attempts) have colors that trigger rules: a bar color of 6 in bar2 or bar3 indicates a "merge" mode, which seeds additional 8's in specific column pairs across all output rows where the background is present.
 * Initial seeds for 8's come from finding consecutive 8's (length >=2) in the input subgrid rows; during merge, seed two adjacent columns (e.g., start and start+1 of the first such pair found) with 8's in all rows if those positions are background.
 * Spreading of 8's is horizontal only, expanding left/right from clusters of 8's into background, but only applied to rows that originally contain at least one 8 in the input; this can create filled horizontal bands or connect sections.
 * Subtleties: Merges create vertical "pillars" of 8's that then spread horizontally in subsequent rows; not all rows spread equally—some expected outputs show partial spreading (e.g., only left or right sides), and 8's can form large connected blobs vertically/horizontally but respect block boundaries. Bars and blocks (e.g., sequences of same color like 1's or 4's) must not be overwritten. In non-merge cases, spreading might be minimal or absent. Easy to miss: seed positions are column-based across all rows, but spreading is per-row; background detection uses the whole grid, including non-subgrid rows. Also, 8's in input might already be present, and spreading should chain (e.g., fill gaps between multiple 8 clusters in a row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where initial pair is not found (return None, no seeding); spreading must skip over non-background (e.g., don't spread into a 4-block); vertical alignment of 8's from seeding must propagate spreading in lower rows; in merge, seeding happens before spreading, and only in background positions.

```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The main `program` function integrates the above but is broken: it seeds only if merge and pair found, but applies seeding by setting to 8 only if background (good), yet spreads only on rows with original 8's (misses seeded rows); also, out = copy of subgrid before seeding, so seeding adds 8's but spreading check uses original g, leading to incomplete propagation. Not helpful as-is—needs fixing for vertical seeding to trigger spreading in all rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core logic for seeding and spreading is incomplete or misapplied.
 * In Training 1 (background likely 3): Generated correctly copied subgrid and detected bars/background, and spread some 8's in rows with original 8's (e.g., positions 8-9 filled consistently), but failed to seed additional 8's in columns 16-17 for top rows (expected has 8,8 there, generated has 3,3); also missed left-spreading in rows like index 9-11 (generated [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,8,8,...]) and full horizontal 8-band in rows 14-15 (generated partial 8,8 at 8-9, expected full 8's from 4-23). In bottom rows 16-18, no spreading issues as no 8's. Merge likely triggered (bar2/bar3=6?), but seeding used wrong pair or didn't apply vertically enough.
 * In Training 2 (background likely 1): Generated spread some 8's horizontally where original 8's present (e.g., row 5 has 8,8 at 8-9), and seeded nothing visibly, but expected shows seeding 8's at columns 4-5 and 8-9 early, plus a full 8-band in row 2 (positions 12-23), and left-spreading in row 4 (8's at 4-5,8-9,12-15?); generated missed vertical pillars (e.g., row 0 expected 8,8 at 4-5 but generated 1,1) and spreading in row 14 (expected full 8-band from 8-23, generated only 8,8 at 8-9). Merge triggered but initial pair detection failed or seeding didn't propagate spreading to non-original-8 rows.
 * In Training 3 (background likely 7): Generated spread 8's in some places (e.g., row 11 has full 8-band), but missed seeding 8's at columns 3-4 and 19-20 in top rows (expected 8,8 there vs generated 7,7); also incomplete vertical spreading (e.g., row 4 expected full 8-band from 0-13 vs generated partial 7's and 8,8 at 12-13); row 13 expected 8's at 3-4 and 12-13 with 6's preserved, but generated wrong. Bottom rows correct as no 8's. Merge triggered, but pair selection wrong (used existing 8's instead of specific merge positions).
 * extract_objects not present in attempts, but bar/background detection is essential and partially works; spread_row is helpful but broken for chaining full expansions and applying to seeded rows.
 * Common miss: Seeding doesn't trigger spreading in rows without original 8's; initial pair always picks first consecutive 8's, but expected suggests merge-specific positions (e.g., fixed columns or different pairs per example). Spreading doesn't handle vertical connections implicitly—needs per-row after seeding.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples. It shows heavy spreading of 8's in row 7 (full 8-band from 3-21?), but minimal elsewhere (e.g., top rows all 2's except bottom 3's, rows 3-5 all 9's, row 6 partial 1's then 9's, rows 8-10 full 8's but then back to 9's, row 16 full 9's, rows 17-18 partial 4's in middle). This mismatches expected behavior: if merge triggered (assuming bars include 6), we'd expect vertical 8-pillars seeding columns (e.g., 3-4 or similar) across all rows, then horizontal spreading into background (likely 9 or 2/3), creating more connected 8-regions (e.g., bands in top/mid rows like training); instead, it seems spreading only hit isolated rows, missing propagation (e.g., no 8's bleeding from row 7 to 6/8 fully, and bottom 4-block untouched but should spread if adjacent). No full bands in expected-like positions (e.g., row 14 in training 1/2), and abrupt shifts (e.g., row 6 has 1's at 0-2 then 9's, but row 7 jumps to 8's) suggest incomplete seeding or background misdetection. To handle test, need to apply spreading to ALL rows after seeding, not just original-8 rows, and possibly detect multiple seed pairs or fixed merge columns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely 25 rows total, but focusing on rows 6-24 for output) where the number 8 represents a spreading element (like ink or flood fill) that originates from initial pairs of adjacent 8's and expands horizontally in rows, while respecting "protected" areas defined by colored bars (non-zero values in specific bar positions) and the value 5. The spreading is conditional on a "merge" condition (when bar2 or bar3 is 6), and the goal is to simulate row-by-row evolution of the grid over 19 steps, avoiding overwriting protected cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses numbers as colors/states: 8 is the spreading agent that fills empty/unprotected spaces (likely 0's, though not explicitly shown); other numbers (1-9) are fixed colors or barriers that shouldn't be overwritten.
 * Bars are extracted from row 1 (g[1]), in fixed segments: bar1 (cols 1-4), bar2 (7-10), bar3 (13-16), bar4 (19-22), taking the first non-zero in each— these and 5 are protected from spreading.
 * Spreading only happens if there's a merge (bar2==6 or bar3==6); otherwise, output the original subgrid unchanged.
 * Initial 8-pair detection: Scan rows 6-24 for the first adjacent pair of 8's (positions i and i+1); this pair seeds spreading in subsequent rows if no existing 8's are present.
 * Spreading mechanic: In each row (starting from the row with the initial pair), if a row already has 8's, expand them left/right until hitting protected cells (bars or 5); if no 8's, place 8's at the initial pair positions (if unprotected). This is done sequentially for 19 output rows, but spreading seems cumulative or stateful across rows in some way (e.g., once spread in one row, it influences later rows).
 * Subtlety: Spreading is horizontal only, per row, but the simulation is over time (19 steps), so early rows may show initial seeds, while later rows show full expansion; however, the code treats it as independent per row with global initial pair.
 * Edge cases: Protected cells block spread but aren't overwritten; if initial pair positions are protected, don't place 8's there; bars can be 0 (no protection in that segment?); value 6 in bars triggers merge mode.
 * Rows are 24 elements long (0-indexed cols 0-23); output is exactly 19 rows (g[6:25] processed).
 * Potential misses: Spreading might need to propagate vertically or based on prior row states (code assumes independent rows); initial pair is global but applied per row without 8's; over-spreading into protected areas; missing right-side seeds in some examples (e.g., training 1 has initial 8's on right not detected); merge condition might enable bi-directional or full-grid spread.
 * Unclear: Exact input grid structure (full g not shown, but rows 6+ are the evolving part); what 0 represents (empty?); why some expected rows have sudden full 8 spreads (e.g., row 14 in training 1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)

    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6

            end = i - 1

                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j

            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(Expands existing 8-blocks left/right until protected; core spreading logic, but assumes input row already has 8's—doesn't handle seeding new 8's.)

The main `program` function orchestrates: computes bars/protected, checks merge, finds pair, then per row: if has 8's spread them, else seed pair if possible; outputs 19 rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; all three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding.
 * Worked: Correctly detects bars and protected set (including 5); implements horizontal spreading from existing 8's without overwriting protected; finds initial 8-pair and seeds it in rows without 8's; skips processing if no merge.
 * Didn't work: Spreading/seeding is too limited—applies initial pair globally to all non-8 rows without progression (e.g., doesn't simulate time-based growth from prior rows); over-spreads in some cases (e.g., training 1 row 7-8 fills entire middle with 8's, but expected has gaps); misses additional seeds (e.g., training 1 has right-side 8's at cols 16-17 not detected/spread initially); in non-merge? Wait, all examples seem to have merge but code assumes it.
 * Training 1 differences: Generated keeps initial 8's at cols 8-9 but misses right-side 8's (cols 16-17 in expected rows 0-6); row 8 spreads left to cols 4-7 (3's become 8's) but expected keeps them as 3's until later; row 9 reverts to 3's instead of keeping partial 8's (expected has 8's at 4-5 and 8-9); row 14 has no spread (all 3's) vs expected full 8's cols 4-21; bottom rows match (2's appear correctly, likely from input).
 * Training 2 differences: No initial spread to cols 4-5 (expected has 8's there from row 0); row 2 clears middle 8's too early (expected keeps and spreads right to cols 13-21); row 4 has no right spread (expected full 8's cols 13-21); row 10 reverts middle without left 8's (expected has 8's at 4-5); row 14 spreads bottom but misses full 8's in middle (expected cols 8-21); function assumes single pair but example has multiple seed areas.
 * Training 3 differences: Misses initial left 8's at cols 3-4 (expected from row 0); row 4 spreads too much left (fills cols 0-7 with 7's? Wait, generated has 7's but expected 8's); row 6 keeps partial but expected full 8's cols 0-11; row 11 over-spreads to full 8's cols 3-19 but expected only around seeds; row 14 misses right spread (expected 8's at 18-19); row 15 changes right to 7's too early vs expected 8's persisting.
 * `get_initial_pair` is helpful but broken for multiple pairs (returns only first, misses right-side in train1/2); `spread_row` is useful but doesn't handle seeding or vertical influence; main loop processes rows independently without state carryover (likely why spreads don't progress cumulatively).
 * No unhelpful functions— all provided are relevant, but `get_initial_pair` needs enhancement for all seeds.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows minimal 8's (only in rows 7-8 at cols 8-10, from apparent seed) and over-relies on input colors (lots of 2's top, 9's middle/bottom, 4's late), but spreading seems absent or blocked entirely after initial, with no progression (e.g., rows 0-2 all 2's, then sudden 9's in row 3 without transition; row 7 has partial 8's but row 10 reverts to 9's; row 17 has 4's starting at col 7 but no 8 integration). This mismatches puzzle expectation of gradual 8-spread if merge is true (assuming bars include 6 somewhere, not shown); likely misses detecting/handling initial pair (possibly at cols 8-9 based on 8's placement) and full horizontal expansion around it, plus no cumulative effect across rows (e.g., 8's should fill more of the 9's area over time). Without full input grid, hard to confirm exact expected, but patterns from training suggest more 8-filling in middle rows (e.g., around cols 4-20) before late 4's/9's dominate; current output feels static/input-copying rather than simulated evolution.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 24x24 grid where non-background components from rows 6+ are translated upward by 6 rows to form a new structure at the top, while adding structural "maroon" elements (color 8) as beams, pillars, and anchors based on the position and gaps around a key maroon bounding box; the background color fills the rest, and lower sections may include additional beams or translated elements depending on bottom components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected groups of the same color (4-directional adjacency), ignoring colors 0 and 5 (likely empty or invalid); only consider components starting from row 6 downward to avoid upper grid noise.
 * Background is the largest component by pixel count; exclude it and color 8 (maroon/structural) from translation, but only translate components with 24-63 pixels (suggesting rectangular or mid-sized objects; smaller/larger may be ignored or treated differently).
 * Maroon (8) acts as an "anchor" – compute its bounding box (bbox) only in rows 6+; shift it up by 6 rows, then derive "beams" by finding the leftmost/rightmost gaps (empty background columns) adjacent to the anchor's columns at the anchor's shifted row height.
 * Beams (horizontal 8's) fill from beam_left to beam_right across the anchor's shifted row range; upper pillars (vertical 8's) extend beams downward from fixed starts (e.g., columns 8 and 16 if anchor_slot==2, else beam edges), always placing as support even over other colors.
 * Lower pillars extend from beam ends and anchor base downward to row 23, only overwriting background (not other colors).
 * Lower beam: Placed one row above the highest row of the bottommost translated component; its extent varies by anchor_slot (e.g., full width if slot==2 and relative3==1, else to anchor max_c); only overwrite background.
 * Top bars: Uniform color columns in rows 1-4 (excluding 0,5) may indicate slots or relative positions (e.g., bars[2]-12 for relative3); anchor_slot = min_c // 6 (likely 0-3 for positioning logic).
 * Subtle: Pillars/beams can overwrite translated components in some cases (upper always, lower only bg); bottom component is the one with max row in cells (after shift); if no translated, default bg=3 but this may not trigger.
 * Edge cases: Anchor may not span full height/width; beams/pillars widths are fixed (e.g., pillar_width=2) or derived (anchor_width); relative3 uses top bars (assumes 4 bars); test inputs may have varying bg (e.g., 3,1,7) and need to preserve non-8 translations accurately.
 * Potential misses: Overwriting non-bg in lower areas blocks pillar extension; incorrect beam_left/right if no gap (defaults to 0/23); lower beam row calc (bottom_min_r -1) may go negative/out-of-bounds; components <24 or >63 pixels ignored (e.g., small debris or large bg-like); top bars assume exactly 4, else relative3=1 (may fail if fewer bars).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of structural additions (beams/pillars) and overwriting rules.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8's in upper-left (cols 4-5, rows 0-2/12-23) where expected has bg (3); missed full 8 beam in row 14 (cols 4-23); no 2's in rows 16-18 (expected bottom translated?); lower pillars/beam incomplete or wrong extent; translated 1's and 4's mostly correct but beams overwrite incorrectly.
 * Train 1: Top bars and relative3 logic placed pillars wrong (e.g., left_upper_start=8 but generated starts at 4); beam_left/right miscalc (used shifted_min_r=7? leading to left_trans_right wrong); lower beam row wrong (placed at row 11? but expected none, instead full 8's lower).
 * Train 2: Generated bg=1 correctly but filled lower rows (12-23) entirely with 1's/bg where expected has 8 beams (rows 14-15 cols 8-23), 4's (rows 16-18 cols 5-13), and 6's (rows 0-2 cols 13-17); missed translating/preserving 6's and 4's properly; pillars/beams only in upper, no lower extension; top bars logic failed (bars likely at cols 4,14? but relative3 wrong).
 * Train 2: Bottom component (likely 4's) not used for lower beam (expected row 15 full 8's); beam_left/right calc ignored gaps around anchor (min_c~8?); overwrote nothing in lower, leaving all bg.
 * Train 3: Generated mismatched top (7's instead of 3's in cols 8-17 rows 0-2); extra 8's in row 4 cols 0-3/20-23; wrong pillar widths (e.g., row 6 cols 3-7 as 8's but expected 7's); missed full 8's in row 4 cols 0-23?; bottom 4's in rows 16-18 cols 8-21 correct but surrounding 7's wrong; 6's translated but pillar overwrite incomplete.
 * Train 3: Bg=7 correct, but anchor bbox miscalc (min_c~0? leading to slot=0, wrong upper starts); relative3 from bars wrong (bars at 8,18?); lower beam not placed (expected none, but generated partial); function get_maroon_bbox scans correctly but beam fill uses wrong r_anchor.
 * Overall: Translation of non-8 components works partially (positions/sizes ok in upper), but beam/pillar placement fails due to incorrect gap detection (left_trans_right/right_trans_left often defaults wrong); lower logic (pillars only on bg, beam extent by slot/relative3) inconsistent; size filter 24-63 may exclude key elements (e.g., Train 2's 6's or 4's?); top bars assume 4 but may vary.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but get_top_bars assumes uniform rows 1-4 (may miss if not uniform); beam calc in program() fragile (uses single r_anchor, may miss if anchor not uniform height; left_trans_right scans only left of min_c but may find wrong edge if multiple components).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have translated components upward (e.g., 9's from lower to rows 3-5/13-23, 1's to rows 6-10/11-12, 3's as bg in cols 21-23), and placed some 8 pillars/beams (cols 3-4 throughout, row 7 cols 5-19 as 8's), but inconsistencies suggest errors: upper rows 0-2 have 2's in cols 0-2/5-19 where likely bg or different translation expected (2's may be unfiltered small component); row 5 has mixed 8's and 9's breaking beam continuity; lower rows 13-23 have 9's overwriting potential pillars (e.g., cols 5-20 should be 8's if lower pillars extend, but 9's persist); no clear lower beam (e.g., above bottom 9's at row 23, expected row 22 full 8's?); right side cols 19-20 have 8's but then 3's abruptly, suggesting wrong beam_right (gap detection failed around anchor min_c~?); overall, lacks full structural support (beams/pillars not spanning anchor bbox properly), and 3's in lower-right may be bg but positioned as if untranslated debris; does not match puzzle rules as beams/pillars seem partial/underfilled, and small 2's/3's suggest size filter or component detection missed filtering.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the number 8 (likely representing a spreading "ink" or fill) must be propagated or "spread" across certain rows in a subgrid (rows 6-24 of a larger grid), while respecting barriers defined by colored bars, protected cells, and special merge conditions. The goal is to transform the input grid by filling unprotected areas with 8s based on initial seeds or pairs, but avoiding overwriting specific colors or structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a header row (g[1]) with bar colors in specific segments (e.g., columns 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22, skipping zeros), which define protected colors that 8s cannot overwrite during spreading.
 * Protected set includes bar colors plus 5 (possibly a universal barrier or empty space indicator).
 * Merge condition triggers only if bar2 or bar3 is 6, potentially allowing special placement of initial 8 pairs in rows without existing 8s.
 * Initial pair detection looks for the first consecutive pair of 8s (count >=2) in subgrid rows, but placement is conditional on merge and only in rows lacking any 8s originally; however, this seems overly restrictive and doesn't propagate the pair across rows.
 * Spreading function expands contiguous 8s left/right until hitting protected cells or grid edges, but only applied to rows that originally contain 8s; it skips rows without 8s except via the pair logic.
 * Subtleties: Spreading is row-wise only (no vertical propagation), and initial seeds might need to be placed or detected differently—e.g., pairs may indicate starting points for vertical or multi-row fills. Protected cells block but don't get filled. Bars might represent dividers that 8s can't cross vertically or horizontally. In examples, 8s often form blobs or lines that align with non-protected areas, suggesting connected component filling. Easy to miss: Some rows need 8s inserted even without originals if they align with vertical continuity from above/below; merge=6 might enable crossing a central barrier. Original 8s must be preserved and expanded, but not all empty (0 or other) cells get filled—only those adjacent to 8s. Grid is 19 rows deep for subgrid, but spreading doesn't handle multi-row connectivity well.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)
    bar2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    bar3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    bar4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts the four bar colors correctly from header, useful for defining protected sets.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2: int, bar3: int) -> bool:
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(Simple but key for detecting special merge cases that allow extra 8 placements.)

```python
def spread_row(row: List[int], protected: set) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row.copy()
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This performs horizontal spreading from existing 8 blocks, avoiding protected; core logic for expansion but limited to single rows and doesn't handle vertical.)

```python
def get_initial_pair(g: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for row in g[6:25]:
        i = 0
        n = len(row)
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == 8:
                start = i
                count = 0
                while i < n and row[i] == 8:
                    i += 1
                    count += 1
                if count >= 2:
                    return (start, start + 1)
            else:
                i += 1
    return None
```
(Detects first pair of consecutive 8s for seeding, but returns only positions in one row; useful but incomplete as it doesn't propagate vertically or check all rows.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating the core spreading and seeding logic is flawed—e.g., it under-fills 8s in areas that should connect vertically or across barriers under merge conditions.
 * Train 1: Generated spread 8s correctly in some central rows (e.g., full 8s in rows 7-8 matching expected), but failed to place 8s in right-side positions (e.g., expected 8,8 in columns 16-17 for top rows, but generated 3,3; also missed vertical extension in rows 9-11 where expected 8,8 in cols 4-5 but generated 3,3; row 14 has no 8s in cols 4-7 where expected full 8s). Pair placement didn't trigger properly, and spreading didn't extend to non-original-8 rows. What worked: Protected 3 and 4 areas correctly; horizontal spreads in seeded rows.
 * Train 2: Generated initial 8,8 pairs in cols 8-9 correctly for top rows, but missed left-side 8s in cols 4-5 (expected 8,8 but generated 1,1); row 2 expected 8s in cols 14-21 but generated 6s/1s; central merge (bar3=6?) not handled to fill row 2 cols 14-21 with 8s; bottom rows under-filled (e.g., row 14 expected full 8s cols 8-23 but generated partial). What worked: Spread in row 8-9 full 8s; protected 1,3,6 areas. Pair detection missed or not applied vertically.
 * Train 3: Generated some 8 spreads (e.g., cols 12-13 in middle rows), but missed left extensions (e.g., top rows expected 8,8 in cols 3-4 but generated 7,7; row 4 expected 8,8 cols 3-4 but generated 7,7); row 5 over-filled with 7s where expected 8s cols 0-11; vertical blobs not connected (e.g., row 14 expected 8s cols 20-23 but generated 6s). What worked: Right-side 6 protections; some horizontal spreads in row 11-12. Merge (bar4=6?) not enabling cross-bar fills.
 * get_initial_pair is helpful for seeding but broken in application—only places in one row and only if no original 8s, missing vertical propagation; don't rely on it alone.
 * has_eight (checks if 8 in row) is simple but useful for identifying seed rows; however, the main program logic skips spreading on non-seed rows too aggressively.
 * Overall, attempts show understanding of bars/protected but fail on vertical connectivity, merge-enabled fills across central areas (e.g., when bar=6, 8s might bridge gaps), and inserting seeds in empty rows based on alignment rather than single pair.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it over-fills with 9s in many areas (e.g., rows 3-6 full 9s where 8s should spread instead, assuming 9 is a bar color but spreading logic treated it wrong); row 7 has 1s in cols 0-2 then full 8s, but if vertical from above, more 8s expected in left; rows 13-16 full 9s bottom-right, but spreading should stop at protected 3s in cols 21-23; row 17 full 9s, row 18 partial 4s in center but no 8s where seeds might start. It ignores potential vertical 8 propagation from row 7-10's 8s downward, and pair/merge not detected (no initial 8 pair found?). This suggests the program didn't extract bars correctly (bars seem 2 left, 9 center/right, 3/4 bottom), leading to wrong protected set; output looks like it copied input without proper 8 spreading, making it incoherent for a fill puzzle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to detect a background color, shift and clean the main content into a 19-row output grid, identify a central "maroon" object (color 8) bounding box, and then augment the grid by adding maroon (8) elements to form structural extensions like vertical risers, horizontal connectors, and bottom fills that frame or connect the maroon object to surrounding elements, while respecting spans, gaps, and conditional placements based on other non-background objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent non-0, non-5 color in the input's rows 6-23 (likely the "empty" or filler space); defaults to 3 if tied or unclear.
 * Content shifting extracts rows 6-23 of input into rows 0-18 of output, replacing 0s and 5s with background, and duplicates the last row if needed to fill 19 rows—ensures no original borders or artifacts remain.
 * Maroon object (color 8) bounding box (min/max row/col) is extracted from input rows 6-23, shifted to 0-based output coordinates; if absent, defaults to invalid (0,0,0,0) which may skip augmentations.
 * Horizontal span calculation for the maroon's y-range finds the minimal left/right bounds that cover all non-bg cells in that vertical slice, effectively determining a "coverage width" that may extend beyond the maroon itself to include nearby objects.
 * Upward verticals (risers) are placed as 8's above the maroon: always internal (over maroon cols), always right-aligned (shifted to end of span), and conditionally left-aligned if there's a left-side object whose vertical extent is close enough (distance <= maroon_width +1) to justify connection.
 * Horizontal shorts place 8's directly over the maroon and span positions within the maroon's y-range, but only on bg cells; gaps between sorted positions are connected horizontally with 8's in the y-range only if the entire gap above (rows 0 to y1-1) is clear of non-bg.
 * Downward verticals start right after maroon (y2+1) and extend to a fixed row 13; placed for internal (maroon cols), conditional left (if left object extends below maroon by >= maroon_width +1), and always right; if down height matches maroon height, full horizontal connection across all down positions in those rows.
 * Bottom full fill starts at row 14, height matching maroon height (up to row 18), spanning from leftmost down position to either full width (if no right extensions below row 13) or rightmost down position; only on bg cells.
 * Subtleties: All placements overwrite only bg cells (no overwriting existing content); connections require clear space above/below for verticals; fixed row limits (e.g., down to 13, bottom from 14) suggest a structured output height with distinct zones (top for risers, middle for object, bottom for base); spans must account for all non-bg in y-range to avoid narrow framing; left/right placements are asymmetric and conditional on nearby object extents (e.g., left_start_y, right_end_y, left_end_y); maroon_width drives many decisions (e.g., connection lengths); potential for overfilling if conditions misapplied, like placing left up/down too aggressively.
 * Edge cases: No maroon (skip augmentations?); maroon near edges (clamp to 0/width-1); varying object positions (left, center, right) affect span and connections; heights may not align perfectly, so fixed down_y2=13 acts as a cap; output is always 19 rows x input width, with last input row duplicated if short.
 * Across attempts: Preserve original non-8, non-bg content exactly (e.g., 1's, 2's, 4's, 6's, 9's); 8's only added, never removed; consider full-width bottoms only if no protruding right objects.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    for c in range(16):
        if counts[c] == max_count:
            return c
    return 3  # default
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most common non-0/5 in content area; useful for cleaning.)

```python
def shift_content(g, bg):
    width = len(g[0])

    # copy last row
    if height_out > 0:

    return right_end_y
```
(Finds vertical extent of right-side objects after end col; useful for bottom span decisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly detects bg (e.g., 3 in train 1, 1 in train 2/3) and shifts content without artifacts, preserving original shapes like the 1's block, 2's base, 4's bottom in train 1.
 * Upward verticals partially work: internal and right placements add 8's correctly in many spots (e.g., train 1 rows 0-2 over maroon cols 8-9), but left up is overplaced or missing (train 1: no left 8's in rows 0-3 cols 0-4 where expected; train 2: misplaced left 8's in rows 0-2 cols 0-3 instead of cols 4-5).
 * Horizontal shorts/connects fail consistently: shorts overplace 8's (train 1 rows 4-11 cols 0-3 have 1's unchanged but expected 8's in rows 7-8 cols 4-7; no connection between left/middle in row 12); gaps not connected properly (train 2: no horizontal 8's in row 2 cols 11-19 where expected full connect; train 3: overconnects in rows 4-6 cols 0-7 with 7's unchanged to 8's incorrectly).
 * Downward verticals are incomplete: internal/right placed but left conditional wrong (train 1: no left down 8's in rows 12-13 cols 0-3; train 3: down in rows 12-13 cols 12-13 correct but no full connect); height match for full down connect misapplied (train 2: down height=3 but no wide 8's in rows 11-13 cols 4-20).
 * Bottom full miscalculates span/end: overfills or underfills (train 1: rows 14-16 cols 0-23 with 8's but expected only partial; train 3: row 14-16 cols 0-3 and 8-23 but generated full 8's incorrectly; train 2: no bottom 8's at all, just original 4's).
 * calculate_span often computes wrong bounds (train 1: start=0, end=23? leading to full-width overplacements; train 2: narrow span misses right extensions); conditions like place_left_up/down use wrong thresholds (e.g., <= maroon_width +1 too loose, causing phantom lefts).
 * find_left_start_end and find_right_end_y are helpful but underused—e.g., left_start_y=100 (no left object) should skip left up, but code places it anyway in some cases; right_end_y <=13 for full bottom not triggering correctly.
 * pos_list and sorted_pos for horizontals/down are conceptually good for multi-object connects but fail on gap checking (can_connect checks rows 0-y1 but places in y1-y2, and breaks early without full scan).
 * No removal of existing 8's—assumes clean shift, but if input has extras, they persist.
 * Train 1 mismatches: generated keeps left 1's in rows 4-11 cols 0-3 (correct) but misses extending 8's left in rows 7-8 cols 4-7 to connect to 1's; row 12 has 3's where expected 8's cols 4-5; bottom rows 14-16 overfill with 8's cols 0-3 instead of stopping at 4.
 * Train 2 mismatches: generated places 8's in wrong left positions (rows 0-4 cols 1-2 instead of cols 4-5); row 2 has fragmented 8's cols 13-17/19 instead of full cols 11-20; down missing entirely (rows 11-13 all 1's/bg where expected 8's cols 4-5/14-15/19?); bottom 4's unchanged but no 8's added.
 * Train 3 mismatches: generated misses left extensions (rows 0-3 cols 0-3 should be 8's over 7's? but expected cols 3-4 8's); rows 4-6 cols 0-7 all 7's unchanged instead of 8's cols 0-11; row 11 overconnects cols 4-23 with 8's but expected partial; bottom row 14 has 8's cols 3-23 but expected cols 0-23 except gaps.
 * Function calculate_span is broken in end_span logic (sets to width-1 on no right non-bg, causing full-width spans incorrectly); find_right_end_y returns -1 if no right objects, but code uses <=13 which may false-positive.
 * The down_connect_pos appending right without condition leads to unintended full spans; bottom_y2 = min(18, 14 + maroon_height -1) is good but start_full/end_full logic fails when down_pos empty (falls back to maroon, missing extensions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overplaces 8's extensively (e.g., rows 7-13 cols 3-20 all 8's, row 14 full 8's cols 3-23, rows 15-16 full 8's) while leaving original 9's and 1's fragmented without proper connections—e.g., no upward risers above the maroon in rows 0-3 cols 8-10/20, and bottom row 17-18 has partial 8's cols 0-2/16-23 mixing with 4's/9's instead of a clean full base; this suggests span calc went full-width incorrectly, and left/right conditionals failed to limit to maroon-adjacent objects (e.g., the left 9's block and right 3's aren't connected properly with shorts/verticals). It mismatches training patterns by not preserving object shapes (e.g., 9's in rows 4-6 cols 0-7/11-19 overwritten partially) and lacks gap-aware connects (e.g., no clear horizontal in row 6 cols 10-19). To handle test, need tighter span (only cover maroon + immediate neighbors), stricter left/right y-extent checks (e.g., distance thresholds based on actual object heights), and bg-only overwrites to avoid smashing 9's/1's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based structure (likely a building or platform) where the goal is to identify key colored components (e.g., supports, floors, and special elements like maroon blobs) and fill in background areas with a structural color (8, appearing as maroon) to complete supports and horizontal floors, while shifting the grid upward to simulate a "build" or "completion" effect. The output modifies the input grid by replacing background pixels with 8 in specific vertical and horizontal regions based on component positions, ensuring structural integrity without overwriting non-background elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid has 30 rows (0-29), but processing focuses on rows 6-23 for analysis; the shift_up function copies rows 6-23 to output rows 0-17 and row 23 to row 18, effectively cropping out top rows (0-5) and bottom row (24-29?) to create a 19-row output, which may simulate removing a "ground" or "sky" layer.
 * Background color (C) is the most common non-zero, non-5 color in rows 6-23, excluding 5 (possibly a special "void" or "edge" color); fills only replace C with 8, preserving other colors like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9.
 * Components are rectangular blobs of the same color, size >=4, found via flood-fill-like expansion (horizontal then vertical), excluding C, 0, and 5; they represent structural elements like platforms, walls, or objects.
 * Supports are vertical fills (full height or partial) at specific columns: left starts after the right edge of the leftmost non-8 component; middle uses the maroon (8) component's column range; right starts 2 columns left of the rightmost upper non-8 component (above bottom component).
 * Floors are horizontal fills with 8: for an upper "floor1" at the shifted maroon height (small_minr-6 to small_maxr-6), spanning left to right supports; if "far" (floor1 max row +2 < base row), add a base horizontal at (bottom_minr-6)-2 spanning from bottom component's left to grid right.
 * Subtleties: Maroon (8) components are treated specially (e.g., as middle support or "small" element), but input may already have 8s that shouldn't be overwritten; right support is often partial (only up to floor1 height, not full); "is_far" logic detects multi-level structures; bottom component is the lowest non-8; no diagonal or non-rectangular shapes—assumes axis-aligned rectangles; 5 may be ignored as non-fillable; output must match exactly, including preserving non-C areas.
 * Edge cases: No non-maroon components defaults left support to col 4; no upper components defaults right to col 20; base horizontal only from bottom_start if far; horizontal fills are 1-2 rows thick, but code varies (e.g., floor1_min to floor1_max vs single row).
 * All fills are conditional on C only, so over-filling (e.g., replacing non-C) or under-filling (missing partial supports) breaks outputs; grid width is 24 columns consistently.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of support/floor logic, especially partial fills and multi-level detection.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8 fills in left/middle areas (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 0-3 filled with 8 instead of preserving 3; row 7-8 full 8 horizontal too wide, overwriting 3s; bottom rows 16-18 have 8s in cols 17-18 where expected 3s; row 11-12 have 8s in cols 18-19 where expected 3s/4s). Missed preserving background 3 in non-support areas; overfilled right support below floor1; horizontal floor1 at single row instead of range; is_far logic failed, no base horizontal added correctly.
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled 8s in upper areas (e.g., row 2 cols 6-17 all 8, but expected partial with 1s; row 4 cols 16-17=3 but filled 8? Wait, input has 3 there?); row 9-10 full 8 in cols 6-17 overwriting 1s; bottom rows 16-18 have 8 in col 5 and cols 17-18 where expected 1s; missed narrowing middle support to avoid overwriting 6s/3s; right support too wide/full height; horizontal in row 14-15 too narrow, missing full span.
 * Train 3: Generated partial 8 fills incorrectly (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 18-19=8 but expected 7/8 mix; row 4 cols 0-7=7 but expected 8 full; row 12 full 8 horizontal but expected partial; row 14 cols 20-21=6 but filled 8?; row 16-18 cols 0-2=2 preserved but cols 3-5=8 where expected 7). Underfilled upper supports (e.g., row 4-6 left/middle not fully 8); overfilled right in lower areas; base horizontal in row 16-18 cols 8-21=4 preserved but supports wrong; get_bottom_comp likely buggy (max min_r picks wrong "bottom").
 * Overall: Component detection works (finds blobs), but positioning (e.g., right_start -2) and fill ranges (partial right, is_far for base) fail consistently; shift_up preserves structure but fills ignore levels; no handling for pre-existing 8s or color-specific rules (e.g., 6/4 as special); unhelpful: get_right_support_start filters upper but defaults high (20), causing wide overfills; fill functions are safe but applied wrongly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills with 8 in central columns (e.g., cols 8-19 rows 3-16 mostly 8, creating a wide "pillar" that overwrites what should be preserved 9s/1s for structure), while leaving top rows 0-2 all 2s (correct preservation?) but bottom row 18 has 4s starting col 7 (partial, but spans to col 16 with 9s/8s mismatched). Expected likely narrower supports (e.g., left at col 0-3 for 1s? No, test input has 2s top, 9s middle, 1s lower left, 4s bottom partial), with vertical 8s only at edges/middle based on components (e.g., maroon? None visible, so defaults fail); horizontals missing for floors (e.g., no 8 row at 1s height or base); right support seems partial but too low (row 13-16 cols 20-23=8/9 mix wrong); is_far probably misdetected, no base fill; overall, looks like generic overfill without adapting to test's tall 9/1 stack and right-edge 3s—suggests program assumes maroon presence and fixed widths, breaking on test's layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle simulating the flow or spread of a special element (represented by 8, possibly liquid or filler) across a background in a 19x24 subgrid (rows 6-24 of input), where it expands into adjacent background cells based on rules involving colored bars, pillars (vertical lines of 8), and merging conditions, while preserving other colored objects and filling voids (0 or 5) with background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the most common non-zero, non-5 color in the lower subgrid (rows 6-24), excluding 8; this fills all 0 and 5 cells initially, but 8 can overwrite bg cells during spreading.
 * Four horizontal bars (b1-b4) are extracted from row 1 at specific column ranges (1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22); their colors (non-zero) influence behavior—e.g., b2 or b3 == 6 triggers "merge" mode for bidirectional spreading.
 * Spreading of 8 occurs only in rows that originally contain 8; it expands leftward (or both directions in merge mode) into contiguous bg cells adjacent to 8 blocks, but does not cross non-bg cells or other colors.
 * Pillars are vertical columns containing any 8 in the input subgrid; in merge mode, these are pre-filled with 8 in every output row where the cell is bg, creating persistent vertical spread paths.
 * Subtleties: Spreading is per-row and only activates if the row has 8 initially; pillars add 8 to bg cells in those columns before spreading, but only in merge mode; repeated identical rows in output suggest no change or full fill; 8 blocks are treated as contiguous segments for expansion, but do not merge across non-bg gaps.
 * Easy to miss: get_background excludes 8 and 5 correctly, but flat list must avoid empty cases; bar extraction takes first non-zero in each segment; spreading loops must handle multiple 8 segments per row without overlapping incorrectly; output preserves original non-bg, non-8 colors exactly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Merge mode (b2/b3==6) should enable bidirectional spread and pillar pre-filling, but non-merge uses only leftward spread without pillars; pillars are global (from all input rows) but applied row-by-row; no vertical spreading—everything is horizontal per row; test inputs may have unique bar configs or pillar positions requiring exact column tracking.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [g[r][c] for r in range(6, 25) for c in range(24) if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != 5]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode color, excluding voids and 8; useful for initial fill.)

```python
def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    row = g[1]
    b1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)
    b2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    b3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    b4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return b1, b2, b3, b4
```
(This extracts bar colors from fixed positions in row 1; essential for determining merge/spread mode.)

```python
def has_merge(b2: int, b3: int) -> bool:
    return b2 == 6 or b3 == 6
```
(Simple but key for toggling bidirectional spread and pillar usage.)

```python
def spread_left(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] == bg:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            i = end + 1
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(Handles leftward expansion from 8 blocks into bg; useful for non-merge cases, but note it skips rightward.)

```python
def spread_both(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] == bg:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] == bg:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(Extends leftward + rightward; critical for merge mode, handles contiguous bg on both sides.)

```python
def get_pillar_cols(g: List[List[int]]) -> list:
    cols = set()
    for r in range(6, 25):
        for c in range(24):
            if g[r][c] == 8:
                cols.add(c)
    return list(cols)
```
(Identifies all columns with any 8 for pre-filling in merge mode; helpful but only applied conditionally.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt processes the subgrid correctly (rows 6-24 into 19 output rows) and applies bg fill to 0/5, but all three training examples fail due to incorrect spreading and pillar handling.
 * Train 1 (likely non-merge): Generated spreads 8 leftward in some rows but fails to place additional 8s in columns 16-17 (expected 8,8 there in top rows and some middle); also misses leftward fill in row 9-10 (expected 8,8 in cols 4-5) and full horizontal 8 spread in row 14-15 (generated has gaps at cols 6-15,17-23); bottom rows match expected 2s and 3s.
 * Train 2 (merge mode, b3=6?): Generated incorrectly places initial 8s only in cols 8-9 without pillars, leading to no spread into cols 4-5 or 14-21; row 2 has no rightward 8s in cols 14-21 (expected full 8,8,1... but wait, expected has 8s in 4-5 and 8-9, then 14-21); row 14 has no 8s in cols 8-15,17-23 (expected full 8s there); preserves 6s and 4s correctly but misses bidirectional expansion.
 * Train 3 (merge mode?): Generated pre-fills pillars (cols 12-13?) but spreads incorrectly—e.g., row 0-2 have 3s in cols 8-17 instead of expected 3s only in 8-17 with 8s in 0-3,20-23? Wait, expected has 8s in 3-4 and 19-20; row 4 has 7s in cols 8-11 instead of full 8s; row 11-12 have 8s only in 3-15? but expected full 8s 3-21; row 14 has 7s in 20-23 instead of 6s? No, expected has 6s preserved but 8s around; overall, pillar pre-fill happens but spreading doesn't connect properly, and some original colors like 6s are overwritten incorrectly.
 * What worked: Bg detection and fill seem accurate (e.g., 3s in Train 1, 1s in Train 2); bar extraction and merge detection likely correct (activates both-spread in Trains 2/3); per-row 8 presence check prevents unwanted spreading; preserves non-bg elements like 1s,2s,4s,6s.
 * What didn't: Pillar pre-fill in merge mode is applied to all rows but only where bg, yet doesn't lead to correct connections (e.g., no vertical propagation, but horizontal spread from them fails); spreading functions expand correctly for isolated 8s but miss multi-segment or pillar-induced fills; in non-merge, no pillars means isolated left-spreads only; loop in spread_both sets i=j after right spread, which skips if no right bg but may miss multiple segments; get_pillar_cols collects all 8-cols but in Train 1 (non-merge) it's unused, causing misses.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, but the main program integration (applying pillars before spread, conditional spread) is buggy; e.g., pillars added after bg fill but before spread, yet in Train 1 expected has 8s in non-pillar cols.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows excessive 2s and 9s in early rows with 8s only in row 7 (cols 3-10?), but no clear spreading pattern—e.g., row 0-2 are all 2s except right 3s, row 3-5 all 9s with right 3s, row 6 has 1s then 9s, row 7 has 1s,8s,9s, but expected likely involves bg=3 or 9?, bars determining merge (possibly b4=3 irrelevant, check b2/b3), pillars from input 8s (maybe col 3?), and spreading 8s bidirectionally if merge, filling into bg but preserving 1s/4s; instead, it seems to ignore pillars entirely (no vertical 8s persisting), spreads minimally left-only in row 7 without connecting to row 6's potential, and row 17-18 have 4s in cols 7-16 but no 8 integration, suggesting broken pillar or merge detection for this input's bar colors (possibly no merge, but still misses left-spreads); overall, lacks the connected 8 fills seen in expected trains, like full rows or extended segments.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on direct comparison across all three train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent in **every** example. These are limited to properties (e.g., position, color, holes, bbox, pixels) that reliably link input elements to output elements without variation or ambiguity. Only elements with clear, direct mappings are included; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the top orange frame, which is always present in input but entirely absent in output with no traceable effect) are excluded. No high-level interpretations or puzzle solutions are provided. Unknown mappings (e.g., exact rules for fragmentation or bbox adjustments) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Lower Rectangular Elements (Non-Background, Non-Maroon) – Position to Position/Color/Holes/Bbox/Pixels Preservation via Translation**
   - **Description**: Specific rectangular elements in the input (below y≈6, excluding the large background and small Maroon) consistently undergo a uniform vertical translation in the output: every y-coordinate (min and max in bbox) is decreased by exactly 6 units. All other properties (color, holes, bbox width/height dimensions, pixel count) are preserved exactly. These elements do not interact with other components during this transformation; it is isolated to their own properties.
   - **Affected Components**: Thin-to-wide rectangles of various colors (e.g., Blue, Pink, Green, Yellow, Red), always with holes=0 and pixels matching row-like fills (e.g., 24–44). They appear in the input's mid-to-lower area (y≥6, often starting at y=6–13) and span widths of 2–14 units.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Blue ([0,9,3,17], holes=0, pixels=36) → Blue ([0,3,3,11], holes=0, pixels=36); Yellow ([18,10,21,16], holes=0, pixels=28) → Yellow ([18,4,21,10], holes=0, pixels=28); Red ([4,22,14,24], holes=0, pixels=33) → Red ([4,16,14,18], holes=0, pixels=33).
     - Train 2: Pink ([13,6,17,7], holes=0, pixels=10) → Pink ([13,0,17,1], holes=0, pixels=10); Green ([16,11,19,16], holes=0, pixels=24) → Green ([16,5,19,10], holes=0, pixels=24); Red ([0,11,3,17], holes=0, pixels=28) → Red ([0,5,3,11], holes=0, pixels=28); Yellow ([5,22,12,24], holes=0, pixels=24) → Yellow ([5,16,12,18], holes=0, pixels=24).
     - Train 3: Green ([8,6,17,9], holes=0, pixels=40) → Green ([8,0,17,3], holes=0, pixels=40); Pink ([20,9,23,19], holes=0, pixels=44) → Pink ([20,3,23,13], holes=0, pixels=44); Red ([0,13,2,24], holes=0, pixels=36) → Red ([0,7,2,18], holes=0, pixels=36); Yellow ([8,22,21,24], holes=0, pixels=42) → Yellow ([8,16,21,18], holes=0, pixels=42).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input y-position (min/max) → output y-position (min/max, shifted -6); color → color (unchanged); holes=0 → holes=0 (unchanged); bbox width/height → bbox width/height (unchanged); pixels → pixels (unchanged).
   - **Notes**: This applies to 3–4 such elements per input, always preserving shape integrity. No horizontal (x) changes or interactions with other elements (e.g., no overlap effects or color blending observed). In the test input, analogous elements (Red [0,6,20,8], Green [21,6,23,18], Blue [0,12,2,21], Yellow [7,23,15,25]) match this profile and would follow the same translation if processed.

#### 2. **Small Maroon Element – Size/Position to Large Maroon Frame (Partial Mapping, Details Unknown)**
   - **Description**: A single small Maroon element in every input (central-lower position) consistently maps to a single large Maroon element in every output, expanding to cover a broad top-mid frame area (y=0 to ≈15, x spanning most of width). Pixels increase significantly (from ~4–9 to ~116–138), and bbox expands in all directions. However, exact rules for bbox adjustments, hole count, and pixel increase are unknown (variable and not directly derivable from input properties).
   - **Affected Components**: Input: Small Maroon (holes=0, pixels=4–9, bbox ≈[8–12,13–17,9–13,14–18], narrow width 1–2, height 1–2). Output: Large Maroon (bbox ≈[0–4,0,19–23,15], width 15–19, height 15; holes=0–2; pixels=116–138).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input ([8,13,9,14], holes=0, pixels=4) → Output ([4,0,23,15], holes=1, pixels=116).
     - Train 2: Input ([8,14,9,15], holes=0, pixels=4) → Output ([4,0,23,15], holes=0, pixels=124).
     - Train 3: Input ([12,17,13,18], holes=0, pixels=4) → Output ([0,0,19,15], holes=2, pixels=138).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input color (Maroon) → output color (Maroon, unchanged); input presence (always 1 small instance) → output presence (always 1 large instance); input position (central x≈8–12, lower y≈13–17) → output position (top-mid frame, x-start ≈0–4, x-end ≈19–23 influenced by input x? – unknown exact mapping); input holes=0 → output holes (variable 0–2, no direct link); input pixels (~4) → output pixels (~120, scaled up but unknown rule); input bbox (small) → output bbox (expanded, height fixed to 15 but width variable).
   - **Notes**: This is the only consistent color-to-color expansion observed. No interactions with other elements (e.g., no merging with shifted rects). In the test input, the Maroon ([8,13,10,15], holes=0, pixels=9) matches the input profile (slightly wider bbox but same scale). Hole variability and exact bbox/pixel scaling are unknown and inconsistent.

#### 3. **Background Element – Color to Multiple Output Segments (Fragmentation, Positions Unknown)**
   - **Description**: The large background element in every input (holes=2, lower-area coverage, color varies) consistently determines the color of multiple smaller segments in every output (same color, scattered as thin-to-wide rects forming apparent paths). Total output pixels for these segments are reduced (not preserved), and they are fragmented into 4–9 pieces. Exact fragmentation rules (e.g., count, positions, sizes, bbox derivation) are unknown.
   - **Affected Components**: Input: Large background (holes=2, bbox ≈[0,6–9,23,24–29], pixels=290–408, color=Green/Blue/Dark Red/Light Blue). Output: 4–9 segments of matching color (holes=0, varied bbox like [0–23,0–18] spans, pixels=3–96 each, total ~150–250).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Input Green (holes=2, pixels=355) → Output 6 Green segments (total pixels=243, e.g., [0,0,7,6] pixels=40).
     - Train 2: Input Blue (holes=2, pixels=366) → Output 7 Blue segments (total pixels=246, e.g., [0,0,3,4] pixels=20).
     - Train 3: Input Dark Red (holes=1, pixels=290; note: holes=1 but pattern holds for color) → Output 9 Dark Red segments (total pixels=156, e.g., [0,0,2,3] pixels=12).
   - **Interconnected Properties**: Input color (background) → output color (multiple segments, unchanged); input holes=2 (or 1) → output holes=0 (all segments, no preservation); input pixels (~300–400) → output pixels (reduced total ~150–250, unknown scaling); input bbox (lower full-width) → output bbox (scattered, often top-mid y=0–18, full-ish x=0–23 but fragmented – positions unknown).
   - **Notes**: These output segments do not interact directly with shifted rects or Maroon frame in a consistent way (e.g., no fixed overlaps or color changes). No shape preservation (input is broad with holes; outputs are rects without holes). In the test input, Light Blue background (holes=2, pixels=408) matches the profile, implying output segments would be Light Blue.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., top small elements [y=1–4, pixels=4] have no direct mappings to output components across all examples; their positions/colors do not reliably affect any specific output property like color or bbox). Background changes (green grid-like to blue water-like) are descriptive but not tied to specific element interactions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python

    bar3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    bar4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 23:31:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a special spreading color (8) originates from seed positions in a grid and floods into adjacent background areas, but is blocked by protected colors (derived from side bars and special elements like 5), forming connected blobs that can span horizontally and vertically. The goal is to simulate this spread correctly on the working area (rows 6:25 of the grid), preserving non-background and protected elements while overwriting only eligible background cells with 8.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid represents a 2D canvas with colors (integers 1-9 likely), where 0 is empty/undefined, 5 is a special blocker (e.g., walls or barriers), and other numbers are colored objects or background.
 * Side bars (vertical colored strips on left/right edges, extracted from row 1 at specific column ranges like 1-4, 7-10, etc.) provide protected colors that cannot be overwritten by 8; these bars indicate "object" colors that act as barriers.
 * Background color is the most common non-0, non-5 color in the working area (rows 6-24), used to identify what 8 can spread over; spreading only occurs on this background, not on other colors.
 * Spreading of 8 is a flood-fill-like process from initial seed 8s, propagating to orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) background cells, but not diagonally; connections must be contiguous, forming blobs that can grow vertically across rows and horizontally within rows.
 * Subtlety: Initial 8 seeds may be sparse or absent in some rows, but vertical adjacency allows spread from above/below rows, which the current approach misses entirely—leading to isolated horizontal spreads instead of full connected components.
 * Protected set includes all bar colors plus 5; do not spread into or over these, even if adjacent to background.
 * Grids are 24 columns wide; working area is rows 6-24 (19 rows outputted), but top/bottom rows may have partial spreads due to edge effects or no seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Spread does not overwrite existing non-background objects (e.g., small colored blobs like 1s, 2s, 4s, 6s); in expected outputs, these remain intact while surrounding background turns to 8 if connected.
 * Another subtlety: In some cases (e.g., train 3), spreads form complex L-shapes or partial fills around objects, suggesting barriers can create enclosed areas that only partially fill if seeds don't reach all parts.
 * No spreading outside the working area (rows 0-5 are UI/bars, ignored in output).
 * If no background is detected (all 0/5), no spread occurs, but this is rare.
 * Seeds (initial 8s) are part of the input grid and must be preserved/expanded from, not created anew.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies bar colors and background but fails to spread 8 vertically, only handling horizontal expansion per row, resulting in disconnected or over/under-filled blobs.
 * In training example 1: Generated fills entire top rows (0-2 of output) with background 3 instead of placing vertical 8 lines in columns 8-9 and 16-17 (as in expected); middle rows (e.g., output row 7-8) spread 8 fully horizontally from col 4-17 over 3, but expected has contained 8s only in specific columns without full row fill; bottom rows correctly preserve 2s and 4s but miss vertical extensions (e.g., output row 9-10 have full 8 in cols 4-17, but expected narrows to cols 4-5 and 8-9); unknown why top rows are uniformly 3 (perhaps initial grid had no seeds there, and no vertical propagation).
 * In training example 2: Generated spreads 8 only horizontally in rows 3-4 of output (cols 4-15 over bg 1), but expected shows vertical chains of 8s in cols 4-5, 8-9, 14-17, and 20-23, with partial fills (e.g., row 2 has full 8 in cols 13-23, but generated has all 1s); top rows (0-1) correctly preserve 6s but miss 8 extensions into cols 4-5 and 8-9; bottom rows preserve 4s correctly but no spread into them.
 * In training example 3: Generated spreads 8 horizontally in output row 11 (cols 3-19 over bg 7?), creating a full bar of 8, but expected has contained vertical 8s in cols 3-4 and 18-19, plus complex shapes (e.g., row 4 has full 8 in cols 0-7 and 16-19, but generated has all 7s); right side 6s are preserved but miss adjacent 8 fills; bottom rows correctly keep 4s but no vertical connection from above.
 * spread_row function is partially helpful for horizontal spread but broken/incomplete without vertical integration; it assumes independent rows, missing contiguous blobs across rows.
 * get_bar_colors and get_background are helpful and seem accurate (protected sets like {1,2,4,5} for train1 match patterns), but not sufficient alone.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of protection and bg detection but zero grasp of vertical flood-fill.
 * Overall, all training examples fail due to lack of vertical propagation, leading to mismatched blob shapes/sizes (e.g., expected blobs are taller/narrower, generated are wider/shorter or absent).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows horizontal-only spreading of 8 in output rows 7-9 (full from col 3 to 21 over presumed bg 9), but leaves top rows (0-2) as all 2s and rows 10-16 as 9s without any 8 penetration, suggesting no vertical spread from the middle 8 seeds upward or downward.
 * This mismatches likely expected behavior: Based on training patterns, 8 should propagate vertically to form connected columns or blobs (e.g., potentially filling cols 3-21 in more rows if bg-connected, or creating partial vertical lines around preserved 1s and bottom 4s); top 2s and widespread 9s remain untouched except horizontally in middle, but expected would likely have 8 extensions into row 3-6 (where 1s and 9s mix) and possibly bottom rows if adjacent to bg.
 * The uniform 2s in top rows and full 9s below indicate isolated horizontal fills, ignoring vertical adjacency—e.g., row 6 has 1s then 9s turning to 8 below, but no upward spread into row 5's 9s; this doesn't make sense for a connected flood puzzle, as seeds in row 7 should reach upward if bg=9 is eligible.
 * Bottom rows (17-18) preserve 4s correctly but show no 8 spread into surrounding 9s, unlike training where adjacent bg gets filled vertically; test likely needs vertical flood to handle the tall 9 block.

[2025-10-01 23:31:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 23:48:14] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers 0-9) where the goal is to apply transformation rules based on a "beam row" (likely row 1 after normalization) to fill specific regions with a maroon color (8 in original, 2 in normalized space), propagating vertically and horizontally while preserving other structures like panels and walls. The rules seem to derive from beam positions within 4-cell panel segments, triggering fills in adjacent positions based on beam colors (e.g., red=5, yellow=7) and panel indices, with the output being a modified 19-row grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Color normalization is essential: A fixed mapping (e.g., 0->8 green to background, 8->2 for maroon handling) standardizes colors across inputs, but the inverse (denormalizing 2 back to 8) must be applied only to new fills, not existing elements, to avoid overwriting originals.
 * Grid structure: Inputs have at least 25 rows; output is bottom 19 rows (rows 6:25 0-indexed), suggesting top rows are metadata or beams; walls are 6, empty/background is 0 or 8 post-normalization, beams appear in 4-cell panel slots (positions 0-3 relative to start).
 * Beam extraction: Scan row 1 for non-wall segments of 4 cells; identify beam position (first non-6/8 cell) and color; panels seem indexed (e.g., start=1 for panel1, start=7 for panel2, etc.), with rules conditional on exact start positions (1,7,13,19) and beam colors (e.g., 5=red triggers fills in pos3-4 or pos1-2).
 * Fill rules: Vertical fills in upper 7 rows (rows 0-6 of output) target columns with 0/8, using maroon (2); horizontal spread from 2's fills adjacent 0/8 in the same row; lower fills (rows 7+) only on exact 0's in fill columns, no spreading mentioned but applied in code. Subtle: Fills are panel-specific (e.g., panel1 red fills pos3+, panel2 yellow fills pos2-3), and columns are uniqued to avoid overlaps.
 * Propagation subtleties: Horizontal fill spreads left/right from seeds but skips non-0/8 (e.g., doesn't overwrite 1's or 7's); vertical upper allows 0/8, lower only 0, suggesting upper tolerates green background but lower is stricter. Easy to miss: Fills don't propagate vertically beyond seeding columns; no diagonal or multi-row horizontal rules.
 * Denormalization issue: Only replace 2 with 8 at end, but if original had 2's (unlikely), it could corrupt; mapping assumes all colors are remapped, but beams/panels may need preservation.
 * Panel indexing: Starts at multiples of 4 +1? (e.g., 1,7=4*1+3?,13=4*3+1,19=4*4+3), but code hardcodes; walls (6) separate panels, beams not always present.
 * Overall: Rules aim to "activate" paths or barriers based on beam signals, creating connected maroon regions without altering non-empty cells; outputs show patterned fills (e.g., horizontal bars of 3/4 in expected, vertical strips of 8).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def mapping_normalize(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Apply the fixed color mapping to standardize the grid colors."""
    mapping = {0: 8, 1: 1, 2: 5, 3: 0, 4: 7, 5: 6, 6: 9, 7: 4, 8: 2, 9: 3}
    return [[mapping.get(cell, cell) for cell in row] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for consistent color handling; note potential error in mapping as outputs show mismatches like 3->3 but expected varies.)

```python
def extract_beam_config(g_norm: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Extract beam positions and colors from the normalized beam row (row 1, 0-indexed)."""
    beam_row = g_norm[1]
    panels = []
    i = 0
    n = len(beam_row)
    while i < n:
        if beam_row[i] == 6:  # wall
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        beam_pos = -1
        beam_color = 0
        for j in range(4):
            if i + j >= n:
                break
            if beam_row[i + j] != 8 and beam_row[i + j] != 6:
                beam_pos = j
                beam_color = beam_row[i + j]
                break
        if beam_pos != -1:
            panels.append((start, beam_pos, beam_color))
        i += 4
    return panels
```
(This correctly identifies panels and beams but assumes fixed 4-cell width; helpful for rule triggering, but misses cases with no beam.)

```python
def horizontal_fill_regions(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Perform horizontal fill of 0 and 8 (green) connected to 2's in each row."""
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        row = grid[r]
        new_row = row[:]
        i = 0
        n = len(row)
        while i < n:
            if row[i] != 2:
                i += 1
                continue
            # spread left
            j = i
            while j > 0 and row[j - 1] in (0, 8):
                new_row[j - 1] = 2
                j -= 1
            # spread right
            j = i
            while j < n - 1 and row[j + 1] in (0, 8):
                new_row[j + 1] = 2
                j += 1
            i = j + 1
        grid[r] = new_row
    return grid
```
(This implements row-wise spreading accurately but only from 2 seeds; useful for connecting fills horizontally without overwriting obstacles.)

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `determine_fill_columns`: Hardcoded conditions (e.g., only specific starts/colors like start=7 color=7/9) miss general rules; outputs wrong columns (e.g., overfills or underfills panels), leading to incorrect seeding.
- `fill_vertical_upper` and `fill_lower_vertical`: Upper fills 0/8 in top 7 rows (good), but lower only from row 7 on 0's (misses if background is 8); doesn't propagate vertically, which may be correct but fails to match expected connected regions.
- `copy_bottom_19`: Assumes exactly 25+ rows and slices 6:25; helpful for cropping but rigid if inputs vary.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, with generated outputs showing incorrect fills (e.g., full rows of 8 in train1 rows 0-2 where expected has patterned 3's and 8's; overfilled 1's and 9's in train2 where expected has 8's and 6's in specific positions).
 * Train1: Generated full maroon (8) strips in upper rows and mismatched lower patterns (e.g., 7's in cols 18-21 where expected 4's; 0's unfilled where expected 3's); horizontal spread over-applied, filling entire rows instead of bounded regions; missed replacing with 3 (light blue?) in many areas.
 * Train2: Generated mostly 1's with misplaced 9's and 8's, but expected shows 8's in panel gaps, 6's in beams, and 2/3/4 fills; vertical fills absent, no horizontal bars of 4/6; beam extraction likely failed to trigger correct columns (e.g., no 8's in row2-3).
 * Train3: Generated uniform 4's and 9's with partial 8's, but expected has 7/8/3/6 patterns and 2/4 fills; overfilled right side with 9's where expected 6's; horizontal fill didn't create the expected 8-bar in mid-rows.
 * Mapping_normalize may have errors (e.g., 3->0 but expected keeps 3's; 2->5 but maroon is 8); denormalization only swaps 2->8 but doesn't handle other normalized colors back correctly.
 * extract_beam_config is essential but incomplete: Detects beams well but determine_fill_columns uses brittle ifs (e.g., only pos==0 or 3, specific starts), missing rules for pos=1/2 or other colors; doesn't handle no-beam panels.
 * horizontal_fill_regions works for spreading but applied too early/late, causing bleed into non-fill areas (e.g., train1 row3 has 1's overwritten indirectly).
 * Overall, attempts understand normalization and extraction basics but fail on rule logic (wrong columns/seeds) and propagation (no vertical spread, incomplete horizontal bounds); unhelpful: Hardcoded panel rules ignore general patterns like beam color signaling adjacent fills regardless of exact start.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows large blocks of uniform 5's (rows 0-2, possibly orange) and 3's (rows 3-6+), with partial 8's in row7-8 cols8-10 and 7's in row17-18 cols7-15, but ends abruptly with 0's in right columns; this suggests overfilling upper areas without bounds and missing horizontal/vertical connections (e.g., no spreading from 8's to create bars like in train expected).
 * Compared to training expectations, it lacks patterned fills (e.g., no 8-verticals connecting to horizontals; 3's dominate where 8's or other colors should propagate); right-side 0's unfilled, unlike expected 3/4/6 in trains.
 * Likely incorrect because beam rules weren't triggered properly (e.g., if test beam row has colors not matching hardcodes like 7/5, no fills occur); output has isolated 8's without spread, and lower 7's don't align with panel gaps; doesn't make sense as a "transformed" grid—too blocky/uniform vs. expected structured paths.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Execution error: list index out of range

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: list index out of range
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

[2025-10-02 00:08:09] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle on a 24x24 matrix where the goal is to transform an input grid by identifying a background color, clearing and filling parts of the grid, shifting non-background blocks upward, and then extending and connecting blocks with a fill color (likely 8) to form structured patterns, possibly representing connected shapes or pathways. The transformations aim to "normalize" or "complete" fragmented blocks into cohesive forms, but the exact rules involve specific vertical/horizontal extensions and connections that must align precisely with expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is consistent and can be reliably extracted from fixed positions like row 6, column 0, but must be applied correctly to avoid overwriting valid blocks.
 * Top rows (first 6) are cleared to background to remove initial walls or artifacts, but this must not affect lower structures prematurely.
 * Empty spaces (0s) are filled with color 8 globally, but subsequent shifts and extensions treat 8 as a special "connector" that can be extended vertically (up to row 0 and down until hitting non-background/non-fill) and horizontally (extending blocks by 2 columns, filling small gaps <=4 wide in connection rows).
 * Blocks (non-background) are shifted up by a fixed amount (6 rows) per column, preserving contiguous same-color runs but clipping to the top and filling old positions with background; this must handle multiple runs per column without merging unrelated colors.
 * Vertical extensions for fill (8) merge ranges within a column and extend only through background, stopping at other colors; subtle: down-extension stops at non-background non-fill, but up-extension only if background.
 * Horizontal connections occur only in rows with at least two consecutive 8s, extending non-background blocks right by 2 (clipped), then filling gaps <=4 between them with 8, but only if background; this creates "bridges" but over-applies if rows are misidentified.
 * Lower connections involve identifying the bottom-most non-background row, adding full horizontal 8 fills from column 4 to 23 at that row-1 (and possibly row-2), plus targeted vertical fills in specific left columns (e.g., 4,5,8,9) down to the bottom; subtle: this seems puzzle-specific to certain shapes and may not generalize.
 * Errors like "list index out of range" likely stem from unhandled edge cases in loops (e.g., i +=1 exceeding 24 in shift_single_column or extend_fill_vertical when processing runs), especially if input grids have irregular block placements or no blocks in some columns.
 * Expected outputs show patterned connections with 8s forming "frames" or "paths" around colored blocks (e.g., 1s,2s,3s,4s,6s), with precise gaps and no overfilling; generated outputs often overfill with 8s or 3s/background, merge unrelated blocks, or fail to create exact gap patterns (e.g., expected has isolated 8 pairs like columns 8-9 and 16-17 in train1 row0, but generated fills entire sections).
 * Subtle: Shifts must preserve original colors without changing them to fill; connections don't overwrite existing non-background colors, only background.
 * Puzzle may involve symmetry or specific column starts (e.g., from col 4), and bottom blocks (like 2s in train1) remain unshifted if already low.
 * All operations compose sequentially, so order matters: clear/fill before shift, shift before extensions, upper connections before lower to avoid interfering with bottom fills.
 * Grids are 24x24, rows 0=top to 23=bottom; clipping must prevent index errors by using min/max.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented a sequential pipeline (clear top, fill 0s with 8, shift up by 6, vertical 8 extensions, upper horizontal connections, lower connections) but produced incorrect outputs for train1 and train2, with overfilling of 8s (e.g., train1 generated full rows of 3s/8s in top/mid where expected has sparse 8 pairs and gaps) and failure to preserve exact block positions/colors (e.g., 1s blocks extended wrongly, 4s not isolated properly).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated has solid 8 bands across columns 4-11 and 16-23 in rows 4-11, but expected has targeted 8s in cols 8-9/16-17 with 3s filling gaps elsewhere; bottom 2s correct but upper connections over-extend left 1s into 8s instead of keeping 3s; unknown why shift placed 1s starting at row3 instead of row3 with partial 8 integration.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated shifts 6s and 1s incorrectly (e.g., row0 has full 8s in cols8-12/18-19 but expected has sparse 8s with 1s/6s interrupting); lower 4s not connected properly, and mid 8s overfill across cols4-21 in rows5-10 where expected has gaps with 1s; 2s and 3s positions off due to faulty column shifts.
 * Train3 and test errors: "list index out of range" likely from shift_single_column or extend_fill_vertical where i exceeds 23 in while loops (e.g., if a run ends at i=23, inner while pushes i=24); indicates poor boundary handling in run-length encoding.
 * add_upper_connections over-applies extensions (extends by 2 right unconditionally, fills gaps <=4 even if not needed, leading to merged blobs); not subtle enough for sparse expected patterns.
 * add_lower_connections is too rigid (hardcodes cols 4,5,8,9 for vertical fills and row bottom_start-1/-2 for horizontals), works for train1 bottom but fails generalization (e.g., train2 bottom at row17 with 4s not matching); unhelpful for variable bottoms.
 * extend_fill_vertical merges all 8 ranges per column into one overall min/max, but over-extends down (fills through non-b in some cases); subtle bug: doesn't stop down-extension at non-8 non-b correctly in all scenarios.
 * shift_blocks_up uses fixed amount=6, which works for some but may not for varying block heights; preserves runs but clips poorly if new_start negative.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of core sequence (clear/shift/connect) but misses precision in connections (too aggressive filling) and error-prone loops; get_background, clear_top, fill_empties, and shift_single_column (fixed) are helpful, but add_upper/lower_connections and extend_fill_vertical are broken/overly specific (avoid or refactor).

**Test output:**
 * No generated test output provided (only ERROR: list index out of range), so cannot visually assess; error suggests same boundary issue as train3, meaning the program crashes before producing output, indicating it doesn't handle the test input's grid structure (possibly empty columns, all-background rows, or blocks at edges causing loop overflows).
 * Without test grid, cannot mentally simulate exact output, but based on patterns in trains, expected test likely involves similar 8 connections around shifted colored blocks (e.g., isolating shapes like 1s/4s with 8 paths from col4+); current attempt would fail due to crash, so output doesn't make sense—must fix indices first (e.g., add i < 24 checks in all whiles).
 * Test likely tests generalization (e.g., different background, variable shift needs, or no top clear needed), so over-reliance on fixed amount=6 or col4 starts would mismatch; ensure no overfill like in trains.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 00:08:09] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 24-column grid (likely 19 rows shown in outputs) where colored bars (extracted from the second row of the input grid) define protected zones, and sequences of 8's (representing a spreading "ink" or "flood" element) expand horizontally within their rows only under a specific merge condition (if bar 2 or 3 is color 6), stopping at protected colors or edges, while leaving other numbers (like 1,2,3,4, etc.) intact unless overwritten by the spread.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid g is a List[List[int]] with at least 25 rows (indices 0-24), but the output focuses on rows 6-24 (19 rows), copying them initially and modifying only where 8's are present.
 * Bar colors (1-4) are extracted from specific segments of row 1 (indices 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22), taking the first non-zero value in each; these bars act as blockers for spreading, along with color 5 (a universal protector, possibly a special barrier).
 * Spreading only activates if has_merge is true (bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6), indicating a "merge" event that allows 8's to propagate; without this, the grid is returned unchanged.
 * When spreading in a row with 8's: identify contiguous sequences of 8's, then expand left from the start and right from the end, overwriting non-protected cells (anything not in {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5}) until hitting a protected cell or edge; this must be done per row independently, and only affects rows containing at least one 8.
 * Subtlety: Spreading does not cross protected cells, even if they are not bars (e.g., stops at existing 1's or other numbers if they match protected set); it also doesn't spread vertically—only horizontal per row.
 * Easy to miss: The protected set is dynamic per puzzle (based on bars), and 0's in row 1 are ignored for bar extraction; spreading overwrites blanks or other fillable cells but preserves protected ones; in some cases, 8's appear to "connect" across gaps only if unprotected.
 * Other considerations: Grids have repeating rows (e.g., three identical rows of bars or fillers), suggesting vertical stacking or patterns; numbers like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 represent distinct colors/objects that shouldn't be altered unless spread into; the puzzle may involve "ink" filling regions bounded by bars, but only triggers on merge.
 * From examples: Spreading creates "blobs" of 8's that respect bar boundaries (e.g., in ex1, 8's fill between bars but stop at 1's/4's if protected); non-merge cases might do nothing; test input has 9's as a new color, possibly a bar or filler, and partial 8's that should spread if merge applies.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bar_colors(g):
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next(c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0)
    bar2 = next(c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0)
    bar3 = next(c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0)
    bar4 = next(c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts bar colors correctly from fixed positions in row 1, ignoring 0's; useful for defining protectors.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2, bar3):
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(This checks the merge condition accurately; essential to gate the spreading logic, as non-merge outputs should be unchanged.)

(The main program structure—copying rows 6:25, checking merge, defining protected set, and iterating rows for spreading—is a good skeleton, but the spreading implementation is flawed as detailed below. No types like classes are used, but a protected set is helpful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and extracts bar colors via get_bar_colors, which matches the positional logic seen in examples (e.g., bars at columns 1-4,7-10,etc., with non-zero first value).
 * has_merge works as a trigger, preventing changes in non-merge cases (though all examples seem to be merge cases).
 * The protected set {bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, 5} is a good idea, capturing blockers like bars and a special 5.
 * However, spreading logic is broken: it over-spreads 8's across entire rows or sections, ignoring actual protected cells in the row (e.g., in train1, it fills huge swaths with 8's and even changes non-8 areas to 3's incorrectly, instead of stopping at existing 1's/4's; expected has isolated 8 pairs like positions 8-9 and 16-17).
 * In train1: Generated has full rows of 3's at top and massive 8 blocks in rows 7-8, but expected has targeted 8's (e.g., rows 0-2: 8's only at cols 8-9,16-17; row 9: 8's at 4-5,8-9 but stops before protected 3's/4's); difference is over-filling and wrong base colors (3's where 8's shouldn't go).
 * In train2: Generated spreads 8's too far in rows 8-9 (full blocks), but expected has more precise 8's (e.g., row 0: 8's at 4-5,8-9; row 2: wide 8's from col 13-21 but starting from existing); also fails to spread into some gaps (e.g., row 4 has no 8's in generated but expected has them); introduces wrong 1's in bar areas.
 * In train3: Generated incorrectly fills with 7's in early rows and over-spreads 8's in row 11-12, but expected has 8's integrated with 7's as blockers (e.g., row 0: 8's at 3-4,18-19; row 4: full 8's but stopping at 7's); misses connecting 8's across minor gaps while respecting 7/6 bars.
 * Overall: Attempt demonstrates understanding of bars, merge, and horizontal spreading concept, but fails on precise boundary detection (spreads past existing protected numbers like 1/3/4/6/7 if they match set but doesn't check per-cell in row); the while loops for left/right spread use row[] for checks but new_row for writes, causing overwrite issues or skipping; no handling for multiple 8 sequences per row properly.
 * get_bar_colors and has_merge are helpful and correct—keep them; the spreading loop is unhelpful/broken (over-aggressive, doesn't preserve non-8 non-protected cells correctly, and mutates incorrectly)—avoid reusing as-is.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It mostly copies the input with minimal changes (e.g., rows 0-2 full of 2's unchanged; rows 3-6 full 9's; only partial 8's in row 7 at cols 8-10, but no spreading despite likely merge), resulting in isolated 8's and untouched 9's/4's, which mismatches the pattern of controlled 8 expansion seen in training expecteds (e.g., should spread 8's left/right from row 7's position 8-10 into adjacent 9's if unprotected, potentially filling between bars like cols 4-11 or similar, stopping at 1's or extracted bars; instead, it leaves most 9's intact and doesn't propagate, suggesting the merge check passed but spreading failed to activate/execute properly).
 * Differences: No wide 8 blobs as in training expecteds (e.g., expected likely has 8's expanding in rows 7+ to connect or fill regions bounded by 1's/9's/3's, especially row 17-18 where 4's are, possibly overwriting some 9's but not 1's/3's); the output feels like a near-copy with buggy partial 8 insert, missing the "flood" effect; 9's seem treated as non-protected but not filled, indicating the spread logic doesn't target them correctly.
 * To handle test: Ensure spreading checks every row with 8's (row 7 here), uses the correct protected set (bars likely 2/9/?/3 or similar from row 1, plus 5), and propagates only horizontally without altering non-8 rows; mentally, if bar2 or 3 is 6, 8's in row 7 should spread left to col 4 (stop at 1's?) and right to col 11 (stop at 9's if protected), creating a blob like [1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,...].

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the task is to overlay or insert a special color (8) to highlight or connect specific linear or banded patterns, likely representing outlines, borders, or extensions of existing colored regions across horizontal bands of similar rows. The goal is to transform the input grid by replacing background or gap cells with 8's in precise positions to form paired or extended lines, while preserving other colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid consists of horizontal "bands" of identical or near-identical rows, and processing must group these bands to identify patterns like runs of non-background colors.
 * 8's are placed specifically to form short pairs (e.g., two consecutive 8's) or extend existing lines, often adjacent to non-background runs of width <=4, but only in certain directions (e.g., right of left-side runs or left of right-side runs), and sometimes filling full horizontal segments in stacked bands.
 * Background color (most common cell value) must be ignored when detecting runs; runs are sequences of the same non-background color.
 * Subtlety: 8's often appear in positions that "bridge" or outline shapes across bands, such as vertical alignments (e.g., columns 8-9 and 16-17 in train 1), but not always full rows—e.g., in train 1 row 9, 8's are interrupted by 3's in specific columns.
 * Another subtlety: In stacked bands, 8's can propagate vertically or fill entire row segments if aligned (e.g., full 8 rows in train 1 rows 7-8), but only where patterns match across bands; isolated bands don't get full fills.
 * Placement rules seem tied to grid width (e.g., references to column 12 suggest a 24-column grid midpoint), with left-side runs (start <12) extending right, and right-side runs extending left, but only if width conditions are met and color != background.
 * Easy to miss: Existing 8's in input should be preserved or extended, but new 8's only replace background; overfilling (e.g., replacing non-background with 8's) breaks the output.
 * Vertical alignment is key—8's must match column positions across multiple rows in a band for consistency (e.g., train 2 has 8 pairs in columns 4-5, 8-9, 14-15).
 * Bands may have interruptions (e.g., train 1 row 9 has 8's with 3's in between), so run detection must handle non-uniform rows within a "band" of mostly similar rows.
 * No vertical processing in current code—puzzle likely requires checking alignments across bands, not just within rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty or short grids return empty; top 6 rows seem ignored (header?); color 8 has special handling (e.g., width >=2 triggers pairs).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for ignoring it in run detection.)

```python
def get_bands(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    bands = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        j = i
        while j < n and grid[j] == grid[i]:
            j += 1
        pattern = grid[i]
        runs = []
        k = 0
        m = len(pattern)
        while k < m:
            if pattern[k] == get_background(grid):
                k += 1
                continue
            color = pattern[k]
            start = k
            while k < m and pattern[k] == color:
                k += 1
            end = k - 1
            width = end - start + 1
            runs.append((start, end, color, width))
        bands.append((i, j - i, runs))
        i = j
    return bands
```
(This groups identical rows into bands and extracts non-background runs with positions and widths, useful for identifying candidate line positions; however, it assumes perfectly identical rows in bands, which may not hold if rows have minor variations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies background (3 in train 1, 1 in train 2, 7 in train 3) and groups rows into bands, which works for detecting horizontal patterns.
 * Run extraction in get_bands skips background and captures widths/colors, helpful for spotting short runs (<=4) that might need extension.
 * find_line_pairs attempts to detect positions for 8 pairs based on color 8 (width>=2) or short non-bg runs, adding adjacent positions (e.g., right of left runs), which partially aligns with pair placements but fails to propagate vertically or fill aligned segments.
 * In program, it copies the grid and only replaces bg with 8's in rows with detected pairs, using min/max columns to fill segments— this overfills horizontally (e.g., full 8's from col 4-20 in train 1 row 7) instead of precise pairs.
 * Train 1 generated: Overfilled rows 7-8 and 9 with continuous 8's in cols 4-17, ignoring interruptions (expected has pairs at 8-9,16-17 with 3's elsewhere; also missed upper pairs and lower extensions like row 12-15).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Rows 0-2 all 3's (correct, no change), but rows 3-6 should have pairs starting at row 3, not just lower; row 9 has full 8's instead of interrupted (8,8,3,3,8,8,3,3); rows 12-15 missed entirely (expected 8 pairs); bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 2 generated: Filled cols 4-15 with 8's in rows 7-8 and 10, but expected has pairs at specific columns (4-5,8-9,14-15) across more rows (e.g., rows 0-1,3-4,5-8,9-10); missed vertical extensions in row 2 (full 8's cols 14-21); row 14 has full 8's cols 8-21 (wrong, expected pairs).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Upper rows 0-1 have no 8's (expected pairs); row 2 all 1's (expected long 8's); rows 11-12 missed pairs; bottom unchanged (correct).
 * Train 3 generated: Filled cols 3-19 with 8's in rows 11-12, but expected has more distributed pairs (e.g., cols 3-4,13-14 in upper rows); rows 4-7 all 7's (missed 8 extensions); row 16 has 8's only in detected band (wrong positions).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Rows 0-2 have 3's unchanged (expected pairs at 3-4,18-19); rows 4-6 all 7's (expected full 8's cols 0-7,19-20); row 6 has partial (expected more); rows 13-15 missed pairs and full 8's; function assumes exact row equality for bands, but train 3 row 6 differs slightly from above.
 * Overall, program ignores vertical alignment across bands, leading to no propagation (e.g., no 8's in upper bands of train 1); line_pairs only adds single adjacent cells, not pairs or fills.
 * find_line_pairs is broken/not helpful: It adds (start, start+1) for color 8 width>=2 (but start is run start, so wrong positions); for other runs, adds single cells adjacent but not pairs, and only if start<12 or end>11 (midpoint logic partial but incomplete); doesn't handle full fills or interruptions.
 * get_bands is mostly helpful but skips bg in runs correctly; however, doesn't handle near-identical bands (e.g., if rows differ by 1 cell).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills large horizontal segments with 8's (e.g., rows 7-9 cols 3-20 full 8's, row 13 cols 3-20 full 9's unchanged but should likely get pairs) instead of precise pairs or aligned extensions, similar to training errors.
 * In test, top rows 0-2 all 2's (likely correct, no change); rows 3-5 all 9's (correct); row 6 has 1's in cols 0-2 then 9's (partial, but expected probably 8 pairs around the 1's); rows 7-9 overfilled with 8's across most cols (expected pairs like cols 3-4, perhaps 12-13 based on pattern); rows 10-12 1's then 9's (missed 8's); rows 13-15 full 9's in cols 3+ (wrong, likely need pairs); rows 16-17 all 9's (correct?); rows 18-20 have 4's in cols 7-15 (unchanged, but may need 8 outlines); bottom all 9's (correct). It ignores vertical patterns (e.g., the left 1's in rows 6-12 suggest a vertical shape needing 8 borders on right).
 * No vertical propagation: The 1's on left in rows 6-12 align vertically, likely needing 8 pairs to the right (e.g., cols 3-4), but output only fills in row 7-9 band; bottom 4's band unchanged despite being a distinct run.
 * Overfilling bg with 8's in detected bands, but test has bg=9 (most common), so runs of 2/1/4 should trigger specific pair placements, not full rows; misses potential full 8 rows if aligned across bands (none here, but code doesn't check).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), where the goal is to generate a modified version of a subgrid (rows 6-24) by spreading a special "ink" or filler (value 8) from initial seeds or patterns, influenced by background color detection, vertical bars with specific colors (like 6 indicating merges), and rules for expanding 8's into adjacent background cells while preserving other structures like colored blocks or bars.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a background color (most common value across the entire input grid), which 8's can spread into horizontally in affected rows, but only adjacent to existing 8's or seeds; spreading does not overwrite non-background cells (e.g., colored blocks like 1's, 3's, 4's, or bars).
 * Vertical bars (likely in fixed columns like 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22 based on code attempts) have colors that trigger rules: a bar color of 6 in bar2 or bar3 indicates a "merge" mode, which seeds additional 8's in specific column pairs across all output rows where the background is present.
 * Initial seeds for 8's come from finding consecutive 8's (length >=2) in the input subgrid rows; during merge, seed two adjacent columns (e.g., start and start+1 of the first such pair found) with 8's in all rows if those positions are background.
 * Spreading of 8's is horizontal only, expanding left/right from clusters of 8's into background, but only applied to rows that originally contain at least one 8 in the input; this can create filled horizontal bands or connect sections.
 * Subtleties: Merges create vertical "pillars" of 8's that then spread horizontally in subsequent rows; not all rows spread equally—some expected outputs show partial spreading (e.g., only left or right sides), and 8's can form large connected blobs vertically/horizontally but respect block boundaries. Bars and blocks (e.g., sequences of same color like 1's or 4's) must not be overwritten. In non-merge cases, spreading might be minimal or absent. Easy to miss: seed positions are column-based across all rows, but spreading is per-row; background detection uses the whole grid, including non-subgrid rows. Also, 8's in input might already be present, and spreading should chain (e.g., fill gaps between multiple 8 clusters in a row).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where initial pair is not found (return None, no seeding); spreading must skip over non-background (e.g., don't spread into a 4-block); vertical alignment of 8's from seeding must propagate spreading in lower rows; in merge, seeding happens before spreading, and only in background positions.

```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The main `program` function integrates the above but is broken: it seeds only if merge and pair found, but applies seeding by setting to 8 only if background (good), yet spreads only on rows with original 8's (misses seeded rows); also, out = copy of subgrid before seeding, so seeding adds 8's but spreading check uses original g, leading to incomplete propagation. Not helpful as-is—needs fixing for vertical seeding to trigger spreading in all rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core logic for seeding and spreading is incomplete or misapplied.
 * In Training 1 (background likely 3): Generated correctly copied subgrid and detected bars/background, and spread some 8's in rows with original 8's (e.g., positions 8-9 filled consistently), but failed to seed additional 8's in columns 16-17 for top rows (expected has 8,8 there, generated has 3,3); also missed left-spreading in rows like index 9-11 (generated [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,...] vs expected [1,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,8,8,...]) and full horizontal 8-band in rows 14-15 (generated partial 8,8 at 8-9, expected full 8's from 4-23). In bottom rows 16-18, no spreading issues as no 8's. Merge likely triggered (bar2/bar3=6?), but seeding used wrong pair or didn't apply vertically enough.
 * In Training 2 (background likely 1): Generated spread some 8's horizontally where original 8's present (e.g., row 5 has 8,8 at 8-9), and seeded nothing visibly, but expected shows seeding 8's at columns 4-5 and 8-9 early, plus a full 8-band in row 2 (positions 12-23), and left-spreading in row 4 (8's at 4-5,8-9,12-15?); generated missed vertical pillars (e.g., row 0 expected 8,8 at 4-5 but generated 1,1) and spreading in row 14 (expected full 8-band from 8-23, generated only 8,8 at 8-9). Merge triggered but initial pair detection failed or seeding didn't propagate spreading to non-original-8 rows.
 * In Training 3 (background likely 7): Generated spread 8's in some places (e.g., row 11 has full 8-band), but missed seeding 8's at columns 3-4 and 19-20 in top rows (expected 8,8 there vs generated 7,7); also incomplete vertical spreading (e.g., row 4 expected full 8-band from 0-13 vs generated partial 7's and 8,8 at 12-13); row 13 expected 8's at 3-4 and 12-13 with 6's preserved, but generated wrong. Bottom rows correct as no 8's. Merge triggered, but pair selection wrong (used existing 8's instead of specific merge positions).
 * extract_objects not present in attempts, but bar/background detection is essential and partially works; spread_row is helpful but broken for chaining full expansions and applying to seeded rows.
 * Common miss: Seeding doesn't trigger spreading in rows without original 8's; initial pair always picks first consecutive 8's, but expected suggests merge-specific positions (e.g., fixed columns or different pairs per example). Spreading doesn't handle vertical connections implicitly—needs per-row after seeding.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples. It shows heavy spreading of 8's in row 7 (full 8-band from 3-21?), but minimal elsewhere (e.g., top rows all 2's except bottom 3's, rows 3-5 all 9's, row 6 partial 1's then 9's, rows 8-10 full 8's but then back to 9's, row 16 full 9's, rows 17-18 partial 4's in middle). This mismatches expected behavior: if merge triggered (assuming bars include 6), we'd expect vertical 8-pillars seeding columns (e.g., 3-4 or similar) across all rows, then horizontal spreading into background (likely 9 or 2/3), creating more connected 8-regions (e.g., bands in top/mid rows like training); instead, it seems spreading only hit isolated rows, missing propagation (e.g., no 8's bleeding from row 7 to 6/8 fully, and bottom 4-block untouched but should spread if adjacent). No full bands in expected-like positions (e.g., row 14 in training 1/2), and abrupt shifts (e.g., row 6 has 1's at 0-2 then 9's, but row 7 jumps to 8's) suggest incomplete seeding or background misdetection. To handle test, need to apply spreading to ALL rows after seeding, not just original-8 rows, and possibly detect multiple seed pairs or fixed merge columns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely 25 rows total, but focusing on rows 6-24 for output) where the number 8 represents a spreading element (like ink or flood fill) that originates from initial pairs of adjacent 8's and expands horizontally in rows, while respecting "protected" areas defined by colored bars (non-zero values in specific bar positions) and the value 5. The spreading is conditional on a "merge" condition (when bar2 or bar3 is 6), and the goal is to simulate row-by-row evolution of the grid over 19 steps, avoiding overwriting protected cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses numbers as colors/states: 8 is the spreading agent that fills empty/unprotected spaces (likely 0's, though not explicitly shown); other numbers (1-9) are fixed colors or barriers that shouldn't be overwritten.
 * Bars are extracted from row 1 (g[1]), in fixed segments: bar1 (cols 1-4), bar2 (7-10), bar3 (13-16), bar4 (19-22), taking the first non-zero in each— these and 5 are protected from spreading.
 * Spreading only happens if there's a merge (bar2==6 or bar3==6); otherwise, output the original subgrid unchanged.
 * Initial 8-pair detection: Scan rows 6-24 for the first adjacent pair of 8's (positions i and i+1); this pair seeds spreading in subsequent rows if no existing 8's are present.
 * Spreading mechanic: In each row (starting from the row with the initial pair), if a row already has 8's, expand them left/right until hitting protected cells (bars or 5); if no 8's, place 8's at the initial pair positions (if unprotected). This is done sequentially for 19 output rows, but spreading seems cumulative or stateful across rows in some way (e.g., once spread in one row, it influences later rows).
 * Subtlety: Spreading is horizontal only, per row, but the simulation is over time (19 steps), so early rows may show initial seeds, while later rows show full expansion; however, the code treats it as independent per row with global initial pair.
 * Edge cases: Protected cells block spread but aren't overwritten; if initial pair positions are protected, don't place 8's there; bars can be 0 (no protection in that segment?); value 6 in bars triggers merge mode.
 * Rows are 24 elements long (0-indexed cols 0-23); output is exactly 19 rows (g[6:25] processed).
 * Potential misses: Spreading might need to propagate vertically or based on prior row states (code assumes independent rows); initial pair is global but applied per row without 8's; over-spreading into protected areas; missing right-side seeds in some examples (e.g., training 1 has initial 8's on right not detected); merge condition might enable bi-directional or full-grid spread.
 * Unclear: Exact input grid structure (full g not shown, but rows 6+ are the evolving part); what 0 represents (empty?); why some expected rows have sudden full 8 spreads (e.g., row 14 in training 1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    row = g[1]

    n = len(new_row)

        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i

            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(Expands existing 8-blocks left/right until protected; core spreading logic, but assumes input row already has 8's—doesn't handle seeding new 8's.)

The main `program` function orchestrates: computes bars/protected, checks merge, finds pair, then per row: if has 8's spread them, else seed pair if possible; outputs 19 rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; all three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding.
 * Worked: Correctly detects bars and protected set (including 5); implements horizontal spreading from existing 8's without overwriting protected; finds initial 8-pair and seeds it in rows without 8's; skips processing if no merge.
 * Didn't work: Spreading/seeding is too limited—applies initial pair globally to all non-8 rows without progression (e.g., doesn't simulate time-based growth from prior rows); over-spreads in some cases (e.g., training 1 row 7-8 fills entire middle with 8's, but expected has gaps); misses additional seeds (e.g., training 1 has right-side 8's at cols 16-17 not detected/spread initially); in non-merge? Wait, all examples seem to have merge but code assumes it.
 * Training 1 differences: Generated keeps initial 8's at cols 8-9 but misses right-side 8's (cols 16-17 in expected rows 0-6); row 8 spreads left to cols 4-7 (3's become 8's) but expected keeps them as 3's until later; row 9 reverts to 3's instead of keeping partial 8's (expected has 8's at 4-5 and 8-9); row 14 has no spread (all 3's) vs expected full 8's cols 4-21; bottom rows match (2's appear correctly, likely from input).
 * Training 2 differences: No initial spread to cols 4-5 (expected has 8's there from row 0); row 2 clears middle 8's too early (expected keeps and spreads right to cols 13-21); row 4 has no right spread (expected full 8's cols 13-21); row 10 reverts middle without left 8's (expected has 8's at 4-5); row 14 spreads bottom but misses full 8's in middle (expected cols 8-21); function assumes single pair but example has multiple seed areas.
 * Training 3 differences: Misses initial left 8's at cols 3-4 (expected from row 0); row 4 spreads too much left (fills cols 0-7 with 7's? Wait, generated has 7's but expected 8's); row 6 keeps partial but expected full 8's cols 0-11; row 11 over-spreads to full 8's cols 3-19 but expected only around seeds; row 14 misses right spread (expected 8's at 18-19); row 15 changes right to 7's too early vs expected 8's persisting.
 * `get_initial_pair` is helpful but broken for multiple pairs (returns only first, misses right-side in train1/2); `spread_row` is useful but doesn't handle seeding or vertical influence; main loop processes rows independently without state carryover (likely why spreads don't progress cumulatively).
 * No unhelpful functions— all provided are relevant, but `get_initial_pair` needs enhancement for all seeds.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows minimal 8's (only in rows 7-8 at cols 8-10, from apparent seed) and over-relies on input colors (lots of 2's top, 9's middle/bottom, 4's late), but spreading seems absent or blocked entirely after initial, with no progression (e.g., rows 0-2 all 2's, then sudden 9's in row 3 without transition; row 7 has partial 8's but row 10 reverts to 9's; row 17 has 4's starting at col 7 but no 8 integration). This mismatches puzzle expectation of gradual 8-spread if merge is true (assuming bars include 6 somewhere, not shown); likely misses detecting/handling initial pair (possibly at cols 8-9 based on 8's placement) and full horizontal expansion around it, plus no cumulative effect across rows (e.g., 8's should fill more of the 9's area over time). Without full input grid, hard to confirm exact expected, but patterns from training suggest more 8-filling in middle rows (e.g., around cols 4-20) before late 4's/9's dominate; current output feels static/input-copying rather than simulated evolution.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 24x24 grid where non-background components from rows 6+ are translated upward by 6 rows to form a new structure at the top, while adding structural "maroon" elements (color 8) as beams, pillars, and anchors based on the position and gaps around a key maroon bounding box; the background color fills the rest, and lower sections may include additional beams or translated elements depending on bottom components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected groups of the same color (4-directional adjacency), ignoring colors 0 and 5 (likely empty or invalid); only consider components starting from row 6 downward to avoid upper grid noise.
 * Background is the largest component by pixel count; exclude it and color 8 (maroon/structural) from translation, but only translate components with 24-63 pixels (suggesting rectangular or mid-sized objects; smaller/larger may be ignored or treated differently).
 * Maroon (8) acts as an "anchor" – compute its bounding box (bbox) only in rows 6+; shift it up by 6 rows, then derive "beams" by finding the leftmost/rightmost gaps (empty background columns) adjacent to the anchor's columns at the anchor's shifted row height.
 * Beams (horizontal 8's) fill from beam_left to beam_right across the anchor's shifted row range; upper pillars (vertical 8's) extend beams downward from fixed starts (e.g., columns 8 and 16 if anchor_slot==2, else beam edges), always placing as support even over other colors.
 * Lower pillars extend from beam ends and anchor base downward to row 23, only overwriting background (not other colors).
 * Lower beam: Placed one row above the highest row of the bottommost translated component; its extent varies by anchor_slot (e.g., full width if slot==2 and relative3==1, else to anchor max_c); only overwrite background.
 * Top bars: Uniform color columns in rows 1-4 (excluding 0,5) may indicate slots or relative positions (e.g., bars[2]-12 for relative3); anchor_slot = min_c // 6 (likely 0-3 for positioning logic).
 * Subtle: Pillars/beams can overwrite translated components in some cases (upper always, lower only bg); bottom component is the one with max row in cells (after shift); if no translated, default bg=3 but this may not trigger.
 * Edge cases: Anchor may not span full height/width; beams/pillars widths are fixed (e.g., pillar_width=2) or derived (anchor_width); relative3 uses top bars (assumes 4 bars); test inputs may have varying bg (e.g., 3,1,7) and need to preserve non-8 translations accurately.
 * Potential misses: Overwriting non-bg in lower areas blocks pillar extension; incorrect beam_left/right if no gap (defaults to 0/23); lower beam row calc (bottom_min_r -1) may go negative/out-of-bounds; components <24 or >63 pixels ignored (e.g., small debris or large bg-like); top bars assume exactly 4, else relative3=1 (may fail if fewer bars).

 * Train 1: Generated extra 8's in upper-left (cols 4-5, rows 0-2/12-23) where expected has bg (3); missed full 8 beam in row 14 (cols 4-23); no 2's in rows 16-18 (expected bottom translated?); lower pillars/beam incomplete or wrong extent; translated 1's and 4's mostly correct but beams overwrite incorrectly.
 * Train 1: Top bars and relative3 logic placed pillars wrong (e.g., left_upper_start=8 but generated starts at 4); beam_left/right miscalc (used shifted_min_r=7? leading to left_trans_right wrong); lower beam row wrong (placed at row 11? but expected none, instead full 8's lower).
 * Train 2: Generated bg=1 correctly but filled lower rows (12-23) entirely with 1's/bg where expected has 8 beams (rows 14-15 cols 8-23), 4's (rows 16-18 cols 5-13), and 6's (rows 0-2 cols 13-17); missed translating/preserving 6's and 4's properly; pillars/beams only in upper, no lower extension; top bars logic failed (bars likely at cols 4,14? but relative3 wrong).
 * Train 2: Bottom component (likely 4's) not used for lower beam (expected row 15 full 8's); beam_left/right calc ignored gaps around anchor (min_c~8?); overwrote nothing in lower, leaving all bg.
 * Train 3: Generated mismatched top (7's instead of 3's in cols 8-17 rows 0-2); extra 8's in row 4 cols 0-3/20-23; wrong pillar widths (e.g., row 6 cols 3-7 as 8's but expected 7's); missed full 8's in row 4 cols 0-23?; bottom 4's in rows 16-18 cols 8-21 correct but surrounding 7's wrong; 6's translated but pillar overwrite incomplete.
 * Train 3: Bg=7 correct, but anchor bbox miscalc (min_c~0? leading to slot=0, wrong upper starts); relative3 from bars wrong (bars at 8,18?); lower beam not placed (expected none, but generated partial); function get_maroon_bbox scans correctly but beam fill uses wrong r_anchor.
 * Overall: Translation of non-8 components works partially (positions/sizes ok in upper), but beam/pillar placement fails due to incorrect gap detection (left_trans_right/right_trans_left often defaults wrong); lower logic (pillars only on bg, beam extent by slot/relative3) inconsistent; size filter 24-63 may exclude key elements (e.g., Train 2's 6's or 4's?); top bars assume 4 but may vary.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but get_top_bars assumes uniform rows 1-4 (may miss if not uniform); beam calc in program() fragile (uses single r_anchor, may miss if anchor not uniform height; left_trans_right scans only left of min_c but may find wrong edge if multiple components).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have translated components upward (e.g., 9's from lower to rows 3-5/13-23, 1's to rows 6-10/11-12, 3's as bg in cols 21-23), and placed some 8 pillars/beams (cols 3-4 throughout, row 7 cols 5-19 as 8's), but inconsistencies suggest errors: upper rows 0-2 have 2's in cols 0-2/5-19 where likely bg or different translation expected (2's may be unfiltered small component); row 5 has mixed 8's and 9's breaking beam continuity; lower rows 13-23 have 9's overwriting potential pillars (e.g., cols 5-20 should be 8's if lower pillars extend, but 9's persist); no clear lower beam (e.g., above bottom 9's at row 23, expected row 22 full 8's?); right side cols 19-20 have 8's but then 3's abruptly, suggesting wrong beam_right (gap detection failed around anchor min_c~?); overall, lacks full structural support (beams/pillars not spanning anchor bbox properly), and 3's in lower-right may be bg but positioned as if untranslated debris; does not match puzzle rules as beams/pillars seem partial/underfilled, and small 2's/3's suggest size filter or component detection missed filtering.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers 0-9) where the goal is to apply transformation rules based on a "beam row" (likely row 1 after normalization) to fill specific regions with a maroon color (8 in original, 2 in normalized space), propagating vertically and horizontally while preserving other structures like panels and walls. The rules seem to derive from beam positions within 4-cell panel segments, triggering fills in adjacent positions based on beam colors (e.g., red=5, yellow=7) and panel indices, with the output being a modified 19-row grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Color normalization is essential: A fixed mapping (e.g., 0->8 green to background, 8->2 for maroon handling) standardizes colors across inputs, but the inverse (denormalizing 2 back to 8) must be applied only to new fills, not existing elements, to avoid overwriting originals.
 * Grid structure: Inputs have at least 25 rows; output is bottom 19 rows (rows 6:25 0-indexed), suggesting top rows are metadata or beams; walls are 6, empty/background is 0 or 8 post-normalization, beams appear in 4-cell panel slots (positions 0-3 relative to start).
 * Beam extraction: Scan row 1 for non-wall segments of 4 cells; identify beam position (first non-6/8 cell) and color; panels seem indexed (e.g., start=1 for panel1, start=7 for panel2, etc.), with rules conditional on exact start positions (1,7,13,19) and beam colors (e.g., 5=red triggers fills in pos3-4 or pos1-2).
 * Fill rules: Vertical fills in upper 7 rows (rows 0-6 of output) target columns with 0/8, using maroon (2); horizontal spread from 2's fills adjacent 0/8 in the same row; lower fills (rows 7+) only on exact 0's in fill columns, no spreading mentioned but applied in code. Subtle: Fills are panel-specific (e.g., panel1 red fills pos3+, panel2 yellow fills pos2-3), and columns are uniqued to avoid overlaps.
 * Propagation subtleties: Horizontal fill spreads left/right from seeds but skips non-0/8 (e.g., doesn't overwrite 1's or 7's); vertical upper allows 0/8, lower only 0, suggesting upper tolerates green background but lower is stricter. Easy to miss: Fills don't propagate vertically beyond seeding columns; no diagonal or multi-row horizontal rules.
 * Denormalization issue: Only replace 2 with 8 at end, but if original had 2's (unlikely), it could corrupt; mapping assumes all colors are remapped, but beams/panels may need preservation.
 * Panel indexing: Starts at multiples of 4 +1? (e.g., 1,7=4*1+3?,13=4*3+1,19=4*4+3), but code hardcodes; walls (6) separate panels, beams not always present.
 * Overall: Rules aim to "activate" paths or barriers based on beam signals, creating connected maroon regions without altering non-empty cells; outputs show patterned fills (e.g., horizontal bars of 3/4 in expected, vertical strips of 8).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    return [[mapping.get(cell, cell) for cell in row] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for consistent color handling; note potential error in mapping as outputs show mismatches like 3->3 but expected varies.)

    panels = []
    i = 0
    n = len(beam_row)
    while i < n:
        if beam_row[i] == 6:  # wall
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        beam_pos = -1
        beam_color = 0
        for j in range(4):
            if i + j >= n:
                break
            if beam_row[i + j] != 8 and beam_row[i + j] != 6:
                beam_pos = j
                beam_color = beam_row[i + j]
                break

            panels.append((start, beam_pos, beam_color))
        i += 4
    return panels
```
(This correctly identifies panels and beams but assumes fixed 4-cell width; helpful for rule triggering, but misses cases with no beam.)

                continue
            # spread left
            j = i
            while j > 0 and row[j - 1] in (0, 8):
                new_row[j - 1] = 2

                j += 1
            i = j + 1
        grid[r] = new_row
    return grid
```
(This implements row-wise spreading accurately but only from 2 seeds; useful for connecting fills horizontally without overwriting obstacles.)

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `determine_fill_columns`: Hardcoded conditions (e.g., only specific starts/colors like start=7 color=7/9) miss general rules; outputs wrong columns (e.g., overfills or underfills panels), leading to incorrect seeding.
- `fill_vertical_upper` and `fill_lower_vertical`: Upper fills 0/8 in top 7 rows (good), but lower only from row 7 on 0's (misses if background is 8); doesn't propagate vertically, which may be correct but fails to match expected connected regions.
- `copy_bottom_19`: Assumes exactly 25+ rows and slices 6:25; helpful for cropping but rigid if inputs vary.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, with generated outputs showing incorrect fills (e.g., full rows of 8 in train1 rows 0-2 where expected has patterned 3's and 8's; overfilled 1's and 9's in train2 where expected has 8's and 6's in specific positions).
 * Train1: Generated full maroon (8) strips in upper rows and mismatched lower patterns (e.g., 7's in cols 18-21 where expected 4's; 0's unfilled where expected 3's); horizontal spread over-applied, filling entire rows instead of bounded regions; missed replacing with 3 (light blue?) in many areas.
 * Train2: Generated mostly 1's with misplaced 9's and 8's, but expected shows 8's in panel gaps, 6's in beams, and 2/3/4 fills; vertical fills absent, no horizontal bars of 4/6; beam extraction likely failed to trigger correct columns (e.g., no 8's in row2-3).
 * Train3: Generated uniform 4's and 9's with partial 8's, but expected has 7/8/3/6 patterns and 2/4 fills; overfilled right side with 9's where expected 6's; horizontal fill didn't create the expected 8-bar in mid-rows.
 * Mapping_normalize may have errors (e.g., 3->0 but expected keeps 3's; 2->5 but maroon is 8); denormalization only swaps 2->8 but doesn't handle other normalized colors back correctly.
 * extract_beam_config is essential but incomplete: Detects beams well but determine_fill_columns uses brittle ifs (e.g., only pos==0 or 3, specific starts), missing rules for pos=1/2 or other colors; doesn't handle no-beam panels.
 * horizontal_fill_regions works for spreading but applied too early/late, causing bleed into non-fill areas (e.g., train1 row3 has 1's overwritten indirectly).
 * Overall, attempts understand normalization and extraction basics but fail on rule logic (wrong columns/seeds) and propagation (no vertical spread, incomplete horizontal bounds); unhelpful: Hardcoded panel rules ignore general patterns like beam color signaling adjacent fills regardless of exact start.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows large blocks of uniform 5's (rows 0-2, possibly orange) and 3's (rows 3-6+), with partial 8's in row7-8 cols8-10 and 7's in row17-18 cols7-15, but ends abruptly with 0's in right columns; this suggests overfilling upper areas without bounds and missing horizontal/vertical connections (e.g., no spreading from 8's to create bars like in train expected).
 * Compared to training expectations, it lacks patterned fills (e.g., no 8-verticals connecting to horizontals; 3's dominate where 8's or other colors should propagate); right-side 0's unfilled, unlike expected 3/4/6 in trains.
 * Likely incorrect because beam rules weren't triggered properly (e.g., if test beam row has colors not matching hardcodes like 7/5, no fills occur); output has isolated 8's without spread, and lower 7's don't align with panel gaps; doesn't make sense as a "transformed" grid—too blocky/uniform vs. expected structured paths.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle on a 24x24 matrix where the goal is to transform an input grid by identifying a background color, clearing and filling parts of the grid, shifting non-background blocks upward, and then extending and connecting blocks with a fill color (likely 8) to form structured patterns, possibly representing connected shapes or pathways. The transformations aim to "normalize" or "complete" fragmented blocks into cohesive forms, but the exact rules involve specific vertical/horizontal extensions and connections that must align precisely with expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is consistent and can be reliably extracted from fixed positions like row 6, column 0, but must be applied correctly to avoid overwriting valid blocks.
 * Top rows (first 6) are cleared to background to remove initial walls or artifacts, but this must not affect lower structures prematurely.
 * Empty spaces (0s) are filled with color 8 globally, but subsequent shifts and extensions treat 8 as a special "connector" that can be extended vertically (up to row 0 and down until hitting non-background/non-fill) and horizontally (extending blocks by 2 columns, filling small gaps <=4 wide in connection rows).
 * Blocks (non-background) are shifted up by a fixed amount (6 rows) per column, preserving contiguous same-color runs but clipping to the top and filling old positions with background; this must handle multiple runs per column without merging unrelated colors.
 * Vertical extensions for fill (8) merge ranges within a column and extend only through background, stopping at other colors; subtle: down-extension stops at non-background non-fill, but up-extension only if background.
 * Horizontal connections occur only in rows with at least two consecutive 8s, extending non-background blocks right by 2 (clipped), then filling gaps <=4 between them with 8, but only if background; this creates "bridges" but over-applies if rows are misidentified.
 * Lower connections involve identifying the bottom-most non-background row, adding full horizontal 8 fills from column 4 to 23 at that row-1 (and possibly row-2), plus targeted vertical fills in specific left columns (e.g., 4,5,8,9) down to the bottom; subtle: this seems puzzle-specific to certain shapes and may not generalize.
 * Errors like "list index out of range" likely stem from unhandled edge cases in loops (e.g., i +=1 exceeding 24 in shift_single_column or extend_fill_vertical when processing runs), especially if input grids have irregular block placements or no blocks in some columns.
 * Expected outputs show patterned connections with 8s forming "frames" or "paths" around colored blocks (e.g., 1s,2s,3s,4s,6s), with precise gaps and no overfilling; generated outputs often overfill with 8s or 3s/background, merge unrelated blocks, or fail to create exact gap patterns (e.g., expected has isolated 8 pairs like columns 8-9 and 16-17 in train1 row0, but generated fills entire sections).
 * Subtle: Shifts must preserve original colors without changing them to fill; connections don't overwrite existing non-background colors, only background.
 * Puzzle may involve symmetry or specific column starts (e.g., from col 4), and bottom blocks (like 2s in train1) remain unshifted if already low.
 * All operations compose sequentially, so order matters: clear/fill before shift, shift before extensions, upper connections before lower to avoid interfering with bottom fills.
 * Grids are 24x24, rows 0=top to 23=bottom; clipping must prevent index errors by using min/max.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented a sequential pipeline (clear top, fill 0s with 8, shift up by 6, vertical 8 extensions, upper horizontal connections, lower connections) but produced incorrect outputs for train1 and train2, with overfilling of 8s (e.g., train1 generated full rows of 3s/8s in top/mid where expected has sparse 8 pairs and gaps) and failure to preserve exact block positions/colors (e.g., 1s blocks extended wrongly, 4s not isolated properly).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated has solid 8 bands across columns 4-11 and 16-23 in rows 4-11, but expected has targeted 8s in cols 8-9/16-17 with 3s filling gaps elsewhere; bottom 2s correct but upper connections over-extend left 1s into 8s instead of keeping 3s; unknown why shift placed 1s starting at row3 instead of row3 with partial 8 integration.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated shifts 6s and 1s incorrectly (e.g., row0 has full 8s in cols8-12/18-19 but expected has sparse 8s with 1s/6s interrupting); lower 4s not connected properly, and mid 8s overfill across cols4-21 in rows5-10 where expected has gaps with 1s; 2s and 3s positions off due to faulty column shifts.
 * Train3 and test errors: "list index out of range" likely from shift_single_column or extend_fill_vertical where i exceeds 23 in while loops (e.g., if a run ends at i=23, inner while pushes i=24); indicates poor boundary handling in run-length encoding.
 * add_upper_connections over-applies extensions (extends by 2 right unconditionally, fills gaps <=4 even if not needed, leading to merged blobs); not subtle enough for sparse expected patterns.
 * add_lower_connections is too rigid (hardcodes cols 4,5,8,9 for vertical fills and row bottom_start-1/-2 for horizontals), works for train1 bottom but fails generalization (e.g., train2 bottom at row17 with 4s not matching); unhelpful for variable bottoms.
 * extend_fill_vertical merges all 8 ranges per column into one overall min/max, but over-extends down (fills through non-b in some cases); subtle bug: doesn't stop down-extension at non-8 non-b correctly in all scenarios.
 * shift_blocks_up uses fixed amount=6, which works for some but may not for varying block heights; preserves runs but clips poorly if new_start negative.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of core sequence (clear/shift/connect) but misses precision in connections (too aggressive filling) and error-prone loops; get_background, clear_top, fill_empties, and shift_single_column (fixed) are helpful, but add_upper/lower_connections and extend_fill_vertical are broken/overly specific (avoid or refactor).

**Test output:**
 * No generated test output provided (only ERROR: list index out of range), so cannot visually assess; error suggests same boundary issue as train3, meaning the program crashes before producing output, indicating it doesn't handle the test input's grid structure (possibly empty columns, all-background rows, or blocks at edges causing loop overflows).
 * Without test grid, cannot mentally simulate exact output, but based on patterns in trains, expected test likely involves similar 8 connections around shifted colored blocks (e.g., isolating shapes like 1s/4s with 8 paths from col4+); current attempt would fail due to crash, so output doesn't make sense—must fix indices first (e.g., add i < 24 checks in all whiles).
 * Test likely tests generalization (e.g., different background, variable shift needs, or no top clear needed), so over-reliance on fixed amount=6 or col4 starts would mismatch; ensure no overfill like in trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the number 8 (likely representing a spreading "ink" or fill) must be propagated or "spread" across certain rows in a subgrid (rows 6-24 of a larger grid), while respecting barriers defined by colored bars, protected cells, and special merge conditions. The goal is to transform the input grid by filling unprotected areas with 8s based on initial seeds or pairs, but avoiding overwriting specific colors or structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a header row (g[1]) with bar colors in specific segments (e.g., columns 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22, skipping zeros), which define protected colors that 8s cannot overwrite during spreading.
 * Protected set includes bar colors plus 5 (possibly a universal barrier or empty space indicator).
 * Merge condition triggers only if bar2 or bar3 is 6, potentially allowing special placement of initial 8 pairs in rows without existing 8s.
 * Initial pair detection looks for the first consecutive pair of 8s (count >=2) in subgrid rows, but placement is conditional on merge and only in rows lacking any 8s originally; however, this seems overly restrictive and doesn't propagate the pair across rows.
 * Spreading function expands contiguous 8s left/right until hitting protected cells or grid edges, but only applied to rows that originally contain 8s; it skips rows without 8s except via the pair logic.
 * Subtleties: Spreading is row-wise only (no vertical propagation), and initial seeds might need to be placed or detected differently—e.g., pairs may indicate starting points for vertical or multi-row fills. Protected cells block but don't get filled. Bars might represent dividers that 8s can't cross vertically or horizontally. In examples, 8s often form blobs or lines that align with non-protected areas, suggesting connected component filling. Easy to miss: Some rows need 8s inserted even without originals if they align with vertical continuity from above/below; merge=6 might enable crossing a central barrier. Original 8s must be preserved and expanded, but not all empty (0 or other) cells get filled—only those adjacent to 8s. Grid is 19 rows deep for subgrid, but spreading doesn't handle multi-row connectivity well.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    row = g[1]

    bar2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)

    bar4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)

                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] not in protected:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This performs horizontal spreading from existing 8 blocks, avoiding protected; core logic for expansion but limited to single rows and doesn't handle vertical.)

```python
def get_initial_pair(g: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for row in g[6:25]:
        i = 0
        n = len(row)
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == 8:
                start = i
                count = 0
                while i < n and row[i] == 8:
                    i += 1
                    count += 1
                if count >= 2:
                    return (start, start + 1)
            else:
                i += 1
    return None
```
(Detects first pair of consecutive 8s for seeding, but returns only positions in one row; useful but incomplete as it doesn't propagate vertically or check all rows.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating the core spreading and seeding logic is flawed—e.g., it under-fills 8s in areas that should connect vertically or across barriers under merge conditions.
 * Train 1: Generated spread 8s correctly in some central rows (e.g., full 8s in rows 7-8 matching expected), but failed to place 8s in right-side positions (e.g., expected 8,8 in columns 16-17 for top rows, but generated 3,3; also missed vertical extension in rows 9-11 where expected 8,8 in cols 4-5 but generated 3,3; row 14 has no 8s in cols 4-7 where expected full 8s). Pair placement didn't trigger properly, and spreading didn't extend to non-original-8 rows. What worked: Protected 3 and 4 areas correctly; horizontal spreads in seeded rows.
 * Train 2: Generated initial 8,8 pairs in cols 8-9 correctly for top rows, but missed left-side 8s in cols 4-5 (expected 8,8 but generated 1,1); row 2 expected 8s in cols 14-21 but generated 6s/1s; central merge (bar3=6?) not handled to fill row 2 cols 14-21 with 8s; bottom rows under-filled (e.g., row 14 expected full 8s cols 8-23 but generated partial). What worked: Spread in row 8-9 full 8s; protected 1,3,6 areas. Pair detection missed or not applied vertically.
 * Train 3: Generated some 8 spreads (e.g., cols 12-13 in middle rows), but missed left extensions (e.g., top rows expected 8,8 in cols 3-4 but generated 7,7; row 4 expected 8,8 cols 3-4 but generated 7,7); row 5 over-filled with 7s where expected 8s cols 0-11; vertical blobs not connected (e.g., row 14 expected 8s cols 20-23 but generated 6s). What worked: Right-side 6 protections; some horizontal spreads in row 11-12. Merge (bar4=6?) not enabling cross-bar fills.
 * get_initial_pair is helpful for seeding but broken in application—only places in one row and only if no original 8s, missing vertical propagation; don't rely on it alone.
 * has_eight (checks if 8 in row) is simple but useful for identifying seed rows; however, the main program logic skips spreading on non-seed rows too aggressively.
 * Overall, attempts show understanding of bars/protected but fail on vertical connectivity, merge-enabled fills across central areas (e.g., when bar=6, 8s might bridge gaps), and inserting seeds in empty rows based on alignment rather than single pair.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it over-fills with 9s in many areas (e.g., rows 3-6 full 9s where 8s should spread instead, assuming 9 is a bar color but spreading logic treated it wrong); row 7 has 1s in cols 0-2 then full 8s, but if vertical from above, more 8s expected in left; rows 13-16 full 9s bottom-right, but spreading should stop at protected 3s in cols 21-23; row 17 full 9s, row 18 partial 4s in center but no 8s where seeds might start. It ignores potential vertical 8 propagation from row 7-10's 8s downward, and pair/merge not detected (no initial 8 pair found?). This suggests the program didn't extract bars correctly (bars seem 2 left, 9 center/right, 3/4 bottom), leading to wrong protected set; output looks like it copied input without proper 8 spreading, making it incoherent for a fill puzzle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to detect a background color, shift and clean the main content into a 19-row output grid, identify a central "maroon" object (color 8) bounding box, and then augment the grid by adding maroon (8) elements to form structural extensions like vertical risers, horizontal connectors, and bottom fills that frame or connect the maroon object to surrounding elements, while respecting spans, gaps, and conditional placements based on other non-background objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent non-0, non-5 color in the input's rows 6-23 (likely the "empty" or filler space); defaults to 3 if tied or unclear.
 * Content shifting extracts rows 6-23 of input into rows 0-18 of output, replacing 0s and 5s with background, and duplicates the last row if needed to fill 19 rows—ensures no original borders or artifacts remain.
 * Maroon object (color 8) bounding box (min/max row/col) is extracted from input rows 6-23, shifted to 0-based output coordinates; if absent, defaults to invalid (0,0,0,0) which may skip augmentations.
 * Horizontal span calculation for the maroon's y-range finds the minimal left/right bounds that cover all non-bg cells in that vertical slice, effectively determining a "coverage width" that may extend beyond the maroon itself to include nearby objects.
 * Upward verticals (risers) are placed as 8's above the maroon: always internal (over maroon cols), always right-aligned (shifted to end of span), and conditionally left-aligned if there's a left-side object whose vertical extent is close enough (distance <= maroon_width +1) to justify connection.
 * Horizontal shorts place 8's directly over the maroon and span positions within the maroon's y-range, but only on bg cells; gaps between sorted positions are connected horizontally with 8's in the y-range only if the entire gap above (rows 0 to y1-1) is clear of non-bg.
 * Downward verticals start right after maroon (y2+1) and extend to a fixed row 13; placed for internal (maroon cols), conditional left (if left object extends below maroon by >= maroon_width +1), and always right; if down height matches maroon height, full horizontal connection across all down positions in those rows.
 * Bottom full fill starts at row 14, height matching maroon height (up to row 18), spanning from leftmost down position to either full width (if no right extensions below row 13) or rightmost down position; only on bg cells.
 * Subtleties: All placements overwrite only bg cells (no overwriting existing content); connections require clear space above/below for verticals; fixed row limits (e.g., down to 13, bottom from 14) suggest a structured output height with distinct zones (top for risers, middle for object, bottom for base); spans must account for all non-bg in y-range to avoid narrow framing; left/right placements are asymmetric and conditional on nearby object extents (e.g., left_start_y, right_end_y, left_end_y); maroon_width drives many decisions (e.g., connection lengths); potential for overfilling if conditions misapplied, like placing left up/down too aggressively.
 * Edge cases: No maroon (skip augmentations?); maroon near edges (clamp to 0/width-1); varying object positions (left, center, right) affect span and connections; heights may not align perfectly, so fixed down_y2=13 acts as a cap; output is always 19 rows x input width, with last input row duplicated if short.
 * Across attempts: Preserve original non-8, non-bg content exactly (e.g., 1's, 2's, 4's, 6's, 9's); 8's only added, never removed; consider full-width bottoms only if no protruding right objects.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    counts = [0] * 16
    for row in g[6:24]:
        for cell in row:

    for c in range(16):
        if counts[c] == max_count:
            return c
    return 3  # default
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most common non-0/5 in content area; useful for cleaning.)

```python
def shift_content(g, bg):

    grid = [[bg for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height_out)]
    for i in range(6, 24):
        out_i = i - 6
        if out_i >= height_out:

            cell = g[i][j]
            if cell != 0 and cell != 5:

    # copy last row
    if height_out > 0:
        grid[height_out - 1] = grid[height_out - 2][:]
    return grid
```
(This extracts and cleans content reliably; essential for base grid setup; duplication handles short inputs.)

(Bounding box for 8's in content area, shifted to output coords; core for locating target object; handles absence gracefully.)

        if is_non_bg:
            left_start = min(left_start, j)
    start_span = left_start + 1 if left_start < width else 0
    start_span = max(0, start_span)

(Computes effective horizontal coverage for y-range; key for determining frame width; but note potential off-by-one in end_span calc, as it sets to width-1 on no non-bg, which may overextend.)

```
(Finds vertical extent of left-side objects before start col; useful for conditional left placements.)

                break
    return right_end_y
```
(Finds vertical extent of right-side objects after end col; useful for bottom span decisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly detects bg (e.g., 3 in train 1, 1 in train 2/3) and shifts content without artifacts, preserving original shapes like the 1's block, 2's base, 4's bottom in train 1.
 * Upward verticals partially work: internal and right placements add 8's correctly in many spots (e.g., train 1 rows 0-2 over maroon cols 8-9), but left up is overplaced or missing (train 1: no left 8's in rows 0-3 cols 0-4 where expected; train 2: misplaced left 8's in rows 0-2 cols 0-3 instead of cols 4-5).
 * Horizontal shorts/connects fail consistently: shorts overplace 8's (train 1 rows 4-11 cols 0-3 have 1's unchanged but expected 8's in rows 7-8 cols 4-7; no connection between left/middle in row 12); gaps not connected properly (train 2: no horizontal 8's in row 2 cols 11-19 where expected full connect; train 3: overconnects in rows 4-6 cols 0-7 with 7's unchanged to 8's incorrectly).
 * Downward verticals are incomplete: internal/right placed but left conditional wrong (train 1: no left down 8's in rows 12-13 cols 0-3; train 3: down in rows 12-13 cols 12-13 correct but no full connect); height match for full down connect misapplied (train 2: down height=3 but no wide 8's in rows 11-13 cols 4-20).
 * Bottom full miscalculates span/end: overfills or underfills (train 1: rows 14-16 cols 0-23 with 8's but expected only partial; train 3: row 14-16 cols 0-3 and 8-23 but generated full 8's incorrectly; train 2: no bottom 8's at all, just original 4's).
 * calculate_span often computes wrong bounds (train 1: start=0, end=23? leading to full-width overplacements; train 2: narrow span misses right extensions); conditions like place_left_up/down use wrong thresholds (e.g., <= maroon_width +1 too loose, causing phantom lefts).
 * find_left_start_end and find_right_end_y are helpful but underused—e.g., left_start_y=100 (no left object) should skip left up, but code places it anyway in some cases; right_end_y <=13 for full bottom not triggering correctly.
 * pos_list and sorted_pos for horizontals/down are conceptually good for multi-object connects but fail on gap checking (can_connect checks rows 0-y1 but places in y1-y2, and breaks early without full scan).
 * No removal of existing 8's—assumes clean shift, but if input has extras, they persist.
 * Train 1 mismatches: generated keeps left 1's in rows 4-11 cols 0-3 (correct) but misses extending 8's left in rows 7-8 cols 4-7 to connect to 1's; row 12 has 3's where expected 8's cols 4-5; bottom rows 14-16 overfill with 8's cols 0-3 instead of stopping at 4.
 * Train 2 mismatches: generated places 8's in wrong left positions (rows 0-4 cols 1-2 instead of cols 4-5); row 2 has fragmented 8's cols 13-17/19 instead of full cols 11-20; down missing entirely (rows 11-13 all 1's/bg where expected 8's cols 4-5/14-15/19?); bottom 4's unchanged but no 8's added.
 * Train 3 mismatches: generated misses left extensions (rows 0-3 cols 0-3 should be 8's over 7's? but expected cols 3-4 8's); rows 4-6 cols 0-7 all 7's unchanged instead of 8's cols 0-11; row 11 overconnects cols 4-23 with 8's but expected partial; bottom row 14 has 8's cols 3-23 but expected cols 0-23 except gaps.
 * Function calculate_span is broken in end_span logic (sets to width-1 on no right non-bg, causing full-width spans incorrectly); find_right_end_y returns -1 if no right objects, but code uses <=13 which may false-positive.
 * The down_connect_pos appending right without condition leads to unintended full spans; bottom_y2 = min(18, 14 + maroon_height -1) is good but start_full/end_full logic fails when down_pos empty (falls back to maroon, missing extensions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overplaces 8's extensively (e.g., rows 7-13 cols 3-20 all 8's, row 14 full 8's cols 3-23, rows 15-16 full 8's) while leaving original 9's and 1's fragmented without proper connections—e.g., no upward risers above the maroon in rows 0-3 cols 8-10/20, and bottom row 17-18 has partial 8's cols 0-2/16-23 mixing with 4's/9's instead of a clean full base; this suggests span calc went full-width incorrectly, and left/right conditionals failed to limit to maroon-adjacent objects (e.g., the left 9's block and right 3's aren't connected properly with shorts/verticals). It mismatches training patterns by not preserving object shapes (e.g., 9's in rows 4-6 cols 0-7/11-19 overwritten partially) and lacks gap-aware connects (e.g., no clear horizontal in row 6 cols 10-19). To handle test, need tighter span (only cover maroon + immediate neighbors), stricter left/right y-extent checks (e.g., distance thresholds based on actual object heights), and bg-only overwrites to avoid smashing 9's/1's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based structure (likely a building or platform) where the goal is to identify key colored components (e.g., supports, floors, and special elements like maroon blobs) and fill in background areas with a structural color (8, appearing as maroon) to complete supports and horizontal floors, while shifting the grid upward to simulate a "build" or "completion" effect. The output modifies the input grid by replacing background pixels with 8 in specific vertical and horizontal regions based on component positions, ensuring structural integrity without overwriting non-background elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid has 30 rows (0-29), but processing focuses on rows 6-23 for analysis; the shift_up function copies rows 6-23 to output rows 0-17 and row 23 to row 18, effectively cropping out top rows (0-5) and bottom row (24-29?) to create a 19-row output, which may simulate removing a "ground" or "sky" layer.
 * Background color (C) is the most common non-zero, non-5 color in rows 6-23, excluding 5 (possibly a special "void" or "edge" color); fills only replace C with 8, preserving other colors like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9.
 * Components are rectangular blobs of the same color, size >=4, found via flood-fill-like expansion (horizontal then vertical), excluding C, 0, and 5; they represent structural elements like platforms, walls, or objects.
 * Supports are vertical fills (full height or partial) at specific columns: left starts after the right edge of the leftmost non-8 component; middle uses the maroon (8) component's column range; right starts 2 columns left of the rightmost upper non-8 component (above bottom component).
 * Floors are horizontal fills with 8: for an upper "floor1" at the shifted maroon height (small_minr-6 to small_maxr-6), spanning left to right supports; if "far" (floor1 max row +2 < base row), add a base horizontal at (bottom_minr-6)-2 spanning from bottom component's left to grid right.
 * Subtleties: Maroon (8) components are treated specially (e.g., as middle support or "small" element), but input may already have 8s that shouldn't be overwritten; right support is often partial (only up to floor1 height, not full); "is_far" logic detects multi-level structures; bottom component is the lowest non-8; no diagonal or non-rectangular shapes—assumes axis-aligned rectangles; 5 may be ignored as non-fillable; output must match exactly, including preserving non-C areas.
 * Edge cases: No non-maroon components defaults left support to col 4; no upper components defaults right to col 20; base horizontal only from bottom_start if far; horizontal fills are 1-2 rows thick, but code varies (e.g., floor1_min to floor1_max vs single row).
 * All fills are conditional on C only, so over-filling (e.g., replacing non-C) or under-filling (missing partial supports) breaks outputs; grid width is 24 columns consistently.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of support/floor logic, especially partial fills and multi-level detection.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8 fills in left/middle areas (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 0-3 filled with 8 instead of preserving 3; row 7-8 full 8 horizontal too wide, overwriting 3s; bottom rows 16-18 have 8s in cols 17-18 where expected 3s; row 11-12 have 8s in cols 18-19 where expected 3s/4s). Missed preserving background 3 in non-support areas; overfilled right support below floor1; horizontal floor1 at single row instead of range; is_far logic failed, no base horizontal added correctly.
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled 8s in upper areas (e.g., row 2 cols 6-17 all 8, but expected partial with 1s; row 4 cols 16-17=3 but filled 8? Wait, input has 3 there?); row 9-10 full 8 in cols 6-17 overwriting 1s; bottom rows 16-18 have 8 in col 5 and cols 17-18 where expected 1s; missed narrowing middle support to avoid overwriting 6s/3s; right support too wide/full height; horizontal in row 14-15 too narrow, missing full span.
 * Train 3: Generated partial 8 fills incorrectly (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 18-19=8 but expected 7/8 mix; row 4 cols 0-7=7 but expected 8 full; row 12 full 8 horizontal but expected partial; row 14 cols 20-21=6 but filled 8?; row 16-18 cols 0-2=2 preserved but cols 3-5=8 where expected 7). Underfilled upper supports (e.g., row 4-6 left/middle not fully 8); overfilled right in lower areas; base horizontal in row 16-18 cols 8-21=4 preserved but supports wrong; get_bottom_comp likely buggy (max min_r picks wrong "bottom").
 * Overall: Component detection works (finds blobs), but positioning (e.g., right_start -2) and fill ranges (partial right, is_far for base) fail consistently; shift_up preserves structure but fills ignore levels; no handling for pre-existing 8s or color-specific rules (e.g., 6/4 as special); unhelpful: get_right_support_start filters upper but defaults high (20), causing wide overfills; fill functions are safe but applied wrongly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills with 8 in central columns (e.g., cols 8-19 rows 3-16 mostly 8, creating a wide "pillar" that overwrites what should be preserved 9s/1s for structure), while leaving top rows 0-2 all 2s (correct preservation?) but bottom row 18 has 4s starting col 7 (partial, but spans to col 16 with 9s/8s mismatched). Expected likely narrower supports (e.g., left at col 0-3 for 1s? No, test input has 2s top, 9s middle, 1s lower left, 4s bottom partial), with vertical 8s only at edges/middle based on components (e.g., maroon? None visible, so defaults fail); horizontals missing for floors (e.g., no 8 row at 1s height or base); right support seems partial but too low (row 13-16 cols 20-23=8/9 mix wrong); is_far probably misdetected, no base fill; overall, looks like generic overfill without adapting to test's tall 9/1 stack and right-edge 3s—suggests program assumes maroon presence and fixed widths, breaking on test's layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle simulating the flow or spread of a special element (represented by 8, possibly liquid or filler) across a background in a 19x24 subgrid (rows 6-24 of input), where it expands into adjacent background cells based on rules involving colored bars, pillars (vertical lines of 8), and merging conditions, while preserving other colored objects and filling voids (0 or 5) with background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the most common non-zero, non-5 color in the lower subgrid (rows 6-24), excluding 8; this fills all 0 and 5 cells initially, but 8 can overwrite bg cells during spreading.
 * Four horizontal bars (b1-b4) are extracted from row 1 at specific column ranges (1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22); their colors (non-zero) influence behavior—e.g., b2 or b3 == 6 triggers "merge" mode for bidirectional spreading.
 * Spreading of 8 occurs only in rows that originally contain 8; it expands leftward (or both directions in merge mode) into contiguous bg cells adjacent to 8 blocks, but does not cross non-bg cells or other colors.
 * Pillars are vertical columns containing any 8 in the input subgrid; in merge mode, these are pre-filled with 8 in every output row where the cell is bg, creating persistent vertical spread paths.
 * Subtleties: Spreading is per-row and only activates if the row has 8 initially; pillars add 8 to bg cells in those columns before spreading, but only in merge mode; repeated identical rows in output suggest no change or full fill; 8 blocks are treated as contiguous segments for expansion, but do not merge across non-bg gaps.
 * Easy to miss: get_background excludes 8 and 5 correctly, but flat list must avoid empty cases; bar extraction takes first non-zero in each segment; spreading loops must handle multiple 8 segments per row without overlapping incorrectly; output preserves original non-bg, non-8 colors exactly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Merge mode (b2/b3==6) should enable bidirectional spread and pillar pre-filling, but non-merge uses only leftward spread without pillars; pillars are global (from all input rows) but applied row-by-row; no vertical spreading—everything is horizontal per row; test inputs may have unique bar configs or pillar positions requiring exact column tracking.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [g[r][c] for r in range(6, 25) for c in range(24) if g[r][c] != 0 and g[r][c] != 5]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode color, excluding voids and 8; useful for initial fill.)

```python
def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    row = g[1]
    b1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)
    b2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    b3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    b4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return b1, b2, b3, b4
```
(This extracts bar colors from fixed positions in row 1; essential for determining merge/spread mode.)

```python
def has_merge(b2: int, b3: int) -> bool:
    return b2 == 6 or b3 == 6
```
(Simple but key for toggling bidirectional spread and pillar usage.)

```python
def spread_left(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] == bg:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            i = end + 1
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(Handles leftward expansion from 8 blocks into bg; useful for non-merge cases, but note it skips rightward.)

```python
def spread_both(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    n = len(new_row)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] == bg:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] == bg:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(Extends leftward + rightward; critical for merge mode, handles contiguous bg on both sides.)

```python
def get_pillar_cols(g: List[List[int]]) -> list:
    cols = set()
    for r in range(6, 25):
        for c in range(24):
            if g[r][c] == 8:
                cols.add(c)
    return list(cols)
```
(Identifies all columns with any 8 for pre-filling in merge mode; helpful but only applied conditionally.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt processes the subgrid correctly (rows 6-24 into 19 output rows) and applies bg fill to 0/5, but all three training examples fail due to incorrect spreading and pillar handling.
 * Train 1 (likely non-merge): Generated spreads 8 leftward in some rows but fails to place additional 8s in columns 16-17 (expected 8,8 there in top rows and some middle); also misses leftward fill in row 9-10 (expected 8,8 in cols 4-5) and full horizontal 8 spread in row 14-15 (generated has gaps at cols 6-15,17-23); bottom rows match expected 2s and 3s.
 * Train 2 (merge mode, b3=6?): Generated incorrectly places initial 8s only in cols 8-9 without pillars, leading to no spread into cols 4-5 or 14-21; row 2 has no rightward 8s in cols 14-21 (expected full 8,8,1... but wait, expected has 8s in 4-5 and 8-9, then 14-21); row 14 has no 8s in cols 8-15,17-23 (expected full 8s there); preserves 6s and 4s correctly but misses bidirectional expansion.
 * Train 3 (merge mode?): Generated pre-fills pillars (cols 12-13?) but spreads incorrectly—e.g., row 0-2 have 3s in cols 8-17 instead of expected 3s only in 8-17 with 8s in 0-3,20-23? Wait, expected has 8s in 3-4 and 19-20; row 4 has 7s in cols 8-11 instead of full 8s; row 11-12 have 8s only in 3-15? but expected full 8s 3-21; row 14 has 7s in 20-23 instead of 6s? No, expected has 6s preserved but 8s around; overall, pillar pre-fill happens but spreading doesn't connect properly, and some original colors like 6s are overwritten incorrectly.
 * What worked: Bg detection and fill seem accurate (e.g., 3s in Train 1, 1s in Train 2); bar extraction and merge detection likely correct (activates both-spread in Trains 2/3); per-row 8 presence check prevents unwanted spreading; preserves non-bg elements like 1s,2s,4s,6s.
 * What didn't: Pillar pre-fill in merge mode is applied to all rows but only where bg, yet doesn't lead to correct connections (e.g., no vertical propagation, but horizontal spread from them fails); spreading functions expand correctly for isolated 8s but miss multi-segment or pillar-induced fills; in non-merge, no pillars means isolated left-spreads only; loop in spread_both sets i=j after right spread, which skips if no right bg but may miss multiple segments; get_pillar_cols collects all 8-cols but in Train 1 (non-merge) it's unused, causing misses.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, but the main program integration (applying pillars before spread, conditional spread) is buggy; e.g., pillars added after bg fill but before spread, yet in Train 1 expected has 8s in non-pillar cols.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows excessive 2s and 9s in early rows with 8s only in row 7 (cols 3-10?), but no clear spreading pattern—e.g., row 0-2 are all 2s except right 3s, row 3-5 all 9s with right 3s, row 6 has 1s then 9s, row 7 has 1s,8s,9s, but expected likely involves bg=3 or 9?, bars determining merge (possibly b4=3 irrelevant, check b2/b3), pillars from input 8s (maybe col 3?), and spreading 8s bidirectionally if merge, filling into bg but preserving 1s/4s; instead, it seems to ignore pillars entirely (no vertical 8s persisting), spreads minimally left-only in row 7 without connecting to row 6's potential, and row 17-18 have 4s in cols 7-16 but no 8 integration, suggesting broken pillar or merge detection for this input's bar colors (possibly no merge, but still misses left-spreads); overall, lacks the connected 8 fills seen in expected trains, like full rows or extended segments.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a special spreading color (8) originates from seed positions in a grid and floods into adjacent background areas, but is blocked by protected colors (derived from side bars and special elements like 5), forming connected blobs that can span horizontally and vertically. The goal is to simulate this spread correctly on the working area (rows 6:25 of the grid), preserving non-background and protected elements while overwriting only eligible background cells with 8.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid represents a 2D canvas with colors (integers 1-9 likely), where 0 is empty/undefined, 5 is a special blocker (e.g., walls or barriers), and other numbers are colored objects or background.
 * Side bars (vertical colored strips on left/right edges, extracted from row 1 at specific column ranges like 1-4, 7-10, etc.) provide protected colors that cannot be overwritten by 8; these bars indicate "object" colors that act as barriers.
 * Background color is the most common non-0, non-5 color in the working area (rows 6-24), used to identify what 8 can spread over; spreading only occurs on this background, not on other colors.
 * Spreading of 8 is a flood-fill-like process from initial seed 8s, propagating to orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) background cells, but not diagonally; connections must be contiguous, forming blobs that can grow vertically across rows and horizontally within rows.
 * Subtlety: Initial 8 seeds may be sparse or absent in some rows, but vertical adjacency allows spread from above/below rows, which the current approach misses entirely—leading to isolated horizontal spreads instead of full connected components.
 * Protected set includes all bar colors plus 5; do not spread into or over these, even if adjacent to background.
 * Grids are 24 columns wide; working area is rows 6-24 (19 rows outputted), but top/bottom rows may have partial spreads due to edge effects or no seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Spread does not overwrite existing non-background objects (e.g., small colored blobs like 1s, 2s, 4s, 6s); in expected outputs, these remain intact while surrounding background turns to 8 if connected.
 * Another subtlety: In some cases (e.g., train 3), spreads form complex L-shapes or partial fills around objects, suggesting barriers can create enclosed areas that only partially fill if seeds don't reach all parts.
 * No spreading outside the working area (rows 0-5 are UI/bars, ignored in output).
 * If no background is detected (all 0/5), no spread occurs, but this is rare.
 * Seeds (initial 8s) are part of the input grid and must be preserved/expanded from, not created anew.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies bar colors and background but fails to spread 8 vertically, only handling horizontal expansion per row, resulting in disconnected or over/under-filled blobs.
 * In training example 1: Generated fills entire top rows (0-2 of output) with background 3 instead of placing vertical 8 lines in columns 8-9 and 16-17 (as in expected); middle rows (e.g., output row 7-8) spread 8 fully horizontally from col 4-17 over 3, but expected has contained 8s only in specific columns without full row fill; bottom rows correctly preserve 2s and 4s but miss vertical extensions (e.g., output row 9-10 have full 8 in cols 4-17, but expected narrows to cols 4-5 and 8-9); unknown why top rows are uniformly 3 (perhaps initial grid had no seeds there, and no vertical propagation).
 * In training example 2: Generated spreads 8 only horizontally in rows 3-4 of output (cols 4-15 over bg 1), but expected shows vertical chains of 8s in cols 4-5, 8-9, 14-17, and 20-23, with partial fills (e.g., row 2 has full 8 in cols 13-23, but generated has all 1s); top rows (0-1) correctly preserve 6s but miss 8 extensions into cols 4-5 and 8-9; bottom rows preserve 4s correctly but no spread into them.
 * In training example 3: Generated spreads 8 horizontally in output row 11 (cols 3-19 over bg 7?), creating a full bar of 8, but expected has contained vertical 8s in cols 3-4 and 18-19, plus complex shapes (e.g., row 4 has full 8 in cols 0-7 and 16-19, but generated has all 7s); right side 6s are preserved but miss adjacent 8 fills; bottom rows correctly keep 4s but no vertical connection from above.
 * spread_row function is partially helpful for horizontal spread but broken/incomplete without vertical integration; it assumes independent rows, missing contiguous blobs across rows.
 * get_bar_colors and get_background are helpful and seem accurate (protected sets like {1,2,4,5} for train1 match patterns), but not sufficient alone.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of protection and bg detection but zero grasp of vertical flood-fill.
 * Overall, all training examples fail due to lack of vertical propagation, leading to mismatched blob shapes/sizes (e.g., expected blobs are taller/narrower, generated are wider/shorter or absent).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows horizontal-only spreading of 8 in output rows 7-9 (full from col 3 to 21 over presumed bg 9), but leaves top rows (0-2) as all 2s and rows 10-16 as 9s without any 8 penetration, suggesting no vertical spread from the middle 8 seeds upward or downward.
 * This mismatches likely expected behavior: Based on training patterns, 8 should propagate vertically to form connected columns or blobs (e.g., potentially filling cols 3-21 in more rows if bg-connected, or creating partial vertical lines around preserved 1s and bottom 4s); top 2s and widespread 9s remain untouched except horizontally in middle, but expected would likely have 8 extensions into row 3-6 (where 1s and 9s mix) and possibly bottom rows if adjacent to bg.
 * The uniform 2s in top rows and full 9s below indicate isolated horizontal fills, ignoring vertical adjacency—e.g., row 6 has 1s then 9s turning to 8 below, but no upward spread into row 5's 9s; this doesn't make sense for a connected flood puzzle, as seeds in row 7 should reach upward if bg=9 is eligible.
 * Bottom rows (17-18) preserve 4s correctly but show no 8 spread into surrounding 9s, unlike training where adjacent bg gets filled vertically; test likely needs vertical flood to handle the tall 9 block.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 00:22:02] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely 25 rows by 24 columns) where the goal is to simulate spreading or propagation effects starting from certain "8" elements (possibly holes or voids), while respecting protected colors (like bars and a special color 5), computing a background color, and conditionally placing "pillars" based on merge conditions between bar elements, ultimately producing a modified lower grid section.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct sections: upper rows (e.g., row 1) for extracting bar colors (non-zero values in specific column slices like 1:5, 7:11, etc.), and lower rows (6:25) for the main simulation area.
 * Protected colors include bar colors (if >0) and always 5; these prevent overwriting during spreading or background computation.
 * Background (bg) is the most common non-zero, non-protected, non-8 color in the flattened lower grid (rows 6:25); if none, bg=0.
 * "8" elements represent propagatable voids: they spread horizontally over adjacent bg cells (left/right extensions), but skip protected cells.
 * Downward propagation: If an 8 appears above a bg cell in the same column, turn that bg to 8, then re-apply horizontal spreading to the affected row if new 8's were introduced or if the original row had 8's.
 * Merge detection: Between bar2 and bar3; if either is 6, it triggers pillar placements (hardcoded positions like (8,9), conditional on other bar values like bar1=4 or bar3=4).
 * Pillars: Conditionally place 8's in specific column pairs across all lower rows, but only if those positions aren't already protected.
 * Subtlety: Horizontal spreading only initially applies to rows that originally contain 8's; downward prop then triggers further spreading in affected rows.
 * Edge cases: Empty flat list for bg defaults to 0; spreading stops at grid boundaries (0 to 23 columns); pillars are placed before any spreading.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes n=24 columns but doesn't validate grid shape; merge/pillar logic is heuristic/hardcoded from "training patterns," which may not generalize.
 * Propagation is row-by-row downward, but only checks immediate above row per iteration—may need multiple passes if chains form (though code does one pass).
 * 8's don't spread over other 8's or protected; bg spreading can chain horizontally but not vertically without downward prop.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def get_bar_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    row = g[1]
    bar1 = next((c for c in row[1:5] if c != 0), 0)
    bar2 = next((c for c in row[7:11] if c != 0), 0)
    bar3 = next((c for c in row[13:17] if c != 0), 0)
    bar4 = next((c for c in row[19:23] if c != 0), 0)
    return bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4
```
(This extracts bar colors from specific non-zero positions in row 1; useful for protected set and merge detection.)

```python
def compute_bg(g: List[List[int]], protected: set) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g[6:25] for cell in row if cell != 0 and cell not in protected and cell != 8]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This computes background as mode of eligible cells; core for spreading logic.)

```python
def spread_horizontal(row: List[int], bg: int, protected: set, n: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if new_row[i] == 8:
            start = i
            while i < n and new_row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            j = start - 1
            while j >= 0 and new_row[j] == bg:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j -= 1
            j = end + 1
            while j < n and new_row[j] == bg:
                new_row[j] = 8
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```
(This handles horizontal extension of 8's over bg; skips protected implicitly by not overwriting them, but doesn't check protected in loop—potential bug if bg is protected, though bg isn't.)

```python
def has_merge(bar2: int, bar3: int) -> bool:
    return bar2 == 6 or bar3 == 6
```
(Simple merge flag; triggers pillar logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to implement bar extraction, protected sets, bg computation, horizontal spreading of 8's over bg, downward propagation, and conditional pillar placement for merges, showing partial understanding of core mechanics like protection and spreading.
 * What worked: Functions like get_bar_colors, compute_bg, spread_horizontal, and has_merge are syntactically correct and logically sound for their roles; protected set inclusion of bars and 5 is appropriate; initial pillar placement loop respects protection.
 * What didn't work: Execution error across all examples ("cannot access local variable 'has_merge' where it is not associated with a value")—likely due to a scoping or indentation issue in the program function (has_merge is defined but perhaps not visible in the pillar if-block or later uses; code snippet shows it defined before use, so possible copy-paste/formatting error in execution environment).
 * No outputs generated due to error, so unable to validate spreading/propagation effects; pillar logic is hardcoded and may not generalize beyond "training patterns."
 * Horizontal spreading only applied initially to rows with original 8's, which is a subtlety, but downward prop re-applies it—correct in intent but untested.
 * propagate_downward function has a bug: references 'g' (original grid) inside loop ("if has_new or 8 in g[6 + r]"), but should use 'out' for consistency; also, spreads every time has_new, even if no original 8's, which might over-spread.
 * No extraction of other objects (e.g., blobs or keys) beyond bars; puzzle may involve more elements like these, but code focuses narrowly on 8's and bars.
 * Merge/pillar conditions are brittle (e.g., specific if bar2==6 and bar3==4 add (16,17)); unhelpful if patterns vary.
 * Overall, demonstrates understanding of protection, bg, and spreading but fails execution; no training samples passed due to error.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to the variable access issue, so no grid is generated—does not make sense or match expected modified lower grid with spread 8's, pillars, and propagation.
 * Without actual output, cannot confirm if spreading correctly extends 8's over bg while protecting bars/5, or if pillars appear in merge cases (e.g., columns 8-9 always, others conditional).
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Assuming test grid has bars (e.g., bar2=6 triggering merge), bg as some common color (say 1), original 8's in lower rows spreading horizontally/vertically over 1's but not over protected (bars/5), and pillars adding 8's in specific columns across rows; current error prevents any of this, so fundamentally incorrect—missing all propagation effects and likely mismatching the visual puzzle's final state (e.g., no void filling or merging simulation).
 * Difference from expected: Expected is a List[List[int]] with modified rows 6:25 showing extended 8 regions; actual is runtime error, so completely non-matching (unknown exact test grid, but error blocks all logic).

[2025-10-02 00:22:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
