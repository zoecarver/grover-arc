=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 20:07:38] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 20:37:04] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 25-row grid (including clue rows at the top) to generate a 19-row output grid by identifying background colors, placing "seeds" (marked as 8) based on clue interpretations in specific positions and rows, propagating those 8's horizontally in certain "prop" rows (based on original 8 placements or rules), and filling remaining background areas while preserving other colored elements (like 1,2,4,6,9). The goal is to complete incomplete grid sections (marked with 5 as placeholders) according to visual logic rules derived from clues, likely a custom colored fill-in puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bkg) is determined by uniform rows excluding 5's; fallback to 3 if none found—must handle cases where bkg is 1,3,7,9 across examples.
 * Clue row (g[1]) uses groups at positions [1:5,7:11,13:17,19:23]; non-0/5 values indicate colors (1,2,3,4,6) that trigger seed pair placements (consecutive positions for 8's) based on position within group (0 or 3) and color-specific rules (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may shift pair based on next group, color 1 for lower rows shifts differently).
 * Seeds are placed as pairs of 8's in upper rows (0-15, using upper pairs up to max prop row) or lower rows (switching to lower pairs after max prop); only overwrite bkg areas.
 * Propagation of 8's: In rows with original 8's (has_prop), extend left/right from min/max 8 positions and fill gaps between 8's with 8's (assuming bkg in between); subtle: only in rows 0-15, and doesn't overwrite non-bkg.
 * Upper block (initial all-bkg rows) may get right-side propagation of 8's if "plus1" condition (rightmost seed starts at group_start+1) and limited to 2 rows.
 * Lower prop rows depend on first clue color (1→rows 14-15 right-fill from leftmost lower seed; 2→rows 13-14 same); fill rightward from seed start to end if bkg.
 * Replace all 5's with bkg globally after initial copy.
 * Subtleties: Upper/lower seed computation differs (is_lower flag affects activation for color 1 at pos 0); pair starts/ends vary by color/pos (e.g., color 6 at pos 0→start+1; color 2 at pos 3→start+3, special for last group); max_group limits (3 for upper,1 for lower); preserve non-bkg colors (1,2,4,6,9) and don't propagate over them.
 * Grid is 19 output rows x 24 cols; input may have full 25 rows with clues in 0-5? but code uses g[6:25] and g[1] as clue.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only in specific rows; seeds only in bkg areas; rightmost upper prop only if is_plus1 and in upper block; lower prop only if seeds exist and specific first color; no vertical propagation.
 * Other: Original 8's in input determine has_prop and max_prop_i (last such row); fallback bkg=3 may fail if true bkg differs (e.g., 1 or 7 in ex2/ex3).

These functions handle clue parsing and seed placement core logic; they seem partially correct but need tuning for pair positions and activation (e.g., color 1 handling).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of propagation and seed placement rules.
 * Train 1: Generated missing 8's in prop rows (e.g., row 9 has 3's instead of 8's at cols 4-5 and 8-9; row 10 similar; row 11 has 3's at 4-5/8-9; row 12 has 3's at 2-3 instead of 8's; row 13 similar; upper block prop not applied correctly, leading to no right-side 8's in early rows).
 * Train 1: Lower prop not triggered (first_clue_color likely 1 or 2, but no right-fill in rows 13-15 from seeds); seeds placed but propagation gaps not filled properly.
 * Train 2: Background detection failed (used 1? but prop extended incorrectly, e.g., row 10 has 8's at 4-5/8-9/14-17 but expected 1's at 4-5; row 11 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 12 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 15 has 8's at 4-5/8-9 but expected 1's; lower prop overfills with 8's where bkg=1 should remain).
 * Train 2: Seeds placed in upper but switched to lower too early or incorrectly; prop in has_prop rows overwrote non-bkg (1's) with 8's in gaps; no handling for color 6 in clues properly.
 * Train 3: Background=7 correct, but seeds misplaced (e.g., row 0 has 8's at 8-9 but expected at 3-4; entire upper structure wrong—no 8's at expected positions like 3-4/19-20; prop in rows 4-6 overfills with 7's instead of 8's; row 7 has 2's at 0-2 but no 8's at 3-4; row 12 has 8's at 12-13 but expected full 8's row; lower rows like 16-18 have 4's starting at col 8 but bkg=7 not propagated correctly).
 * Train 3: Upper block detection failed (no initial all-bkg rows, but prop not applied to right side); lower prop not handled (first_clue_color= ? but no right-fill); pair computation for color 2/4/6 positions off (e.g., special last-group adjustment not triggering correctly).
 * Overall: compute_seed_pairs activates correctly for some colors but pair_start/end positions often wrong (e.g., shifts for color 4 based on next=2 not always accurate; color 1 lower shift to +3 misses cases); has_prop detection works but propagation doesn't stop at non-bkg or handle min/max correctly in all cases; upper/lower switch at max_prop_i too rigid; is_plus1 logic for upper right prop buggy (not triggering when needed); lower_prop_rows hardcoded to first_clue_color but may need more conditions; global 5→bkg works but applied too early, missing some placements.
 * find_background helpful but fallback=3 fails when bkg=1/7/9; get_clue_color useful for group colors.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or connected components attempted—may be needed for verifying prop boundaries, but current code assumes horizontal fills only (unhelpful for vertical or shaped elements).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it retains many unprocessed 5's across rows (e.g., row 0 all 5's; rows 1-4 copy clue-like patterns with 5's and 0's unchanged; row 5 all 5's; rows 6-8 copy 2's and 3's but no 8's placed; rows 9-11 copy 9's and 3's; rows 12-18 mix 1's/9's/3's with some 8's in row 13 cols 8-9 but incomplete; rows 19-24 all 9's or mixed but no systematic 8 propagation or bkg fill).
 * Background not detected/filled (should be 3? based on fallback or uniform rows like row 5/0, but 5's remain everywhere); no seeds placed (clue_row=g[1] has 1 at col1, 3 at10,2 at13,4 at19—should trigger upper pairs at ~cols 2-3 (for1?), 8-9/14-15/20-21? but none appear).
 * Propagation absent (e.g., no 8's extended in potential prop rows; row 13 has isolated 8's but no left/right fill; lower rows like 19-21 have 9's but no right-fill from seeds if first_clue=1).
 * Output seems like a partial copy of input g[6:25] with minimal changes (only some 5→bkg? but many 5's persist; 0's unchanged, which may be invalid—puzzle likely requires full resolution to colors/8/bkg); does not match expected logic (e.g., should place 8 pairs in upper rows based on clues, prop in rows with original 8's like row 13?, fill bkg=3 in empties, preserve 2/9/1/4 blocks).
 * Likely issues: len(g)!=25 check failed or early return; clue parsing missed (0's in groups may skip activation); no has_prop rows detected (input has no original 8's?); upper_block_start not found properly.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 20:37:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 21:05:25] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 21:05:58] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating a Python program containing a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input, following unspecified puzzle rules for interpreting or transforming the grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid elements (e.g., extracting objects, counting features like holes or blobs, matching shapes), but no specific rules are provided—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or omissions based on criteria (e.g., hole counts or stretches across grid).
 * Inputs are grids (List[List[int]]), so code must parse 2D structures accurately; outputs should match expected puzzle solutions, possibly as strings, grids, or classifications.
 * All attempts must demonstrate puzzle understanding through correct handling of training examples before test; failures indicate lack of core structure.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure function signature matches expected (e.g., def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> ...); avoid syntax errors or unrelated code that prevents execution.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle rules extracted yet, so focus on boilerplate structure first; future attempts need functions for grid traversal, object detection (e.g., connected components), and rule application.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function entirely. Placeholder for future use:
```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> list:
    # Example: Identify connected components or blobs in grid
    # (Not implemented; essential for puzzles involving object counting or shape matching)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating the code was incomplete or lacked the entry point.
 * No puzzle logic was executed, so nothing worked—zero progress on visual rules, object extraction, or output generation.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the core requirement (presence of 'program' function), making it entirely unhelpful.
 * No functions like grid parsing or object extraction were present, so none can be salvaged; avoid generating non-functional code without the main function.

**Test output:**

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 21:05:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating a Python program containing a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input, following unspecified puzzle rules for interpreting or transforming the grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid elements (e.g., extracting objects, counting features like holes or blobs, matching shapes), but no specific rules are provided—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or omissions based on criteria (e.g., hole counts or stretches across grid).
 * Inputs are grids (List[List[int]]), so code must parse 2D structures accurately; outputs should match expected puzzle solutions, possibly as strings, grids, or classifications.
 * All attempts must demonstrate puzzle understanding through correct handling of training examples before test; failures indicate lack of core structure.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure function signature matches expected (e.g., def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> ...); avoid syntax errors or unrelated code that prevents execution.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle rules extracted yet, so focus on boilerplate structure first; future attempts need functions for grid traversal, object detection (e.g., connected components), and rule application.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function entirely. Placeholder for future use:
```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> list:
    # Example: Identify connected components or blobs in grid
    # (Not implemented; essential for puzzles involving object counting or shape matching)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating the code was incomplete or lacked the entry point.
 * No puzzle logic was executed, so nothing worked—zero progress on visual rules, object extraction, or output generation.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the core requirement (presence of 'program' function), making it entirely unhelpful.
 * No functions like grid parsing or object extraction were present, so none can be salvaged; avoid generating non-functional code without the main function.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR due to missing 'program' function, so it does not make sense or look correct—it failed before any puzzle processing.
 * No actual output was generated for the test input, making it impossible to verify against expected puzzle solution (e.g., no grid transformation or rule application occurred).
 * This highlights that structural compliance is prerequisite; without it, test handling (e.g., applying rules to the specific test grid) cannot be assessed.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 25-row grid (including clue rows at the top) to generate a 19-row output grid by identifying background colors, placing "seeds" (marked as 8) based on clue interpretations in specific positions and rows, propagating those 8's horizontally in certain "prop" rows (based on original 8 placements or rules), and filling remaining background areas while preserving other colored elements (like 1,2,4,6,9). The goal is to complete incomplete grid sections (marked with 5 as placeholders) according to visual logic rules derived from clues, likely a custom colored fill-in puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bkg) is determined by uniform rows excluding 5's; fallback to 3 if none found—must handle cases where bkg is 1,3,7,9 across examples.
 * Clue row (g[1]) uses groups at positions [1:5,7:11,13:17,19:23]; non-0/5 values indicate colors (1,2,3,4,6) that trigger seed pair placements (consecutive positions for 8's) based on position within group (0 or 3) and color-specific rules (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may shift pair based on next group, color 1 for lower rows shifts differently).
 * Seeds are placed as pairs of 8's in upper rows (0-15, using upper pairs up to max prop row) or lower rows (switching to lower pairs after max prop); only overwrite bkg areas.
 * Propagation of 8's: In rows with original 8's (has_prop), extend left/right from min/max 8 positions and fill gaps between 8's with 8's (assuming bkg in between); subtle: only in rows 0-15, and doesn't overwrite non-bkg.
 * Upper block (initial all-bkg rows) may get right-side propagation of 8's if "plus1" condition (rightmost seed starts at group_start+1) and limited to 2 rows.
 * Lower prop rows depend on first clue color (1→rows 14-15 right-fill from leftmost lower seed; 2→rows 13-14 same); fill rightward from seed start to end if bkg.
 * Replace all 5's with bkg globally after initial copy.
 * Subtleties: Upper/lower seed computation differs (is_lower flag affects activation for color 1 at pos 0); pair starts/ends vary by color/pos (e.g., color 6 at pos 0→start+1; color 2 at pos 3→start+3, special for last group); max_group limits (3 for upper,1 for lower); preserve non-bkg colors (1,2,4,6,9) and don't propagate over them.
 * Grid is 19 output rows x 24 cols; input may have full 25 rows with clues in 0-5? but code uses g[6:25] and g[1] as clue.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only in specific rows; seeds only in bkg areas; rightmost upper prop only if is_plus1 and in upper block; lower prop only if seeds exist and specific first color; no vertical propagation.
 * Other: Original 8's in input determine has_prop and max_prop_i (last such row); fallback bkg=3 may fail if true bkg differs (e.g., 1 or 7 in ex2/ex3).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

```

    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:

                color_pos = p
                color = val
                break
        activate = False
        if color_pos != -1 and color != 3:
            if color_pos == 0:
                if color in [4, 6] or (is_lower and color == 1):

    return seed_pairs
```
These functions handle clue parsing and seed placement core logic; they seem partially correct but need tuning for pair positions and activation (e.g., color 1 handling).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of propagation and seed placement rules.
 * Train 1: Generated missing 8's in prop rows (e.g., row 9 has 3's instead of 8's at cols 4-5 and 8-9; row 10 similar; row 11 has 3's at 4-5/8-9; row 12 has 3's at 2-3 instead of 8's; row 13 similar; upper block prop not applied correctly, leading to no right-side 8's in early rows).
 * Train 1: Lower prop not triggered (first_clue_color likely 1 or 2, but no right-fill in rows 13-15 from seeds); seeds placed but propagation gaps not filled properly.
 * Train 2: Background detection failed (used 1? but prop extended incorrectly, e.g., row 10 has 8's at 4-5/8-9/14-17 but expected 1's at 4-5; row 11 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 12 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 15 has 8's at 4-5/8-9 but expected 1's; lower prop overfills with 8's where bkg=1 should remain).
 * Train 2: Seeds placed in upper but switched to lower too early or incorrectly; prop in has_prop rows overwrote non-bkg (1's) with 8's in gaps; no handling for color 6 in clues properly.
 * Train 3: Background=7 correct, but seeds misplaced (e.g., row 0 has 8's at 8-9 but expected at 3-4; entire upper structure wrong—no 8's at expected positions like 3-4/19-20; prop in rows 4-6 overfills with 7's instead of 8's; row 7 has 2's at 0-2 but no 8's at 3-4; row 12 has 8's at 12-13 but expected full 8's row; lower rows like 16-18 have 4's starting at col 8 but bkg=7 not propagated correctly).
 * Train 3: Upper block detection failed (no initial all-bkg rows, but prop not applied to right side); lower prop not handled (first_clue_color= ? but no right-fill); pair computation for color 2/4/6 positions off (e.g., special last-group adjustment not triggering correctly).
 * Overall: compute_seed_pairs activates correctly for some colors but pair_start/end positions often wrong (e.g., shifts for color 4 based on next=2 not always accurate; color 1 lower shift to +3 misses cases); has_prop detection works but propagation doesn't stop at non-bkg or handle min/max correctly in all cases; upper/lower switch at max_prop_i too rigid; is_plus1 logic for upper right prop buggy (not triggering when needed); lower_prop_rows hardcoded to first_clue_color but may need more conditions; global 5→bkg works but applied too early, missing some placements.
 * find_background helpful but fallback=3 fails when bkg=1/7/9; get_clue_color useful for group colors.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or connected components attempted—may be needed for verifying prop boundaries, but current code assumes horizontal fills only (unhelpful for vertical or shaped elements).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it retains many unprocessed 5's across rows (e.g., row 0 all 5's; rows 1-4 copy clue-like patterns with 5's and 0's unchanged; row 5 all 5's; rows 6-8 copy 2's and 3's but no 8's placed; rows 9-11 copy 9's and 3's; rows 12-18 mix 1's/9's/3's with some 8's in row 13 cols 8-9 but incomplete; rows 19-24 all 9's or mixed but no systematic 8 propagation or bkg fill).
 * Background not detected/filled (should be 3? based on fallback or uniform rows like row 5/0, but 5's remain everywhere); no seeds placed (clue_row=g[1] has 1 at col1, 3 at10,2 at13,4 at19—should trigger upper pairs at ~cols 2-3 (for1?), 8-9/14-15/20-21? but none appear).
 * Propagation absent (e.g., no 8's extended in potential prop rows; row 13 has isolated 8's but no left/right fill; lower rows like 19-21 have 9's but no right-fill from seeds if first_clue=1).
 * Output seems like a partial copy of input g[6:25] with minimal changes (only some 5→bkg? but many 5's persist; 0's unchanged, which may be invalid—puzzle likely requires full resolution to colors/8/bkg); does not match expected logic (e.g., should place 8 pairs in upper rows based on clues, prop in rows with original 8's like row 13?, fill bkg=3 in empties, preserve 2/9/1/4 blocks).
 * Likely issues: len(g)!=25 check failed or early return; clue parsing missed (0's in groups may skip activation); no has_prop rows detected (input has no original 8's?); upper_block_start not found properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input result: ERROR - Program returned invalid grid format: <class 'list'>
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 21:25:29] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 25x24 grid where the goal is to generate a modified 19-row output (rows 6-24 of the input) by detecting a background color, interpreting clues in row 1 to place pairs of "8" elements (representing seeds or props), and applying propagations to fill ranges of 8's based on rules for upper and lower blocks, while replacing 5's with background and handling special cases like right-fills and has-prop rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bkg) is determined by the most common non-0,5,8 value in rows 6+, defaulting to 3 if none; 5's are always replaced by bkg across the output.
 * Clues in row 1 are grouped in 4-cell blocks starting at columns 1,7,13,19; each group has a key color (first non-0/5 value) at a position (0-3) that dictates pair placement for 8's: e.g., position 0 with color 4/6 or (lower and 1) activates left-leaning pairs; position 3 with 2/4/6 activates right-leaning pairs; color 3 skips activation.
 * Upper pairs (for rows 0- max_prop_i in output indexing) are computed from all 4 groups (is_lower=False); lower pairs (for rows max_prop_i+1 to 18) use first group info and original 8-range if present.
 * Propagations: "has_prop" rows (any original 8) fill 8's across min-max 8 columns; right-fill propagates 8's from a start column to end in specific upper/lower blocks; upper block is initial all-bkg rows (up to 2 for right prop); lower prop starts at row 13/14 with 2 rows of fill/propagation based on first color (1/4 triggers pair, 1/2 triggers right-fill, else has-prop).
 * Subtleties: Pair starts/ends vary by color/position (e.g., color 1 pos0 -> start+3; color 2 pos3 -> start+3 but special for last group; color 4 pos0 checks next group's color for +3 vs +1); original 8-range is min-max columns with 8 in rows 6-24; max_prop_i is highest has_prop row index; rightmost upper pair determines if +1 offset for right_fill_start; lower left_fill_start from first pair or original min.
 * Easy to miss: First group handles color 1 specially for lower; lower prop num=2 but clipped to 19; pairs only placed if activated and color !=3; output copies input rows 6-24 then modifies; invalid input returns empty list.
 * Across attempts: No full successes; common issues include over-placing 8's in non-prop areas, missing full range fills (e.g., not expanding to connect 8's properly), incorrect pair positions based on clue logic, and failing to handle block transitions (upper to lower) or special fills (right/left).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = Counter()
    for row in grid[6:]:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in [0, 5, 8]:
                count[cell] += 1
    return max(count, key=count.get) if count else 3
```
(This correctly identifies bkg by frequency, excluding specials; useful for all cases.)

```python
def get_clue_color(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> int:
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val
    return 0
```
(Extracts key color per group; helpful for pair logic, especially cross-group checks like color 4 pos0.)

```python
def get_original_eight_range(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_col = 24
    max_col = -1
    for i in range(6, 25):
        row = grid[i]
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 8:
                min_col = min(min_col, j)
                max_col = max(max_col, j)
    return min_col, max_col if max_col >= 0 else (0, -1)
```
(Finds global min-max 8 columns for lower pairs/propagations; essential for cases with pre-existing 8's.)

```python
def find_has_prop_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    has_prop = []
    for i in range(19):
        row = grid[6 + i]
        if any(cell == 8 for cell in row):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Identifies rows needing has-prop fill; useful but needs integration with max_prop_i for block split.)

```python
def propagate_has_prop(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    eight_cols = [j for j, cell in enumerate(new_row) if cell == 8]
    if not eight_cols:
        return new_row
    min_j = min(eight_cols)
    max_j = max(eight_cols)
    for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
        if new_row[j] == bkg:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```
(Fills gaps between min-max 8's in a row; core for has-prop, but unhelpful if applied too broadly without 8's present.)

```python
def is_all_bkg_row(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> bool:
    return all(cell == bkg for cell in row)
```
(Detects pure bkg rows for upper block end; helpful for limiting initial placements.)

The `compute_seed_pairs` and `get_first_group_info` functions are partially helpful for pair extraction but buggy (e.g., incomplete activation logic, special cases like gi=3 for color 2 mishandled); `place_seeds` is straightforward but overused without checks. Overall program structure (copy output, replace 5's, place then propagate) is a good skeleton but fails on block transitions and specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, bkg detection, and pair placement but fails all training examples due to incorrect propagations and pair positions.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8's in rows 7-8 (full middle fill too early) and row 9 (8's at 4-5 instead of connecting properly); missed full connection in row 7-8 (expected 0-3 as 1's unchanged, but placed 8's wrongly); lower rows 14-16 overfilled with 8's instead of partial; rows 16-18 correct for 2's but upper mismatches blob shapes (unknown why, possibly wrong upper_pairs or prop range).
 * Train 2: Generated wrong 8-range in row 2 (8's at 14-17 instead of 14-23 full); missed full 8-propagation in rows 2-3 (expected 8's to 23); row 5 has extra 8's at 16-17 where expected 1's; row 14 has 8's at 8-15 instead of none; row 15 partial 8's missing; lower rows 16-18 correct but upper prop fails to connect properly (e.g., row 8-9 should connect more).
 * Train 3: Generated wrong initial 8's in row 0-2 (3's at 8-17 instead of 8's? Wait, expected has 8's at 18-19 but generated 3's there initially?); rows 4-6 have 8's at 8-17 but expected full 0-4 8's in row 4; row 12 has 8's at 5-13 but expected none/more specific; row 13 overfills 8's at 5-13; row 14 partial but misses full 14-23 8's; lower row 16-18 has 7's at 3-4 instead of none, and 4's start too early without full prop.
 * Common misses: Over-placement of 8's in non-activated areas; incorrect block split (max_prop_i too low/high, leading to wrong upper/lower pairs); right-fill applied wrongly (e.g., starts too early or not at all); lower prop start/num hardcoded poorly (14 for 1/4 but affects fills); original 8-range not always used for lower pairs; has_prop applied universally instead of selectively.
 * Function `propagate_lower_prop_right_fill` is helpful for right-fills but unhelpful when misapplied (e.g., fills from wrong start, overfills empty rows).
 * Function `get_first_group_info` is broken for some colors (e.g., doesn't handle pos0 color=4/6 fully, leading to wrong lower pairs in Train 1/2).
 * Overall, attempt shows core structure but lacks precise clue-to-pair mapping and prop conditions; unhelpful to reuse raw `program` without fixes to activation and block logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an ERROR (invalid grid format: returned <class 'list'> instead of proper 19x24 List[List[int]]), indicating a crash likely from unhandled input dimensions, empty pairs, or index errors in propagation (e.g., pair_end >23 or max_prop_i invalid).
 * No generated grid to evaluate, but based on training failures, it would likely mismatch by over/under-placing 8's, wrong bkg replacement, or failed propagations (e.g., missing connections in has-prop rows or incorrect lower fills); does not look correct as it didn't produce output at all—must fix input validation and edge cases like no 8's or unusual clue colors to handle test.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 21:25:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating a Python program containing a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input, following unspecified puzzle rules for interpreting or transforming the grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid elements (e.g., extracting objects, counting features like holes or blobs, matching shapes), but no specific rules are provided—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or omissions based on criteria (e.g., hole counts or stretches across grid).
 * Inputs are grids (List[List[int]]), so code must parse 2D structures accurately; outputs should match expected puzzle solutions, possibly as strings, grids, or classifications.
 * All attempts must demonstrate puzzle understanding through correct handling of training examples before test; failures indicate lack of core structure.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure function signature matches expected (e.g., def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> ...); avoid syntax errors or unrelated code that prevents execution.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle rules extracted yet, so focus on boilerplate structure first; future attempts need functions for grid traversal, object detection (e.g., connected components), and rule application.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function entirely. Placeholder for future use:
```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> list:
    # Example: Identify connected components or blobs in grid
    # (Not implemented; essential for puzzles involving object counting or shape matching)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating the code was incomplete or lacked the entry point.
 * No puzzle logic was executed, so nothing worked—zero progress on visual rules, object extraction, or output generation.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the core requirement (presence of 'program' function), making it entirely unhelpful.
 * No functions like grid parsing or object extraction were present, so none can be salvaged; avoid generating non-functional code without the main function.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR due to missing 'program' function, so it does not make sense or look correct—it failed before any puzzle processing.
 * No actual output was generated for the test input, making it impossible to verify against expected puzzle solution (e.g., no grid transformation or rule application occurred).
 * This highlights that structural compliance is prerequisite; without it, test handling (e.g., applying rules to the specific test grid) cannot be assessed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 25-row grid (including clue rows at the top) to generate a 19-row output grid by identifying background colors, placing "seeds" (marked as 8) based on clue interpretations in specific positions and rows, propagating those 8's horizontally in certain "prop" rows (based on original 8 placements or rules), and filling remaining background areas while preserving other colored elements (like 1,2,4,6,9). The goal is to complete incomplete grid sections (marked with 5 as placeholders) according to visual logic rules derived from clues, likely a custom colored fill-in puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bkg) is determined by uniform rows excluding 5's; fallback to 3 if none found—must handle cases where bkg is 1,3,7,9 across examples.
 * Clue row (g[1]) uses groups at positions [1:5,7:11,13:17,19:23]; non-0/5 values indicate colors (1,2,3,4,6) that trigger seed pair placements (consecutive positions for 8's) based on position within group (0 or 3) and color-specific rules (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may shift pair based on next group, color 1 for lower rows shifts differently).
 * Seeds are placed as pairs of 8's in upper rows (0-15, using upper pairs up to max prop row) or lower rows (switching to lower pairs after max prop); only overwrite bkg areas.
 * Propagation of 8's: In rows with original 8's (has_prop), extend left/right from min/max 8 positions and fill gaps between 8's with 8's (assuming bkg in between); subtle: only in rows 0-15, and doesn't overwrite non-bkg.
 * Upper block (initial all-bkg rows) may get right-side propagation of 8's if "plus1" condition (rightmost seed starts at group_start+1) and limited to 2 rows.
 * Lower prop rows depend on first clue color (1→rows 14-15 right-fill from leftmost lower seed; 2→rows 13-14 same); fill rightward from seed start to end if bkg.
 * Replace all 5's with bkg globally after initial copy.
 * Subtleties: Upper/lower seed computation differs (is_lower flag affects activation for color 1 at pos 0); pair starts/ends vary by color/pos (e.g., color 6 at pos 0→start+1; color 2 at pos 3→start+3, special for last group); max_group limits (3 for upper,1 for lower); preserve non-bkg colors (1,2,4,6,9) and don't propagate over them.
 * Grid is 19 output rows x 24 cols; input may have full 25 rows with clues in 0-5? but code uses g[6:25] and g[1] as clue.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only in specific rows; seeds only in bkg areas; rightmost upper prop only if is_plus1 and in upper block; lower prop only if seeds exist and specific first color; no vertical propagation.
 * Other: Original 8's in input determine has_prop and max_prop_i (last such row); fallback bkg=3 may fail if true bkg differs (e.g., 1 or 7 in ex2/ex3).

    return seed_pairs
```
These functions handle clue parsing and seed placement core logic; they seem partially correct but need tuning for pair positions and activation (e.g., color 1 handling).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of propagation and seed placement rules.
 * Train 1: Generated missing 8's in prop rows (e.g., row 9 has 3's instead of 8's at cols 4-5 and 8-9; row 10 similar; row 11 has 3's at 4-5/8-9; row 12 has 3's at 2-3 instead of 8's; row 13 similar; upper block prop not applied correctly, leading to no right-side 8's in early rows).
 * Train 1: Lower prop not triggered (first_clue_color likely 1 or 2, but no right-fill in rows 13-15 from seeds); seeds placed but propagation gaps not filled properly.
 * Train 2: Background detection failed (used 1? but prop extended incorrectly, e.g., row 10 has 8's at 4-5/8-9/14-17 but expected 1's at 4-5; row 11 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 12 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 15 has 8's at 4-5/8-9 but expected 1's; lower prop overfills with 8's where bkg=1 should remain).
 * Train 2: Seeds placed in upper but switched to lower too early or incorrectly; prop in has_prop rows overwrote non-bkg (1's) with 8's in gaps; no handling for color 6 in clues properly.
 * Train 3: Background=7 correct, but seeds misplaced (e.g., row 0 has 8's at 8-9 but expected at 3-4; entire upper structure wrong—no 8's at expected positions like 3-4/19-20; prop in rows 4-6 overfills with 7's instead of 8's; row 7 has 2's at 0-2 but no 8's at 3-4; row 12 has 8's at 12-13 but expected full 8's row; lower rows like 16-18 have 4's starting at col 8 but bkg=7 not propagated correctly).
 * Train 3: Upper block detection failed (no initial all-bkg rows, but prop not applied to right side); lower prop not handled (first_clue_color= ? but no right-fill); pair computation for color 2/4/6 positions off (e.g., special last-group adjustment not triggering correctly).
 * Overall: compute_seed_pairs activates correctly for some colors but pair_start/end positions often wrong (e.g., shifts for color 4 based on next=2 not always accurate; color 1 lower shift to +3 misses cases); has_prop detection works but propagation doesn't stop at non-bkg or handle min/max correctly in all cases; upper/lower switch at max_prop_i too rigid; is_plus1 logic for upper right prop buggy (not triggering when needed); lower_prop_rows hardcoded to first_clue_color but may need more conditions; global 5→bkg works but applied too early, missing some placements.
 * find_background helpful but fallback=3 fails when bkg=1/7/9; get_clue_color useful for group colors.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or connected components attempted—may be needed for verifying prop boundaries, but current code assumes horizontal fills only (unhelpful for vertical or shaped elements).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it retains many unprocessed 5's across rows (e.g., row 0 all 5's; rows 1-4 copy clue-like patterns with 5's and 0's unchanged; row 5 all 5's; rows 6-8 copy 2's and 3's but no 8's placed; rows 9-11 copy 9's and 3's; rows 12-18 mix 1's/9's/3's with some 8's in row 13 cols 8-9 but incomplete; rows 19-24 all 9's or mixed but no systematic 8 propagation or bkg fill).
 * Background not detected/filled (should be 3? based on fallback or uniform rows like row 5/0, but 5's remain everywhere); no seeds placed (clue_row=g[1] has 1 at col1, 3 at10,2 at13,4 at19—should trigger upper pairs at ~cols 2-3 (for1?), 8-9/14-15/20-21? but none appear).
 * Propagation absent (e.g., no 8's extended in potential prop rows; row 13 has isolated 8's but no left/right fill; lower rows like 19-21 have 9's but no right-fill from seeds if first_clue=1).
 * Output seems like a partial copy of input g[6:25] with minimal changes (only some 5→bkg? but many 5's persist; 0's unchanged, which may be invalid—puzzle likely requires full resolution to colors/8/bkg); does not match expected logic (e.g., should place 8 pairs in upper rows based on clues, prop in rows with original 8's like row 13?, fill bkg=3 in empties, preserve 2/9/1/4 blocks).
 * Likely issues: len(g)!=25 check failed or early return; clue parsing missed (0's in groups may skip activation); no has_prop rows detected (input has no original 8's?); upper_block_start not found properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 25x24 grid where the goal is to generate a modified 19-row output (rows 6-24 of the input) by detecting a background color, interpreting clues in row 1 to place pairs of "8" elements (representing seeds or props), and applying propagations to fill ranges of 8's based on rules for upper and lower blocks, while replacing 5's with background and handling special cases like right-fills and has-prop rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bkg) is determined by the most common non-0,5,8 value in rows 6+, defaulting to 3 if none; 5's are always replaced by bkg across the output.
 * Clues in row 1 are grouped in 4-cell blocks starting at columns 1,7,13,19; each group has a key color (first non-0/5 value) at a position (0-3) that dictates pair placement for 8's: e.g., position 0 with color 4/6 or (lower and 1) activates left-leaning pairs; position 3 with 2/4/6 activates right-leaning pairs; color 3 skips activation.
 * Upper pairs (for rows 0- max_prop_i in output indexing) are computed from all 4 groups (is_lower=False); lower pairs (for rows max_prop_i+1 to 18) use first group info and original 8-range if present.
 * Propagations: "has_prop" rows (any original 8) fill 8's across min-max 8 columns; right-fill propagates 8's from a start column to end in specific upper/lower blocks; upper block is initial all-bkg rows (up to 2 for right prop); lower prop starts at row 13/14 with 2 rows of fill/propagation based on first color (1/4 triggers pair, 1/2 triggers right-fill, else has-prop).
 * Subtleties: Pair starts/ends vary by color/position (e.g., color 1 pos0 -> start+3; color 2 pos3 -> start+3 but special for last group; color 4 pos0 checks next group's color for +3 vs +1); original 8-range is min-max columns with 8 in rows 6-24; max_prop_i is highest has_prop row index; rightmost upper pair determines if +1 offset for right_fill_start; lower left_fill_start from first pair or original min.
 * Easy to miss: First group handles color 1 specially for lower; lower prop num=2 but clipped to 19; pairs only placed if activated and color !=3; output copies input rows 6-24 then modifies; invalid input returns empty list.
 * Across attempts: No full successes; common issues include over-placing 8's in non-prop areas, missing full range fills (e.g., not expanding to connect 8's properly), incorrect pair positions based on clue logic, and failing to handle block transitions (upper to lower) or special fills (right/left).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = Counter()
    for row in grid[6:]:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in [0, 5, 8]:
                count[cell] += 1
    return max(count, key=count.get) if count else 3
```
(This correctly identifies bkg by frequency, excluding specials; useful for all cases.)

```python
def get_clue_color(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> int:
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val
    return 0
```
(Extracts key color per group; helpful for pair logic, especially cross-group checks like color 4 pos0.)

```python
def get_original_eight_range(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_col = 24
    max_col = -1
    for i in range(6, 25):
        row = grid[i]
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 8:
                min_col = min(min_col, j)
                max_col = max(max_col, j)
    return min_col, max_col if max_col >= 0 else (0, -1)
```
(Finds global min-max 8 columns for lower pairs/propagations; essential for cases with pre-existing 8's.)

```python
def find_has_prop_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    has_prop = []
    for i in range(19):
        row = grid[6 + i]
        if any(cell == 8 for cell in row):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Identifies rows needing has-prop fill; useful but needs integration with max_prop_i for block split.)

```python
def propagate_has_prop(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    eight_cols = [j for j, cell in enumerate(new_row) if cell == 8]
    if not eight_cols:
        return new_row
    min_j = min(eight_cols)
    max_j = max(eight_cols)
    for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
        if new_row[j] == bkg:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```
(Fills gaps between min-max 8's in a row; core for has-prop, but unhelpful if applied too broadly without 8's present.)

```python
def is_all_bkg_row(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> bool:
    return all(cell == bkg for cell in row)
```
(Detects pure bkg rows for upper block end; helpful for limiting initial placements.)

The `compute_seed_pairs` and `get_first_group_info` functions are partially helpful for pair extraction but buggy (e.g., incomplete activation logic, special cases like gi=3 for color 2 mishandled); `place_seeds` is straightforward but overused without checks. Overall program structure (copy output, replace 5's, place then propagate) is a good skeleton but fails on block transitions and specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, bkg detection, and pair placement but fails all training examples due to incorrect propagations and pair positions.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8's in rows 7-8 (full middle fill too early) and row 9 (8's at 4-5 instead of connecting properly); missed full connection in row 7-8 (expected 0-3 as 1's unchanged, but placed 8's wrongly); lower rows 14-16 overfilled with 8's instead of partial; rows 16-18 correct for 2's but upper mismatches blob shapes (unknown why, possibly wrong upper_pairs or prop range).
 * Train 2: Generated wrong 8-range in row 2 (8's at 14-17 instead of 14-23 full); missed full 8-propagation in rows 2-3 (expected 8's to 23); row 5 has extra 8's at 16-17 where expected 1's; row 14 has 8's at 8-15 instead of none; row 15 partial 8's missing; lower rows 16-18 correct but upper prop fails to connect properly (e.g., row 8-9 should connect more).
 * Train 3: Generated wrong initial 8's in row 0-2 (3's at 8-17 instead of 8's? Wait, expected has 8's at 18-19 but generated 3's there initially?); rows 4-6 have 8's at 8-17 but expected full 0-4 8's in row 4; row 12 has 8's at 5-13 but expected none/more specific; row 13 overfills 8's at 5-13; row 14 partial but misses full 14-23 8's; lower row 16-18 has 7's at 3-4 instead of none, and 4's start too early without full prop.
 * Common misses: Over-placement of 8's in non-activated areas; incorrect block split (max_prop_i too low/high, leading to wrong upper/lower pairs); right-fill applied wrongly (e.g., starts too early or not at all); lower prop start/num hardcoded poorly (14 for 1/4 but affects fills); original 8-range not always used for lower pairs; has_prop applied universally instead of selectively.
 * Function `propagate_lower_prop_right_fill` is helpful for right-fills but unhelpful when misapplied (e.g., fills from wrong start, overfills empty rows).
 * Function `get_first_group_info` is broken for some colors (e.g., doesn't handle pos0 color=4/6 fully, leading to wrong lower pairs in Train 1/2).
 * Overall, attempt shows core structure but lacks precise clue-to-pair mapping and prop conditions; unhelpful to reuse raw `program` without fixes to activation and block logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an ERROR (invalid grid format: returned <class 'list'> instead of proper 19x24 List[List[int]]), indicating a crash likely from unhandled input dimensions, empty pairs, or index errors in propagation (e.g., pair_end >23 or max_prop_i invalid).
 * No generated grid to evaluate, but based on training failures, it would likely mismatch by over/under-placing 8's, wrong bkg replacement, or failed propagations (e.g., missing connections in has-prop rows or incorrect lower fills); does not look correct as it didn't produce output at all—must fix input validation and edge cases like no 8's or unusual clue colors to handle test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 21:41:59] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a 25-row by 24-column grid where rows 6-24 represent a drawable area with a background color, existing "8" elements (likely props or paint to propagate), and clues in upper rows (e.g., row 1) that dictate pair placements and fills of "8"s in upper (top ~half) and lower (bottom ~half) sections. The goal is to propagate and fill "8"s based on clue-derived rules for pairs, gaps, special connections, and background replacement, while preserving non-background elements like colored blocks (1-7,9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection: Scan rows 6-24, count non-0/5/8 cells, pick most common as background (default 3); replace all 5's with it. Subtle: Ignores 0/5/8 to avoid miscounting empties/props/specials, but may fail if background is rare or tied to clues.
 * Clue row parsing: Clues in row 1, divided into 4 groups of 4 cells (starts at indices 1,7,13,19). Each group has a "color" (non-0/5 value) and "position" (0-3 offset where color appears). Color=0 or 3 skips group; others trigger pair starts based on color/pos combos (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may depend on next group's color). Subtle: Last group (start 19) has edge case for pos=3/color=2 shifting to 18; pairs are always 2-wide (start to start+1), but computation varies (e.g., color 6 at pos 0 -> start+1; color 4 at pos 3 -> start+2).
 * Upper vs. lower sections: Upper is rows 0 to max_prop_i (index of last row with original 8's); lower is after. Place pairs as 8's only if the slot is all-background. Subtle: Upper uses multiple pairs from all groups; lower uses single pair from first group (with extra color=1 case at pos=0 -> start+3) or original 8-range if no special lower condition.
 * Original 8's range: Find min/max col with 8's in rows 6-24; used for lower fills if not special. Subtle: If no 8's, defaults to (24,-1) which skips.
 * Has_prop rows: Rows (0-18 relative) with any original 8; after placing pairs/seeds, fill gaps between min/max 8 in that row with 8's (connect blobs horizontally).
 * Special lower fills: For rows 14-15 (absolute 20-21?) if first group color in {1,2,4}, connect existing 8's to a target range (e.g., color=1 -> to col 23; color=2 -> from min_col to 23; color=4 -> from leftmost 8 to min_col). Subtle: Only if min_col <24 and 8's exist; applied after seeds but before/in gap fill? Order matters for connections.
 * Right fill upper: If upper pairs exist, find rightmost pair start; if it matches a computed group position and is at group_start+1, fill from that col to 24 with 8's—but only in the FIRST all-background row up to max_prop_i. Subtle: Only activates for specific cases (e.g., gi !=-1 and exact pos); seems to target a "spillover" but only once, which may miss multi-row propagation.
 * Propagation order: Replace 5's first -> compute pairs/ranges -> place seeds in upper/lower -> gap fill in has_prop rows -> special lower fills. Subtle: Gap fill only in has_prop (not all rows), and special lower overrides/reconnects based on color; no vertical propagation, only horizontal connects/fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty pairs/ranges skip; indices 0-23 cols; output is rows 6-24 modified. Subtle: Lower special skips if color not in [1,2,4]; background may be non-3 (e.g., 1 or 7 in examples); clues may have 0/5 as fillers.
 * General: Preserve non-bkg/non-8 (e.g., 1-4,6,7,9 blocks); no overwriting existing 8's; fills only on bkg slots.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = Counter()
    for row in grid[6:25]:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in [0, 5, 8]:
                count[cell] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 3
```
(Helpful: Correctly detects dominant non-empty/prop color as bkg; used in all placements.)

```python
def get_group_info(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val, p
    return 0, -1
```
(Helpful: Extracts color/pos from 4-cell group; core for pair computation; handles fillers.)

```python
def get_original_eight_range(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_col = 24
    max_col = -1
    for row in grid[6:25]:
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 8:
                min_col = min(min_col, j)
                max_col = max(max_col, j)
    return min_col, max_col if max_col >= 0 else (24, -1)

def get_has_prop_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    has_prop = []
    for i in range(19):
        if any(cell == 8 for cell in grid[6 + i]):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Helpful: Finds global 8-range for lower seeds; identifies rows needing gap fills. Essential for sectioning upper/lower and connecting.)

```python
def get_first_color(clue_row: List[int]) -> int:
    return get_group_info(clue_row, 1)[0]
```
(Helpful: Quick first-group color for special lower trigger.)

The pair computation functions (compute_upper_pairs, compute_lower_pair) are partially helpful for deriving 2-wide starts from clues but buggy (see below; overcomplicated logic misses cases). apply_right_fill_upper is unhelpful/broken (only fills one row, specific pos, doesn't propagate). Gap fill logic in main loop is helpful but limited to has_prop rows only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/only attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, background, and horizontal fills but fails all trainings due to incomplete propagation.
 * Train 1: Generated correctly places some upper pairs (e.g., 8,8 at cols 8-9 and 16-17 in early rows) and lower 2's/4's, detects bkg=3, but misses full connections in has_prop rows (e.g., row 7: generated has 8's only at 4-5? Wait, actually generated row7 [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,3,3] but expected starts 8's at col0; diff: generated delays left-fill until row8, and row11 has extra 3's vs expected 8's? Unknown why partial gap fill). Also, row12 generated has 8's at 0-1 but expected none there; special lower not triggering full right-fill in rows 14-16. Right fill didn't activate.
 * Train 2: Generated places upper pairs correctly in some rows (e.g., 8,8 at 4-5,8-9), bkg=1, but misses extending 8's in lower non-special rows (e.g., row3: generated 8's only partial vs expected full 13-23; row14: generated no 8's vs expected full connect). Lower pair computation wrong (places at wrong pos for color=6?). Special lower (rows16-18 with 4's) correct but upstream misses prevent full blobs. Gap fill skips non-has_prop or doesn't connect to min_col properly.
 * Train 3: Generated bkg=7 correctly, places some 8's (e.g., 3-4,18-19 pairs), but misses vertical consistency and full upper connects (e.g., row4: generated 8's at 8-9 but expected full 0-23 except edges; row5-6 similar partial). Has_prop gap fill incomplete (e.g., row11: generated connects some but leaves gaps at 8-17 vs expected full). Lower special not handled (rows16-18: generated 4's start at col8 but expected from col3; unknown pos miscalc). Right fill absent. Edge: row14 generated partial 8's vs expected more connects.
 * Overall: Pair logic over-relies on pos/color combos, missing spillover (e.g., color4 depending on next group often wrong). Gap fill only horizontal/per-row, no multi-row or full-section flood. Special lower misfires (wrong leftmost/to_col for colors). apply_right_fill_upper unhelpful (too narrow, only one row, didn't trigger in any train). No vertical propagation, leading to fragmented 8's. compute_lower_pair adds color=1 case but buggy (pos=0/1 overlap?). Program preserves colors well but under-fills 8's systematically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it seems to mishandle background (fills early rows 0-2 with 2's, but if bkg=3 at end, why 2's? Possible clue color leak or wrong bkg detect—clues may have 2's dominating count). Upper pairs/seeds partial (e.g., row7 has 8's at 8-10 but fragmented with 9's; expected smoother connects based on trains). Has_prop gap fill inconsistent (e.g., row13: 8's scattered with 9's gaps vs expected solid blobs). Lower special likely wrong (rows17-18: 4's at 7-15 but 8's/9's around; if first_color=4, should connect to min_col=3? but mixes with 9's). Ends with 9's, suggesting bkg=9 or un-replaced, but trains show preservation—output has too many isolated 8's and no full right-fills. Doesn't match train patterns (e.g., no solid lower 8-range); likely misses clue-dependent pairs and over-relies on original 8's which may be sparse. Unknown test clues/grid, but fragmented 8's/9's suggest broken pair computation or gap fill not extending to edges.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 21:41:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating a Python program containing a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input, following unspecified puzzle rules for interpreting or transforming the grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid elements (e.g., extracting objects, counting features like holes or blobs, matching shapes), but no specific rules are provided—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or omissions based on criteria (e.g., hole counts or stretches across grid).
 * Inputs are grids (List[List[int]]), so code must parse 2D structures accurately; outputs should match expected puzzle solutions, possibly as strings, grids, or classifications.
 * All attempts must demonstrate puzzle understanding through correct handling of training examples before test; failures indicate lack of core structure.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure function signature matches expected (e.g., def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> ...); avoid syntax errors or unrelated code that prevents execution.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle rules extracted yet, so focus on boilerplate structure first; future attempts need functions for grid traversal, object detection (e.g., connected components), and rule application.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function entirely. Placeholder for future use:
```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> list:
    # Example: Identify connected components or blobs in grid
    # (Not implemented; essential for puzzles involving object counting or shape matching)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating the code was incomplete or lacked the entry point.
 * No puzzle logic was executed, so nothing worked—zero progress on visual rules, object extraction, or output generation.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the core requirement (presence of 'program' function), making it entirely unhelpful.
 * No functions like grid parsing or object extraction were present, so none can be salvaged; avoid generating non-functional code without the main function.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR due to missing 'program' function, so it does not make sense or look correct—it failed before any puzzle processing.
 * No actual output was generated for the test input, making it impossible to verify against expected puzzle solution (e.g., no grid transformation or rule application occurred).
 * This highlights that structural compliance is prerequisite; without it, test handling (e.g., applying rules to the specific test grid) cannot be assessed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 25-row grid (including clue rows at the top) to generate a 19-row output grid by identifying background colors, placing "seeds" (marked as 8) based on clue interpretations in specific positions and rows, propagating those 8's horizontally in certain "prop" rows (based on original 8 placements or rules), and filling remaining background areas while preserving other colored elements (like 1,2,4,6,9). The goal is to complete incomplete grid sections (marked with 5 as placeholders) according to visual logic rules derived from clues, likely a custom colored fill-in puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bkg) is determined by uniform rows excluding 5's; fallback to 3 if none found—must handle cases where bkg is 1,3,7,9 across examples.
 * Clue row (g[1]) uses groups at positions [1:5,7:11,13:17,19:23]; non-0/5 values indicate colors (1,2,3,4,6) that trigger seed pair placements (consecutive positions for 8's) based on position within group (0 or 3) and color-specific rules (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may shift pair based on next group, color 1 for lower rows shifts differently).
 * Seeds are placed as pairs of 8's in upper rows (0-15, using upper pairs up to max prop row) or lower rows (switching to lower pairs after max prop); only overwrite bkg areas.
 * Propagation of 8's: In rows with original 8's (has_prop), extend left/right from min/max 8 positions and fill gaps between 8's with 8's (assuming bkg in between); subtle: only in rows 0-15, and doesn't overwrite non-bkg.
 * Upper block (initial all-bkg rows) may get right-side propagation of 8's if "plus1" condition (rightmost seed starts at group_start+1) and limited to 2 rows.
 * Lower prop rows depend on first clue color (1→rows 14-15 right-fill from leftmost lower seed; 2→rows 13-14 same); fill rightward from seed start to end if bkg.
 * Replace all 5's with bkg globally after initial copy.
 * Subtleties: Upper/lower seed computation differs (is_lower flag affects activation for color 1 at pos 0); pair starts/ends vary by color/pos (e.g., color 6 at pos 0→start+1; color 2 at pos 3→start+3, special for last group); max_group limits (3 for upper,1 for lower); preserve non-bkg colors (1,2,4,6,9) and don't propagate over them.
 * Grid is 19 output rows x 24 cols; input may have full 25 rows with clues in 0-5? but code uses g[6:25] and g[1] as clue.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only in specific rows; seeds only in bkg areas; rightmost upper prop only if is_plus1 and in upper block; lower prop only if seeds exist and specific first color; no vertical propagation.
 * Other: Original 8's in input determine has_prop and max_prop_i (last such row); fallback bkg=3 may fail if true bkg differs (e.g., 1 or 7 in ex2/ex3).

        if pair_end < 24:
            seed_pairs.append((pair_start, pair_end))
    return seed_pairs
```
These functions handle clue parsing and seed placement core logic; they seem partially correct but need tuning for pair positions and activation (e.g., color 1 handling).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of propagation and seed placement rules.
 * Train 1: Generated missing 8's in prop rows (e.g., row 9 has 3's instead of 8's at cols 4-5 and 8-9; row 10 similar; row 11 has 3's at 4-5/8-9; row 12 has 3's at 2-3 instead of 8's; row 13 similar; upper block prop not applied correctly, leading to no right-side 8's in early rows).
 * Train 1: Lower prop not triggered (first_clue_color likely 1 or 2, but no right-fill in rows 13-15 from seeds); seeds placed but propagation gaps not filled properly.
 * Train 2: Background detection failed (used 1? but prop extended incorrectly, e.g., row 10 has 8's at 4-5/8-9/14-17 but expected 1's at 4-5; row 11 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 12 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 15 has 8's at 4-5/8-9 but expected 1's; lower prop overfills with 8's where bkg=1 should remain).
 * Train 2: Seeds placed in upper but switched to lower too early or incorrectly; prop in has_prop rows overwrote non-bkg (1's) with 8's in gaps; no handling for color 6 in clues properly.
 * Train 3: Background=7 correct, but seeds misplaced (e.g., row 0 has 8's at 8-9 but expected at 3-4; entire upper structure wrong—no 8's at expected positions like 3-4/19-20; prop in rows 4-6 overfills with 7's instead of 8's; row 7 has 2's at 0-2 but no 8's at 3-4; row 12 has 8's at 12-13 but expected full 8's row; lower rows like 16-18 have 4's starting at col 8 but bkg=7 not propagated correctly).
 * Train 3: Upper block detection failed (no initial all-bkg rows, but prop not applied to right side); lower prop not handled (first_clue_color= ? but no right-fill); pair computation for color 2/4/6 positions off (e.g., special last-group adjustment not triggering correctly).
 * Overall: compute_seed_pairs activates correctly for some colors but pair_start/end positions often wrong (e.g., shifts for color 4 based on next=2 not always accurate; color 1 lower shift to +3 misses cases); has_prop detection works but propagation doesn't stop at non-bkg or handle min/max correctly in all cases; upper/lower switch at max_prop_i too rigid; is_plus1 logic for upper right prop buggy (not triggering when needed); lower_prop_rows hardcoded to first_clue_color but may need more conditions; global 5→bkg works but applied too early, missing some placements.
 * find_background helpful but fallback=3 fails when bkg=1/7/9; get_clue_color useful for group colors.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or connected components attempted—may be needed for verifying prop boundaries, but current code assumes horizontal fills only (unhelpful for vertical or shaped elements).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it retains many unprocessed 5's across rows (e.g., row 0 all 5's; rows 1-4 copy clue-like patterns with 5's and 0's unchanged; row 5 all 5's; rows 6-8 copy 2's and 3's but no 8's placed; rows 9-11 copy 9's and 3's; rows 12-18 mix 1's/9's/3's with some 8's in row 13 cols 8-9 but incomplete; rows 19-24 all 9's or mixed but no systematic 8 propagation or bkg fill).
 * Background not detected/filled (should be 3? based on fallback or uniform rows like row 5/0, but 5's remain everywhere); no seeds placed (clue_row=g[1] has 1 at col1, 3 at10,2 at13,4 at19—should trigger upper pairs at ~cols 2-3 (for1?), 8-9/14-15/20-21? but none appear).
 * Propagation absent (e.g., no 8's extended in potential prop rows; row 13 has isolated 8's but no left/right fill; lower rows like 19-21 have 9's but no right-fill from seeds if first_clue=1).
 * Output seems like a partial copy of input g[6:25] with minimal changes (only some 5→bkg? but many 5's persist; 0's unchanged, which may be invalid—puzzle likely requires full resolution to colors/8/bkg); does not match expected logic (e.g., should place 8 pairs in upper rows based on clues, prop in rows with original 8's like row 13?, fill bkg=3 in empties, preserve 2/9/1/4 blocks).
 * Likely issues: len(g)!=25 check failed or early return; clue parsing missed (0's in groups may skip activation); no has_prop rows detected (input has no original 8's?); upper_block_start not found properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 25x24 grid where the goal is to generate a modified 19-row output (rows 6-24 of the input) by detecting a background color, interpreting clues in row 1 to place pairs of "8" elements (representing seeds or props), and applying propagations to fill ranges of 8's based on rules for upper and lower blocks, while replacing 5's with background and handling special cases like right-fills and has-prop rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bkg) is determined by the most common non-0,5,8 value in rows 6+, defaulting to 3 if none; 5's are always replaced by bkg across the output.
 * Clues in row 1 are grouped in 4-cell blocks starting at columns 1,7,13,19; each group has a key color (first non-0/5 value) at a position (0-3) that dictates pair placement for 8's: e.g., position 0 with color 4/6 or (lower and 1) activates left-leaning pairs; position 3 with 2/4/6 activates right-leaning pairs; color 3 skips activation.
 * Upper pairs (for rows 0- max_prop_i in output indexing) are computed from all 4 groups (is_lower=False); lower pairs (for rows max_prop_i+1 to 18) use first group info and original 8-range if present.
 * Propagations: "has_prop" rows (any original 8) fill 8's across min-max 8 columns; right-fill propagates 8's from a start column to end in specific upper/lower blocks; upper block is initial all-bkg rows (up to 2 for right prop); lower prop starts at row 13/14 with 2 rows of fill/propagation based on first color (1/4 triggers pair, 1/2 triggers right-fill, else has-prop).
 * Subtleties: Pair starts/ends vary by color/position (e.g., color 1 pos0 -> start+3; color 2 pos3 -> start+3 but special for last group; color 4 pos0 checks next group's color for +3 vs +1); original 8-range is min-max columns with 8 in rows 6-24; max_prop_i is highest has_prop row index; rightmost upper pair determines if +1 offset for right_fill_start; lower left_fill_start from first pair or original min.
 * Easy to miss: First group handles color 1 specially for lower; lower prop num=2 but clipped to 19; pairs only placed if activated and color !=3; output copies input rows 6-24 then modifies; invalid input returns empty list.
 * Across attempts: No full successes; common issues include over-placing 8's in non-prop areas, missing full range fills (e.g., not expanding to connect 8's properly), incorrect pair positions based on clue logic, and failing to handle block transitions (upper to lower) or special fills (right/left).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = Counter()
    for row in grid[6:]:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in [0, 5, 8]:
                count[cell] += 1
    return max(count, key=count.get) if count else 3
```
(This correctly identifies bkg by frequency, excluding specials; useful for all cases.)

```python
def get_clue_color(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> int:
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val
    return 0
```
(Extracts key color per group; helpful for pair logic, especially cross-group checks like color 4 pos0.)

```python
def get_original_eight_range(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_col = 24
    max_col = -1
    for i in range(6, 25):
        row = grid[i]
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 8:
                min_col = min(min_col, j)
                max_col = max(max_col, j)
    return min_col, max_col if max_col >= 0 else (0, -1)
```
(Finds global min-max 8 columns for lower pairs/propagations; essential for cases with pre-existing 8's.)

```python
def find_has_prop_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    has_prop = []
    for i in range(19):
        row = grid[6 + i]
        if any(cell == 8 for cell in row):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Identifies rows needing has-prop fill; useful but needs integration with max_prop_i for block split.)

```python
def propagate_has_prop(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    eight_cols = [j for j, cell in enumerate(new_row) if cell == 8]
    if not eight_cols:
        return new_row
    min_j = min(eight_cols)
    max_j = max(eight_cols)
    for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
        if new_row[j] == bkg:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```
(Fills gaps between min-max 8's in a row; core for has-prop, but unhelpful if applied too broadly without 8's present.)

```python
def is_all_bkg_row(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> bool:
    return all(cell == bkg for cell in row)
```
(Detects pure bkg rows for upper block end; helpful for limiting initial placements.)

The `compute_seed_pairs` and `get_first_group_info` functions are partially helpful for pair extraction but buggy (e.g., incomplete activation logic, special cases like gi=3 for color 2 mishandled); `place_seeds` is straightforward but overused without checks. Overall program structure (copy output, replace 5's, place then propagate) is a good skeleton but fails on block transitions and specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, bkg detection, and pair placement but fails all training examples due to incorrect propagations and pair positions.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8's in rows 7-8 (full middle fill too early) and row 9 (8's at 4-5 instead of connecting properly); missed full connection in row 7-8 (expected 0-3 as 1's unchanged, but placed 8's wrongly); lower rows 14-16 overfilled with 8's instead of partial; rows 16-18 correct for 2's but upper mismatches blob shapes (unknown why, possibly wrong upper_pairs or prop range).
 * Train 2: Generated wrong 8-range in row 2 (8's at 14-17 instead of 14-23 full); missed full 8-propagation in rows 2-3 (expected 8's to 23); row 5 has extra 8's at 16-17 where expected 1's; row 14 has 8's at 8-15 instead of none; row 15 partial 8's missing; lower rows 16-18 correct but upper prop fails to connect properly (e.g., row 8-9 should connect more).
 * Train 3: Generated wrong initial 8's in row 0-2 (3's at 8-17 instead of 8's? Wait, expected has 8's at 18-19 but generated 3's there initially?); rows 4-6 have 8's at 8-17 but expected full 0-4 8's in row 4; row 12 has 8's at 5-13 but expected none/more specific; row 13 overfills 8's at 5-13; row 14 partial but misses full 14-23 8's; lower row 16-18 has 7's at 3-4 instead of none, and 4's start too early without full prop.
 * Common misses: Over-placement of 8's in non-activated areas; incorrect block split (max_prop_i too low/high, leading to wrong upper/lower pairs); right-fill applied wrongly (e.g., starts too early or not at all); lower prop start/num hardcoded poorly (14 for 1/4 but affects fills); original 8-range not always used for lower pairs; has_prop applied universally instead of selectively.
 * Function `propagate_lower_prop_right_fill` is helpful for right-fills but unhelpful when misapplied (e.g., fills from wrong start, overfills empty rows).
 * Function `get_first_group_info` is broken for some colors (e.g., doesn't handle pos0 color=4/6 fully, leading to wrong lower pairs in Train 1/2).
 * Overall, attempt shows core structure but lacks precise clue-to-pair mapping and prop conditions; unhelpful to reuse raw `program` without fixes to activation and block logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an ERROR (invalid grid format: returned <class 'list'> instead of proper 19x24 List[List[int]]), indicating a crash likely from unhandled input dimensions, empty pairs, or index errors in propagation (e.g., pair_end >23 or max_prop_i invalid).
 * No generated grid to evaluate, but based on training failures, it would likely mismatch by over/under-placing 8's, wrong bkg replacement, or failed propagations (e.g., missing connections in has-prop rows or incorrect lower fills); does not look correct as it didn't produce output at all—must fix input validation and edge cases like no 8's or unusual clue colors to handle test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a 25-row by 24-column grid where rows 6-24 represent a drawable area with a background color, existing "8" elements (likely props or paint to propagate), and clues in upper rows (e.g., row 1) that dictate pair placements and fills of "8"s in upper (top ~half) and lower (bottom ~half) sections. The goal is to propagate and fill "8"s based on clue-derived rules for pairs, gaps, special connections, and background replacement, while preserving non-background elements like colored blocks (1-7,9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection: Scan rows 6-24, count non-0/5/8 cells, pick most common as background (default 3); replace all 5's with it. Subtle: Ignores 0/5/8 to avoid miscounting empties/props/specials, but may fail if background is rare or tied to clues.
 * Clue row parsing: Clues in row 1, divided into 4 groups of 4 cells (starts at indices 1,7,13,19). Each group has a "color" (non-0/5 value) and "position" (0-3 offset where color appears). Color=0 or 3 skips group; others trigger pair starts based on color/pos combos (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may depend on next group's color). Subtle: Last group (start 19) has edge case for pos=3/color=2 shifting to 18; pairs are always 2-wide (start to start+1), but computation varies (e.g., color 6 at pos 0 -> start+1; color 4 at pos 3 -> start+2).
 * Upper vs. lower sections: Upper is rows 0 to max_prop_i (index of last row with original 8's); lower is after. Place pairs as 8's only if the slot is all-background. Subtle: Upper uses multiple pairs from all groups; lower uses single pair from first group (with extra color=1 case at pos=0 -> start+3) or original 8-range if no special lower condition.
 * Original 8's range: Find min/max col with 8's in rows 6-24; used for lower fills if not special. Subtle: If no 8's, defaults to (24,-1) which skips.
 * Has_prop rows: Rows (0-18 relative) with any original 8; after placing pairs/seeds, fill gaps between min/max 8 in that row with 8's (connect blobs horizontally).
 * Special lower fills: For rows 14-15 (absolute 20-21?) if first group color in {1,2,4}, connect existing 8's to a target range (e.g., color=1 -> to col 23; color=2 -> from min_col to 23; color=4 -> from leftmost 8 to min_col). Subtle: Only if min_col <24 and 8's exist; applied after seeds but before/in gap fill? Order matters for connections.
 * Right fill upper: If upper pairs exist, find rightmost pair start; if it matches a computed group position and is at group_start+1, fill from that col to 24 with 8's—but only in the FIRST all-background row up to max_prop_i. Subtle: Only activates for specific cases (e.g., gi !=-1 and exact pos); seems to target a "spillover" but only once, which may miss multi-row propagation.
 * Propagation order: Replace 5's first -> compute pairs/ranges -> place seeds in upper/lower -> gap fill in has_prop rows -> special lower fills. Subtle: Gap fill only in has_prop (not all rows), and special lower overrides/reconnects based on color; no vertical propagation, only horizontal connects/fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty pairs/ranges skip; indices 0-23 cols; output is rows 6-24 modified. Subtle: Lower special skips if color not in [1,2,4]; background may be non-3 (e.g., 1 or 7 in examples); clues may have 0/5 as fillers.
 * General: Preserve non-bkg/non-8 (e.g., 1-4,6,7,9 blocks); no overwriting existing 8's; fills only on bkg slots.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = Counter()
    for row in grid[6:25]:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in [0, 5, 8]:
                count[cell] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 3
```
(Helpful: Correctly detects dominant non-empty/prop color as bkg; used in all placements.)

```python
def get_group_info(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val, p
    return 0, -1
```
(Helpful: Extracts color/pos from 4-cell group; core for pair computation; handles fillers.)

```python
def get_original_eight_range(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_col = 24
    max_col = -1
    for row in grid[6:25]:
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 8:
                min_col = min(min_col, j)
                max_col = max(max_col, j)
    return min_col, max_col if max_col >= 0 else (24, -1)

def get_has_prop_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    has_prop = []
    for i in range(19):
        if any(cell == 8 for cell in grid[6 + i]):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Helpful: Finds global 8-range for lower seeds; identifies rows needing gap fills. Essential for sectioning upper/lower and connecting.)

```python
def get_first_color(clue_row: List[int]) -> int:
    return get_group_info(clue_row, 1)[0]
```
(Helpful: Quick first-group color for special lower trigger.)

The pair computation functions (compute_upper_pairs, compute_lower_pair) are partially helpful for deriving 2-wide starts from clues but buggy (see below; overcomplicated logic misses cases). apply_right_fill_upper is unhelpful/broken (only fills one row, specific pos, doesn't propagate). Gap fill logic in main loop is helpful but limited to has_prop rows only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/only attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, background, and horizontal fills but fails all trainings due to incomplete propagation.
 * Train 1: Generated correctly places some upper pairs (e.g., 8,8 at cols 8-9 and 16-17 in early rows) and lower 2's/4's, detects bkg=3, but misses full connections in has_prop rows (e.g., row 7: generated has 8's only at 4-5? Wait, actually generated row7 [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,3,3] but expected starts 8's at col0; diff: generated delays left-fill until row8, and row11 has extra 3's vs expected 8's? Unknown why partial gap fill). Also, row12 generated has 8's at 0-1 but expected none there; special lower not triggering full right-fill in rows 14-16. Right fill didn't activate.
 * Train 2: Generated places upper pairs correctly in some rows (e.g., 8,8 at 4-5,8-9), bkg=1, but misses extending 8's in lower non-special rows (e.g., row3: generated 8's only partial vs expected full 13-23; row14: generated no 8's vs expected full connect). Lower pair computation wrong (places at wrong pos for color=6?). Special lower (rows16-18 with 4's) correct but upstream misses prevent full blobs. Gap fill skips non-has_prop or doesn't connect to min_col properly.
 * Train 3: Generated bkg=7 correctly, places some 8's (e.g., 3-4,18-19 pairs), but misses vertical consistency and full upper connects (e.g., row4: generated 8's at 8-9 but expected full 0-23 except edges; row5-6 similar partial). Has_prop gap fill incomplete (e.g., row11: generated connects some but leaves gaps at 8-17 vs expected full). Lower special not handled (rows16-18: generated 4's start at col8 but expected from col3; unknown pos miscalc). Right fill absent. Edge: row14 generated partial 8's vs expected more connects.
 * Overall: Pair logic over-relies on pos/color combos, missing spillover (e.g., color4 depending on next group often wrong). Gap fill only horizontal/per-row, no multi-row or full-section flood. Special lower misfires (wrong leftmost/to_col for colors). apply_right_fill_upper unhelpful (too narrow, only one row, didn't trigger in any train). No vertical propagation, leading to fragmented 8's. compute_lower_pair adds color=1 case but buggy (pos=0/1 overlap?). Program preserves colors well but under-fills 8's systematically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it seems to mishandle background (fills early rows 0-2 with 2's, but if bkg=3 at end, why 2's? Possible clue color leak or wrong bkg detect—clues may have 2's dominating count). Upper pairs/seeds partial (e.g., row7 has 8's at 8-10 but fragmented with 9's; expected smoother connects based on trains). Has_prop gap fill inconsistent (e.g., row13: 8's scattered with 9's gaps vs expected solid blobs). Lower special likely wrong (rows17-18: 4's at 7-15 but 8's/9's around; if first_color=4, should connect to min_col=3? but mixes with 9's). Ends with 9's, suggesting bkg=9 or un-replaced, but trains show preservation—output has too many isolated 8's and no full right-fills. Doesn't match train patterns (e.g., no solid lower 8-range); likely misses clue-dependent pairs and over-relies on original 8's which may be sparse. Unknown test clues/grid, but fragmented 8's/9's suggest broken pair computation or gap fill not extending to edges.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if len(g) != 25 or len(g[0]) != 24:
        return []
    output = [row[:] for row in g[6:25]]
    bkg = find_background(g)

Test input result: ERROR - Program returned invalid grid format: <class 'list'>
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 21:58:32] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to generate a 19x24 output grid (rows 6-24 of the input) representing a support structure filled with 8s (beams or props) on a background color, based on clues in row 1 that dictate group-based pair placements, anchors from original 8s, propagation of fills, and special conditional rules for upper/lower sections, while replacing temporary 5s with background and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid is 25 rows by 24 columns; output must be exactly rows 6-24 (19 rows x 24 cols), with all non-8 cells set to the detected background color (most common non-0/5/8 value in output rows, defaulting to 3 if none).
 * Clue row (g[1]) is divided into 4 groups starting at columns 1,7,13,19 (each 4 cols wide); each group has a "color" (1-7, non-0/5) and "pos" (0-3 offset where color appears), which triggers specific pair placements (cols for 8-pairs) in upper (top half) or lower (bottom half) sections, with activations only for certain color-pos combos (e.g., color 1 pos 0 triggers lower pairs and left support at col 4-5; color 2/4/6 at pos 0 or 3 trigger upper pairs with offsets like +1, +3).
 * Anchor range is the min-max columns of original 8s in input rows 6-24; these must be filled with 8s across all output rows if background, but only in "has_prop" rows (those originally containing any 8).
 * Upper pairs apply to rows <= max_has_prop (upper block), lower pairs to rows > max_has_prop (lower block); special left support pairs (col 4-5) apply only to upper has_prop rows if color 1 pos 0.
 * Propagation: In has_prop rows, fill all background cells between min and max 8 positions with 8s (gap filling).
 * Special fills: If color 1 pos 0, fill cols 4+ to end with 8s in specific lower rows (14-15, 0-indexed in output); for upper right fill, if rightmost upper pair starts at group_start+1, fill cols from that start to end in the first 2 all-background upper rows.
 * Subtleties: Pairs only place if both cells are background (no overwrite); color 4 at pos 0 may skip next group if followed by color 2; background detection ignores 0/5/8; 5s are placeholders to replace with background before placing; has_prop rows are only those with original 8s, and max_prop_i is their max index (splits upper/lower); for last group (start 19), pos 3 color 2 adjusts pair_start to 18; empty groups (all 0/5) or color 3 skip pairs; propagation is per-row and only in has_prop rows; upper right fill requires detecting "plus1" starts and finding initial all-background block (may be 0-2 rows).
 * Edge cases: No original 8s means no anchors/propagation/max_prop_i=-1 (all upper pairs, no lower/left support); test input may have different dimensions or empty clues, causing format errors; overwrites must be avoided, but fills can expand existing 8s; lower right fill is narrow (only rows 14-15, cols 4+); upper block for right fill is prefix of all-background rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Detects most common non-0/5/8 color in rows 6-24; useful for background replacement and checks.
    count = Counter()
    for row in grid[6:25]:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in [0, 5, 8]:
                count[cell] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 3
```

```python
def get_group_info(clue_row: List[int], start: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Extracts color (non-0/5) and pos (offset 0-3) for a 4-col group; essential for pair triggers.
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val, p
    return 0, -1
```

```python
def compute_upper_pairs(clue_row: List[int], group_starts: List[int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Computes column pairs (start, start+1) for upper activations based on color-pos rules; handles skips for color 4 + next 2.
    # (Full implementation as in attempt; core for upper structure.)
    pairs = []
    for gi in range(4):
        # ... (as provided)
    return pairs
```

```python
def get_original_eight_range(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Finds min-max col of original 8s in rows 6-24; defines anchor fill range.
    min_col = 24
    max_col = -1
    for row in grid[6:25]:
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 8:
                min_col = min(min_col, j)
                max_col = max(max_col, j)
    return (min_col, max_col) if max_col >= 0 else (24, -1)
```

```python
def find_has_prop_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    # Returns 0-indexed list of output rows (0-18 for rows 6-24) that originally have any 8; used for propagation and split.
    return [i for i, row in enumerate(grid[6:25]) if any(c == 8 for c in row)]
```

```python
def propagate_gaps(grid: List[List[int]], has_prop: List[int], bkg: int):
    # Fills background gaps between min-max 8s in each has_prop row; key for connecting structures.
    for i in has_prop:
        row = grid[6 + i]  # Adjust for output indexing
        eight_cols = [j for j in range(24) if row[j] == 8]
        if eight_cols:
            min_j = min(eight_cols)
            max_j = max(eight_cols)
            for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
                if row[j] == bkg:
                    row[j] = 8
```

**Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `compute_lower_pairs`: Too simplistic; only handles color 1 pos 0 with fixed pair at 1+3=4, but misses broader lower rules (e.g., no pairs for other colors, and doesn't integrate with has_prop split properly; generated outputs show missing lower 8s in Train 2 rows 2-4, where expected has 8s at 13-23).
- `apply_lower_right_fill`: Hardcoded to rows 14-15 (output indices 8-9?) and cols 4+, but only if color 1 pos 0; broken for general cases, as Train 1 generated no such fill but expected subtle right 3s (not 8s); causes overfill or miss.
- `apply_upper_right_fill`: Complex but buggy; detects "plus1" but fills only first 2 all-bkg upper rows from rightmost pair start; in Train 1, it overfills right cols 22-23 with 8s in early rows (generated has 8,8 vs expected 3,3), and in Train 3, it doesn't trigger correctly, missing full right expansions.
- `place_seeds`: Attempts conditional placement but ignores full grid state; places anchors everywhere (even non-has_prop), causing overfill in lower blocks (e.g., Train 1 rows 16-18 have extra 8s in cols 4-15 where expected 2s/3s); also places pairs without checking has_prop boundaries properly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of clue parsing (groups, colors, pos) and background/anchor basics, but fails on conditional placements, propagation limits, and special fills, leading to all trainings incorrect.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8-pairs at cols 22-23 in rows 0-2,6-12 (vs expected 3,3 there, indicating overactive upper right fill or anchor expansion); rows 4-6 have 8,8 at 22-23 vs expected 3,3 or 4,4/3,3; rows 9-10 have 3,3 at 22-23 vs expected 3,3 (match) but earlier mismatches like row 8 has 4,4/3,3 vs 4,4/3,3 (partial match); row 12 has 3,3 at end vs 3,3 (match); lower rows 14-15 overfill cols 4-23 with 8s vs expected 8s only in anchor range; rows 16-18 have 2s starting at col 4 but expected same (match, but propagation missed gaps). Propagation works partially but applies anchors too broadly.
 * Train 2: Generated missing wide 8-fill in rows 2-4 cols 13-23 (has 1,1/1,1/1,1 vs expected 8s across, indicating failed lower pair or right fill trigger for color 6); row 14 has 8s cols 8-15 vs expected 8s cols 8-23 (underfill right); row 15 overfills cols 0-7 with 1s? Wait, generated 1s but expected 8s cols 0-23 partial; lower rows 16-18 match 4s but no 8-propagation into them. Upper pairs placed correctly for cols 4-5/8-9 but missed color 6 specifics (pair at 13?).
 * Train 3: Generated partial anchor fills but missed full expansions, e.g., rows 4-6 have 8s at 8-9/18-19 but expected wider 8s cols 0-7/16-19 in some; rows 11-12 have 8s cols 3-23 but expected 8s cols 3-19/6+; row 13 has 7s cols 0-2/20-23 vs expected 8s expansions; row 14 underfills cols 0-2/20-23; lower rows 16-18 have 4s cols 8-21 but expected 4s cols 8-21 with 7s edges (match but no prop). Color 2/6 triggers partial pairs but propagation doesn't connect to anchors fully; left groups (cols 0-3) have mismatched 7/2 vs expected 8 expansions.
 * Common issues: Over-placement of anchors/pairs outside has_prop (e.g., full grid anchors in Train 1 lower); incorrect upper/lower split (max_prop_i not limiting lower pairs properly, causing Train 2 underfill); special fills trigger wrongly (extra right 8s in Train 1, missing in Train 3); replace_fives works (no 5s remain) but background=3 assumed correctly; compute_upper_pairs misses skips (e.g., Train 1 color 4 pos? followed by 2?); no handling for empty has_prop (max_prop_i=-1 leads to all-upper, but Train 2 expects lower 8s).
 * get_group_info and find_background are solid (clues parsed right, bkg=3/1/7 matches inputs); place_pair is helpful but too permissive (no full conflict check beyond bkg).

**Test output:**
 * No valid generated output (ERROR: returned <class 'list'> instead of List[List[int]]); likely a bug in program() return (e.g., slicing g[6:25] fails if input !=25 rows, or empty output [] if dimensions wrong); this suggests the program assumes fixed 25x24 but test input may vary (e.g., smaller grid or non-list), causing crash—does not make sense as output, as it can't be verified; expected output unknown without rules run, but mentally: if test has unique clues (e.g., color 3 skips, or no 8s), output should be mostly bkg with minimal pairs/anchors; to fix, add dimension checks and return empty/fixed grid on error, but current crash indicates poor robustness for test case.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 21:58:51] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties Across All Train Examples

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements observed in **every** train input/output pair. These are limited to properties or components that reliably interact or affect each other (e.g., one element's position/color/holes influencing another's transformation, preservation, or expansion) in identical ways across all three examples. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., the exact positions of top-row small blocks varying without clear output effect, or background holes count changing unpredictably) are excluded. Unknown mechanisms (e.g., how top-row small blocks precisely alter top output blocks) are noted as such without speculation. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is implied or provided.

1. **Input Top Orange Bar (with Holes) ↔ Placement of Small Colored Blocks**  
   - Component: Horizontal Orange block (always holes=4, bbox=[0,0,23,5], pixels=80) in all inputs.  
   - Interaction: Serves as a consistent "container" where 4 small rectangular blocks (each holes=0, pixels=4, vertical orientation, bbox width=1, height=3) of varying colors (e.g., Blue/Pink/Yellow/Red) are positioned inside its bounding box (y=1-4 subset of 0-5), aligned horizontally at distinct x-positions.  
   - Effect: The orange bar's holes enable spatial containment; the small blocks' colors and x-positions within it consistently influence output top-region creation (see connection #5), but exact transformation unknown. No preservation of orange in outputs.

2. **Input Small Maroon Block → Output Large Maroon Structure (Expansion)**  
   - Component: Small Maroon block in all inputs (holes=0, pixels=4, compact bbox ~1x1 or 1x2, positioned mid-height y=13-18, central x=8-13).  
   - Interaction: Acts as a "seed" that consistently expands in outputs into a large horizontal-spanning Maroon structure (bbox x~0-23 or 0-19, y=0 to ~15, pixels=116-138, holes=0-2).  
   - Effect: Expansion encloses or borders other output elements (e.g., repositioned blocks and primary-colored fills); interacts with spatial arrangements by creating a consistent upper-frame boundary, integrating asymmetric placements from input.

3. **Input Large Background Block (Color) → Output Primary Color Fills**  
   - Component: Large bottom block in all inputs (holes=1-2, bbox=[0,6,23,24], pixels=290-366, color varies but consistent per example: Green/Blue/Dark Red).  
   - Interaction: Its color property directly determines the dominant color for multiple output blocks forming expansive fields (e.g., horizontal bars and vertical strips in top/middle y=0-18).  
   - Effect: Creates interconnected background fields that fill non-Maroon/output-block spaces; interacts with position by extending into top regions (e.g., new blocks at y=0-6), affecting overall spatial transformation. Pixel totals increase but color consistency preserved. No direct bbox or holes preservation.

4. **Input Secondary Colored Blocks (Lower Non-Top/Non-Background) ↔ Output Repositioned Blocks (Preservation with Movement)**  
   - Component: 3-4 rectangular blocks in all inputs below top row (y=6+, not background; holes=0, pixels=24-44 each, colors vary e.g., Blue/Yellow/Red/Pink/Green; shapes: tall verticals width~3 height~8-12, or horizontals width~8-10 height~1-2).  
   - Interaction: Each block's color, pixel count, and approximate shape (bbox dimensions, e.g., width/height ratios) are exactly preserved in outputs, but consistently repositioned upward (input y~6-24 → output y~0-18, often shifted left/right slightly).  
   - Effect: Interacts with output Maroon frame (#2) and primary fills (#3) by being integrated into upper structures (e.g., placed within or adjacent to them); enables consistent "movement" transformation affecting spatial arrangements without altering intrinsic properties (e.g., Train1 Blue pixels=36 preserved at new bbox [0,3,3,11]).

5. **Input Top-Row Small Blocks (Colors/Positions) → Output Top Small Primary-Colored Blocks (Influence, Mechanism Unknown)**  
   - Component: The 4 small blocks inside input orange bar (#1; each pixels=4, varying colors).  
   - Interaction: Their colors and relative x-positions consistently influence the creation of 2-4 new small blocks in output top rows (y=0-6, pixels~10-42 each, using input background's primary color from #3).  
   - Effect: These new blocks form horizontal alignments or enclosures at top, interacting with the expanding Maroon (#2) by bordering it; positions loosely correspond to input small blocks' x-locations (e.g., left/center/right clusters). Exact pixel combination or transformation rule unknown (e.g., 4x4=16 input pixels → 40/42 output, no direct match).

[2025-10-02 22:01:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties Across All Train Examples

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements observed in **every** train input/output pair. These are limited to properties or components that reliably interact or affect each other (e.g., one element's position/color/holes influencing another's transformation, preservation, or expansion) in identical ways across all three examples. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., the exact positions of top-row small blocks varying without clear output effect, or background holes count changing unpredictably) are excluded. Unknown mechanisms (e.g., how top-row small blocks precisely alter top output blocks) are noted as such without speculation. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is implied or provided.

1. **Input Top Orange Bar (with Holes) ↔ Placement of Small Colored Blocks**  
   - Component: Horizontal Orange block (always holes=4, bbox=[0,0,23,5], pixels=80) in all inputs.  
   - Interaction: Serves as a consistent "container" where 4 small rectangular blocks (each holes=0, pixels=4, vertical orientation, bbox width=1, height=3) of varying colors (e.g., Blue/Pink/Yellow/Red) are positioned inside its bounding box (y=1-4 subset of 0-5), aligned horizontally at distinct x-positions.  
   - Effect: The orange bar's holes enable spatial containment; the small blocks' colors and x-positions within it consistently influence output top-region creation (see connection #5), but exact transformation unknown. No preservation of orange in outputs.

2. **Input Small Maroon Block → Output Large Maroon Structure (Expansion)**  
   - Component: Small Maroon block in all inputs (holes=0, pixels=4, compact bbox ~1x1 or 1x2, positioned mid-height y=13-18, central x=8-13).  
   - Interaction: Acts as a "seed" that consistently expands in outputs into a large horizontal-spanning Maroon structure (bbox x~0-23 or 0-19, y=0 to ~15, pixels=116-138, holes=0-2).  
   - Effect: Expansion encloses or borders other output elements (e.g., repositioned blocks and primary-colored fills); interacts with spatial arrangements by creating a consistent upper-frame boundary, integrating asymmetric placements from input.

3. **Input Large Background Block (Color) → Output Primary Color Fills**  
   - Component: Large bottom block in all inputs (holes=1-2, bbox=[0,6,23,24], pixels=290-366, color varies but consistent per example: Green/Blue/Dark Red).  
   - Interaction: Its color property directly determines the dominant color for multiple output blocks forming expansive fields (e.g., horizontal bars and vertical strips in top/middle y=0-18).  
   - Effect: Creates interconnected background fields that fill non-Maroon/output-block spaces; interacts with position by extending into top regions (e.g., new blocks at y=0-6), affecting overall spatial transformation. Pixel totals increase but color consistency preserved. No direct bbox or holes preservation.

4. **Input Secondary Colored Blocks (Lower Non-Top/Non-Background) ↔ Output Repositioned Blocks (Preservation with Movement)**  
   - Component: 3-4 rectangular blocks in all inputs below top row (y=6+, not background; holes=0, pixels=24-44 each, colors vary e.g., Blue/Yellow/Red/Pink/Green; shapes: tall verticals width~3 height~8-12, or horizontals width~8-10 height~1-2).  
   - Interaction: Each block's color, pixel count, and approximate shape (bbox dimensions, e.g., width/height ratios) are exactly preserved in outputs, but consistently repositioned upward (input y~6-24 → output y~0-18, often shifted left/right slightly).  
   - Effect: Interacts with output Maroon frame (#2) and primary fills (#3) by being integrated into upper structures (e.g., placed within or adjacent to them); enables consistent "movement" transformation affecting spatial arrangements without altering intrinsic properties (e.g., Train1 Blue pixels=36 preserved at new bbox [0,3,3,11]).

5. **Input Top-Row Small Blocks (Colors/Positions) → Output Top Small Primary-Colored Blocks (Influence, Mechanism Unknown)**  
   - Component: The 4 small blocks inside input orange bar (#1; each pixels=4, varying colors).  
   - Interaction: Their colors and relative x-positions consistently influence the creation of 2-4 new small blocks in output top rows (y=0-6, pixels~10-42 each, using input background's primary color from #3).  
   - Effect: These new blocks form horizontal alignments or enclosures at top, interacting with the expanding Maroon (#2) by bordering it; positions loosely correspond to input small blocks' x-locations (e.g., left/center/right clusters). Exact pixel combination or transformation rule unknown (e.g., 4x4=16 input pixels → 40/42 output, no direct match).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 22:17:51] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[6][0]

def shift_and_fill(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    out = [[background for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
    for i in range(18):
        for j in range(w):
            val = g[i + 6][j]
            if val != 5:
                out[i][j] = val
    return out

def find_seed_columns_and_max_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    seed_cols = set()
    max_row = -1
    for i in range(6, h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] == 8:
                seed_cols.add(j)
                if i > max_row:
                    max_row = i
    return list(seed_cols), max_row - 6 if max_row >= 6 else -1

            if out[i][j] == background:
                out[i][j] = 8

def expand_sideways(out: List[List[int]], seed_cols: list, background: int, lower_row: int):
    if lower_row < 0 or not seed_cols:

    j = right + 1
    while j < w and out[lower_row][j] == background:
        out[lower_row][j] = 8
        j += 1

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    background = get_background(g)
    out = shift_and_fill(g, background)
    seed_cols, lower_row = find_seed_columns_and_max_row(g)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 22:19:40] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top rows (likely 0-5) represent an "above-ground" or sky area filled with background, and the content from lower rows (6+) is shifted up into a new grid. The number 8 represents a filling substance (e.g., "sand" or "growth") that originates from seed positions in the shifted content and expands vertically upward and horizontally sideways into background areas, but only in connected regions without crossing barriers (possibly number 5 acts as a barrier since it's skipped in copying). The goal is to produce a filled grid matching the expected patterns, where 8's propagate in a way that forms connected blobs, often widening horizontally at certain levels and filling "pockets" above the seeds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a fixed structure: 25 rows x 24 columns (based on output lengths), with background determined from g[6][0], suggesting row 6 is a reference for ground level or initial background.
 * Shifting: Content from rows 6+ of input g is copied to rows 0+ of output, but only non-5 values are preserved; 5's are treated as erasable or barriers (replaced with background), and top 6 rows of output are pure background— this works partially but leads to incomplete fills if expansion doesn't account for post-shift connections.
 * Seeds for 8's: Identified as positions with 8 in rows 6+ of input (shifted to 0+), collecting unique columns and the lowest (max row index) seed row; this identifies starting points but misses that expansion should connect across multiple seeds horizontally if they are at similar levels or via background.
 * Vertical expansion: Fills upward (from max_row +1 to top) only in exact seed columns if background—this is too narrow; expected outputs show 8's filling entire connected horizontal spans (e.g., widening to multiple columns) and propagating up through adjacent background cells, not just vertically in seeds.
 * Sideways expansion: Only at the specific lower_row (max seed row shifted), expanding left/right from min/max seed columns until non-background—this is limited to one row and doesn't propagate upward or connect blobs; expected shows horizontal fills at multiple rows (e.g., full-width 8's in some levels) and diagonal-ish connections.
 * Barriers and non-fills: 8's do not overwrite existing non-background numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 stay intact); only background is filled. Number 5 is skipped in initial copy, acting like a temporary barrier or void. Expansions stop at edges or other numbers. Subtle: Fills can "bridge" across background at various heights if connected to seeds via paths (e.g., in training 1, 8's extend right to col 16-17 in top rows, suggesting horizontal connectivity above seeds).
 * Connectivity: Likely requires flood-fill-like behavior (BFS/DFS from seeds upward and sideways through background only), not just linear expands— this is a key miss, as current code treats seeds independently without merging blobs. Also, fills may not go infinitely up (stops at top or barriers), and some expected patterns show 8's "hanging" or widening mid-grid.
 * Other elements: Existing shapes (e.g., 1's, 2's, 4's) remain but may get 8's filled around/above them; bottom rows in some examples have unchanged patterns (e.g., 2's in training 1). Grids may have multiple disconnected 8 blobs that need independent expansion. Easy to miss: Expansions can happen in "pockets" above barriers, and seeds might not be in every column, requiring horizontal spread before vertical.
 * All training examples failed due to under-filling: 8's didn't spread wide enough horizontally or connect across rows/columns as in expected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current functions provide a basic framework for shifting and seed detection but need enhancement for proper expansion (e.g., integrate flood fill).

```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[6][0]  # Helpful: Correctly identifies background from a fixed reference point.
```

```python
def shift_and_fill(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    out = [[background for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
    for i in range(18):  # Assumes h=24, shifts 18 rows (6+ to 24)
        for j in range(w):
            val = g[i + 6][j]
            if val != 5:
                out[i][j] = val
    return out  # Helpful: Basic shifting and 5-skipping works (preserves shapes), but top 6 rows are correctly background-filled; issue is post-shift expansion.
```

```python
def find_seed_columns_and_max_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    seed_cols = set()
    max_row = -1
    for i in range(6, h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] == 8:
                seed_cols.add(j)
                if i > max_row:
                    max_row = i
    return list(seed_cols), max_row - 6 if max_row >= 6 else -1  # Helpful: Accurately finds 8 seeds in lower input rows and computes shifted max row; useful for starting flood fill from these points.
```

The expansion functions (expand_vertical, expand_sideways) are broken/not helpful: They perform linear fills only in seed columns or at one row, missing connected region filling—do not reuse without major changes (e.g., replace with flood fill from all seeds).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single summarized attempt (the provided program); it partially understands shifting and seed detection but fails on expansion logic across all training examples.
 * Worked: Background detection is correct (matches all examples). Shifting copies non-5 content accurately (e.g., preserves 1's, 2's, 4's shapes in all trainings). Seed column collection identifies starting 8 positions correctly (e.g., cols 8-9 in training 1).
 * Didn't work: Vertical expansion too narrow (only seed cols, no horizontal connectivity upward), leading to thin 8 columns instead of wide blobs (e.g., training 1 generated 8's only in cols 8-9 top-to-mid, but expected has cols 4-5 + 8-9 + extensions to 16-17; training 2 misses cols 4-5 and wide row 2-3; training 3 misses left/right spreads from col 3-4 to wider 8's).
 * Sideways expansion limited to one row (lower_row), no propagation (e.g., training 1 generated no right extension to col 16-17 in top rows; expected connects horizontally at multiple levels. Training 2 generated no 8's in cols 4-5 or wide row 2; expected has them. Training 3 generated 8's only in cols 12-13 mid-grid, but expected has full rows 4-5 as 8's from col 0-11+).
 * Overall under-filling of 8's: Generated outputs have fewer/sparser 8's than expected (e.g., training 1: generated row 8 has 8's only cols 8-9 + some lower, expected has cols 4-17; row 12 generated no 8's in col 4-5, expected has them. Training 2: generated row 2 has 8's only cols 8-9, expected cols 4-5+8-9+14-21. Training 3: generated row 4 has 7's where expected has 8's in cols 0-3+12. Differences are consistent: lack of blob merging and upward horizontal spread).
 * No handling of multi-level connectivity or flood fill, causing isolated 8's (e.g., unknown why training 1 row 9-10 have 8's only in cols 4-5? Wait, generated has 3's there, expected 8's—likely missed vertical from adjacent seeds).
 * Function expand_vertical is unhelpful/broken: Linear per-column fill ignores horizontal neighbors (don't reuse).
 * Function expand_sideways is unhelpful/broken: Single-row expansion doesn't propagate (don't reuse).
 * find_seed_columns_and_max_row is essential/helpful: Reuse for seed detection, but expand from all seeds simultaneously via flood fill.
 * shift_and_fill is essential/helpful: Core shifting works, but ensure post-shift grid allows connected fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and shows misunderstanding of expansion rules. It has 8's only in cols 8-10 for top 3 rows (narrow, like failed vertical expand), then mostly 9's in mid-grid with isolated 8's in row 7 cols 8-10, and bottom rows with 2's and a partial 4's row (row 17 has 4's in cols 7-16, but shifted oddly). This mismatches likely expectations: Based on patterns, test input probably has seeds in lower parts (e.g., around cols 8+), requiring wide 8 fills upward into background pockets around 9's and 1's, connecting horizontally (e.g., full-width 8's mid-grid like training 3, or extensions around 9's blob). Instead, generated under-fills 8's (no wide spreads), leaves excessive 9's unfilled, and doesn't connect bottom 2's area—looks like incomplete shifting/expansion, similar to training failures (e.g., no bridging over 9's). Make sure to account for flood-filling connected background regions from all seeds upward/sideways to handle test case's probable large 9's structure and bottom 2's/4's.

[2025-10-02 22:20:02] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three training input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** training example (inputs 1-3 and their outputs) with identical behavioral patterns. No assumptions are made about semantic meaning, puzzle-solving logic, or high-level structure. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the orange top bar, which appears consistently in inputs but has no clear, consistent transformation or interaction in outputs) are excluded. Inconsistent interactions (e.g., varying hole counts without a clear trigger) are noted as unknown where applicable. Only direct, observable links (e.g., color preservation, position shifts, size changes) are included.

1. **Input content blocks (colored rectangles below top row, excluding background and small maroon) ↔ Output content blocks (preserved colored rectangles)**:
   - **Color**: Identical (e.g., input blue → output blue; input red → output red; applies to all such blocks like yellow, pink, green).
   - **Pixels**: Unchanged (exact match, e.g., 28 pixels in input → 28 in output).
   - **Holes**: Set to 0 in output (inputs already have 0 for these blocks; no change observed).
   - **Bounding box (bbox)**: X-coordinates unchanged; Y-coordinates uniformly translated upward by exactly 6 units (y_min and y_max both decreased by 6, preserving width and height; e.g., input [0,9,3,17] → output [0,3,3,11]).
   - **Consistency note**: Applies to all 3-4 such blocks per example (e.g., input 1 has blue/ yellow/ red; input 2 has pink/ green/ red/ yellow; input 3 has green/ pink/ red/ yellow). No other transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling) observed.

2. **Input large background field ↔ Output panel fields (multiple new rectangles)**:
   - **Color**: Input background color directly determines output panel color (e.g., input green → all output panels green; input blue → all blue; input dark red → all dark red). Panels are new elements not present in input.
   - **Holes**: Always 0 in output panels (regardless of input background holes, which are 1-2).
   - **Position and size**: Panels form layered/ overlapping enclosures around shifted content blocks (e.g., spanning left/ right/ bottom edges, with bboxes like [0,0,X,6] for top panels or [X,12,Y,18] for side/ bottom). Sizes vary (pixels 10-96) but consistently create bordered spaces; no fixed bbox pattern beyond enclosing role.
   - **Consistency note**: Exactly 4-6 panels per output, all sharing the input background color. No preservation of input background's bbox, pixels, or holes.

3. **Input small maroon block ↔ Output large maroon frame**:
   - **Color**: Identical (maroon in both).
   - **Size/ Pixels**: Input small (always ~4-9 pixels, 1-2 wide, vertical) expands to large in output (~116-138 pixels, wide horizontal/ rectangular frame spanning ~75-100% width).
   - **Position**: Input mid-lower (bbox y ~13-18, x ~8-13); output shifted to top-mid (bbox y 0-15 or 0-18, x 0-23 or 4-23), often overlapping or bordering output panels and shifted contents.
   - **Holes**: Changes in output (input always 0; output 0-2); unknown trigger (not linked to input holes, background holes, or content count).
   - **Consistency note**: Single small maroon in every input → single large maroon frame in every output. Acts as an enclosing/ bordering element relative to panels and contents.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., top small vertical blocks have no clear transformation or effect on outputs; orange bar isolated to inputs; no reliable links between hole counts and color/ position across all examples).

[2025-10-02 22:22:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three training input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** training example (inputs 1-3 and their outputs) with identical behavioral patterns. No assumptions are made about semantic meaning, puzzle-solving logic, or high-level structure. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the orange top bar, which appears consistently in inputs but has no clear, consistent transformation or interaction in outputs) are excluded. Inconsistent interactions (e.g., varying hole counts without a clear trigger) are noted as unknown where applicable. Only direct, observable links (e.g., color preservation, position shifts, size changes) are included.

1. **Input content blocks (colored rectangles below top row, excluding background and small maroon) ↔ Output content blocks (preserved colored rectangles)**:
   - **Color**: Identical (e.g., input blue → output blue; input red → output red; applies to all such blocks like yellow, pink, green).
   - **Pixels**: Unchanged (exact match, e.g., 28 pixels in input → 28 in output).
   - **Holes**: Set to 0 in output (inputs already have 0 for these blocks; no change observed).
   - **Bounding box (bbox)**: X-coordinates unchanged; Y-coordinates uniformly translated upward by exactly 6 units (y_min and y_max both decreased by 6, preserving width and height; e.g., input [0,9,3,17] → output [0,3,3,11]).
   - **Consistency note**: Applies to all 3-4 such blocks per example (e.g., input 1 has blue/ yellow/ red; input 2 has pink/ green/ red/ yellow; input 3 has green/ pink/ red/ yellow). No other transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling) observed.

2. **Input large background field ↔ Output panel fields (multiple new rectangles)**:
   - **Color**: Input background color directly determines output panel color (e.g., input green → all output panels green; input blue → all blue; input dark red → all dark red). Panels are new elements not present in input.
   - **Holes**: Always 0 in output panels (regardless of input background holes, which are 1-2).
   - **Position and size**: Panels form layered/ overlapping enclosures around shifted content blocks (e.g., spanning left/ right/ bottom edges, with bboxes like [0,0,X,6] for top panels or [X,12,Y,18] for side/ bottom). Sizes vary (pixels 10-96) but consistently create bordered spaces; no fixed bbox pattern beyond enclosing role.
   - **Consistency note**: Exactly 4-6 panels per output, all sharing the input background color. No preservation of input background's bbox, pixels, or holes.

3. **Input small maroon block ↔ Output large maroon frame**:
   - **Color**: Identical (maroon in both).
   - **Size/ Pixels**: Input small (always ~4-9 pixels, 1-2 wide, vertical) expands to large in output (~116-138 pixels, wide horizontal/ rectangular frame spanning ~75-100% width).
   - **Position**: Input mid-lower (bbox y ~13-18, x ~8-13); output shifted to top-mid (bbox y 0-15 or 0-18, x 0-23 or 4-23), often overlapping or bordering output panels and shifted contents.
   - **Holes**: Changes in output (input always 0; output 0-2); unknown trigger (not linked to input holes, background holes, or content count).
   - **Consistency note**: Single small maroon in every input → single large maroon frame in every output. Acts as an enclosing/ bordering element relative to panels and contents.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., top small vertical blocks have no clear transformation or effect on outputs; orange bar isolated to inputs; no reliable links between hole counts and color/ position across all examples).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar

[2025-10-02 22:47:28] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 representing colors) where the top 6 rows appear to be a header or metadata, and the task is to extract and shift down the content below it, identify rectangular "panels" or blocks of uniform color (excluding background, 0, 5, 8), detect a special "maroon" (8) connector block, and then augment the layout by filling gaps and extending 8-colored borders to connect panels horizontally and vertically in a structured way, likely simulating comic panel borders or a unified strip.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background color (bg) is determined by the most common non-0/5/8 color in rows below y=6; this works but can miss if ties or edge cases occur.
 * Content blocks are only rectangles of uniform color c (1-9, excluding bg/0/5/8) larger than 4 cells, starting from the topmost row with that color; non-rectangular or small blobs are ignored, which is key but fails if blocks aren't perfectly rectangular or if detection misses partial overlaps.
 * Maroon (8) block detection expands from the first found 8 cell to its full rectangle; it's treated specially as a connector, but the code assumes only one and starts search from y=6, potentially missing if multiple or positioned oddly.
 * Output grid is the input height minus 6 rows, initialized to bg, with content blocks placed shifted up by 6 rows; this cropping and shifting is core but can clip blocks if they extend into the top 6.
 * Connections with 8: Horizontal fills in "connection rows" (where maroon overlaps after shift) between content edges and maroon; full vertical middle bar through maroon x-range; conditional left lower bar extension if content below on left; right upper bar if content above on right; bottom horizontal fill near lowest blocks, with height based on gap size (1 or 2 rows) and x-range adjusted by reach; upper right gap fills between stacked right-side blocks, limited by their heights and connection row.
 * Subtleties: 5 might be a special non-content/non-bg color (ignored in counts/blocks); connections only fill bg cells (not overwriting content); horizontal fills in connection rows set uniform x-start/end but code computes per row, leading to inconsistencies; bottom fill x-start uses left_bar if extended, else maroon start, and x-end checks if lowest blocks reach right; upper right fills only for blocks entirely right of maroon and above connection, filling from right_bar to edge but only in gaps; no overwriting of existing non-bg; assumes w is constant; potential issues with y_min=6 exactly or maroon not overlapping content vertically after shift.
 * Edge cases: No maroon (returns empty, no connections); no blocks (empty output); maroon above y=6 (clips); overlapping blocks (detection takes first topmost); small gaps (h=1 vs 2 for bottom); right-side stacks with varying heights; left/right extensions only if content "touches" bar x-range; all fills are 8-only, no other colors.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Counts most common non-0/5/8 color below y=6; helpful for bg detection but assumes max wins ties.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of connection rules.
 * Train 1: Generated correctly shifted and placed blocks (1's left, 4's right, 2's bottom), detected bg=3 and maroon at x=8-9, but missed extending 8's rightward in upper connection rows (expected 8's at x=16-17 in rows 0-6); lower left 1's connected partially but no bottom horizontal 8's under gap; rows 9-11 have 8's only in maroon without left extension to x=4; rows 12-14 missing left 8's entirely; bottom 2's placed but no connection.
 * Train 2: Generated placed blocks (2's left, 3's right, 4's bottom, 6's mid-right) and maroon at x=8-9, bg=1, but missed left 8 extensions in rows 0-4 (expected at x=0-1); row 2 has extra 8's in right but overwrote or misfilled; connection rows (likely 5-9) have partial horizontals but no full upper right 8 bar in rows 14-15; bottom 4's isolated without connection.
 * Train 3: Generated bg=7, blocks (2's left, 3's top, 4's bottom, 6's right), maroon at x=12-13, but missed left 8 extensions in early rows (expected at x=0-1 in rows 0-3); row 4 has full 8's but overwrote 3's incorrectly; middle bar partial; lower extensions missing in rows 13-16 (expected more 8's under 7's); bottom 4's connected but x-range wrong (starts too left); upper fills incomplete.
 * Block detection generally works for rectangles but may miss if not starting exactly at topmost full row or if >4 size threshold excludes small panels.
 * Maroon detection finds block but expansion assumes horizontal then vertical, which fails if irregular shape.
 * Connection logic attempts horizontals per row but sets uniform h_start/h_end incorrectly (uses first row's, ignores variations); left/right bar conditions check overlap but use wrong y-ranges post-shift; bottom horizontal gap calc uses min_y but h=1/2 based on >4 arbitrary; upper right gap fill sorts blocks but fills only to w, may overfill or underfill heights.
 * place_content_blocks clips y but doesn't handle x clipping; create_output_grid initializes correctly.
 * Overall, core shifting and block placement works in parts, but connection fills are inconsistent (e.g., no rightward extensions in train 1/2, missing vertical bars in train 3); function find_maroon_block is helpful but returns empty on no 8, skipping connections; get_background_color ignores 8 correctly but may pick wrong if sparse.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on training patterns; it shifts content down by 6 (top 3 rows of 2's become rows 0-2, bottom 4's to rows 17-19, 9's and 1's placed), detects bg likely as 3 or 9? but fills much of the grid with 9's incorrectly (e.g., rows 3-6,9-16 mostly 9's where expected might be isolated blocks), maroon at x=8-9 extended vertically but horizontals overfill (e.g., row 7 full 8's from x=3-20, but training suggests only targeted fills); right side has 8's at x=19-20 in some rows but inconsistent with expected connections; bottom rows 17-19 have 4's but surrounded by 9's instead of connected 8's; upper right (rows 20-23) all 9's with 8's, likely misbg or overfill; lacks targeted gap fills (e.g., no bottom horizontal under 1's/9's to 4's); overall too much 9-overwrite and missing precise 8-bars, doesn't match structured connections from training expecteds.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 22:47:38] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Interactions

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of **only** the obvious, direct interactions or connections between components/properties that are **consistent across ALL examples**. These are limited to patterns that appear identically in every train pair (e.g., same transformation rule applied uniformly, same color mapping, same positional effect). I ignored any speculative or inconsistent patterns (e.g., varying hole counts in the large maroon output do not have a clear, consistent relation to input properties like background holes or small maroon position— this is marked as unknown). No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated top small verticals with no clear output effect, or the orange frame which consistently disappears without transforming into anything specific) are included. Only elements with demonstrated interaction/effect are listed.

#### 1. **Background Color → Output Top Fills Color**
   - **Description**: The color of the large background shape (high pixels ~290–366, holes=1 or 2, bbox starting at y=6 or 9 spanning to y=24 or 29, covering full x=0–23 width) directly determines the color of multiple new rectangular fill shapes in the output (medium pixels ~10–96, holes=0, positioned at top y=0–6 or y=0–13, various x-subranges covering most of width).
   - **Consistency**: In every pair:
     - Input bg Green → Output fills Green.
     - Input bg Blue → Output fills Blue.
     - Input bg Dark Red → Output fills Dark Red.
   - **Interaction Type**: Color propagation (input bg color overwrites/effects output fill colors directly; no change to input bg shape itself).
   - **Affected Properties**: Color only (output fills have new positions/sizes, but color match is exact and consistent).

#### 2. **Shape Position (min_y >=6) → Y-Position Shift**
   - **Description**: For any non-maroon shape with holes=0, pixels=24–63 (solid rectangles, various colors/sizes), and min_y >=6 (i.e., positioned at or below the background start), all y-coordinates in the bbox are shifted upward by exactly -6 units. The shape is preserved in the output at the new position.
   - **Consistency**: Applied identically in every pair to 3–4 such shapes per input (e.g., input1: Blue [0,9,3,17] → output [0,3,3,11]; input2: Red [0,11,3,17] → [0,5,3,11]; input3: Red [0,13,2,24] → [0,7,2,18]). Never applied to top shapes (min_y <6) or maroon shapes.
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional transformation (input position effects output position; shift is uniform and predictable).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Y-coordinates: Subtract 6 from y1 and y2 (e.g., [y1,y2] → [y1-6, y2-6]).
     - Preserved: Color, holes=0, bbox width (x unchanged), height (y2-y1 unchanged), pixels (exact match).
   - **Unaffected/Excluded**: Shapes with min_y <6 (e.g., top verticals), orange frame, or any maroon shapes.

#### 3. **Small Maroon Shape → Large Output Maroon Creation**
   - **Description**: The small maroon shape (color=Maroon, holes=0, pixels=4–9, bbox narrow width ~1–3 units at x=8–13, y=13–18) causes the creation of a new large maroon structure in the output (color=Maroon, high pixels ~116–138, bbox spanning y=0–15 and most x=0–23 width, holes=0–2).
   - **Consistency**: Present and interactive in every pair (e.g., input1: [8,13,9,14] pixels=4 → output [4,0,23,15] pixels=116; input2: [8,14,9,15] pixels=4 → [4,0,23,15] pixels=124; input3: [12,17,13,18] pixels=4 → [0,0,19,15] pixels=138). The small input maroon always disappears, and the large output one always appears in its place as the only large maroon.
   - **Interaction Type**: Component transformation (input small maroon effects creation of output large maroon; acts as a "seed" or trigger).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Color: Preserved as Maroon.
     - Size/Position: Transformed to large scale (new bbox covers top-to-mid canvas y=0–15, x mostly full; input x-center ~8–12 influences output x-start ~0–4, but exact mapping varies slightly—consistent presence/effect, not precise rule).
     - Pixels: Increases significantly (from ~4–9 to ~116–138).
     - Holes: Output has holes=0–2 (unknown consistent relation to input; input always holes=0, but output varies without clear tie to other inputs like bg holes=1–2).
   - **Unaffected/Excluded**: No preservation of input small maroon; no effect on non-maroon shapes.

#### Unknowns/Non-Consistent Interactions Noted
- **Hole Count Relations**: Input background holes (1–2) have no obvious consistent effect on output maroon holes (0–2) or any other property (e.g., 2 → 1 in pair 1, but 2 → 0 in pair 2; no pattern holds across all).
- **Top Small Verticals (pixels=4, y=1–4) → Output**: These consistently disappear without direct transformation, but their positions/colors may loosely influence output top fill placements (e.g., x-clustering), but this is not consistent/exact across all pairs (e.g., varying output top shapes per pair with no uniform rule).
- **Orange Frame (holes=4, y=0–5) → Output**: Consistently present in input and fully removed in output with no clear transformation or effect on any other component (no consistent connection).
- **Pixel Counts in Output Fills**: Vary (10–96) without consistent tie to input properties beyond color (e.g., no direct mapping from input shape pixels).
- **Background Bbox Variations**: Input bg y-start is usually 6 but 9 in test input (potential outlier; no effect observed in trains, so not connected).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable without forcing unrelated patterns. Elements like the test input's Light Blue bg follow the same color/properties as trains but with slightly taller bbox (y=9–29 vs. 6–24)—this does not alter the listed connections.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Interactions

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of **only** the obvious, direct interactions or connections between components/properties that are **consistent across ALL examples**. These are limited to patterns that appear identically in every train pair (e.g., same transformation rule applied uniformly, same color mapping, same positional effect). I ignored any speculative or inconsistent patterns (e.g., varying hole counts in the large maroon output do not have a clear, consistent relation to input properties like background holes or small maroon position— this is marked as unknown). No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated top small verticals with no clear output effect, or the orange frame which consistently disappears without transforming into anything specific) are included. Only elements with demonstrated interaction/effect are listed.

#### 1. **Background Color → Output Top Fills Color**
   - **Description**: The color of the large background shape (high pixels ~290–366, holes=1 or 2, bbox starting at y=6 or 9 spanning to y=24 or 29, covering full x=0–23 width) directly determines the color of multiple new rectangular fill shapes in the output (medium pixels ~10–96, holes=0, positioned at top y=0–6 or y=0–13, various x-subranges covering most of width).
   - **Consistency**: In every pair:
     - Input bg Green → Output fills Green.
     - Input bg Blue → Output fills Blue.
     - Input bg Dark Red → Output fills Dark Red.
   - **Interaction Type**: Color propagation (input bg color overwrites/effects output fill colors directly; no change to input bg shape itself).
   - **Affected Properties**: Color only (output fills have new positions/sizes, but color match is exact and consistent).

#### 2. **Shape Position (min_y >=6) → Y-Position Shift**
   - **Description**: For any non-maroon shape with holes=0, pixels=24–63 (solid rectangles, various colors/sizes), and min_y >=6 (i.e., positioned at or below the background start), all y-coordinates in the bbox are shifted upward by exactly -6 units. The shape is preserved in the output at the new position.
   - **Consistency**: Applied identically in every pair to 3–4 such shapes per input (e.g., input1: Blue [0,9,3,17] → output [0,3,3,11]; input2: Red [0,11,3,17] → [0,5,3,11]; input3: Red [0,13,2,24] → [0,7,2,18]). Never applied to top shapes (min_y <6) or maroon shapes.
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional transformation (input position effects output position; shift is uniform and predictable).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Y-coordinates: Subtract 6 from y1 and y2 (e.g., [y1,y2] → [y1-6, y2-6]).
     - Preserved: Color, holes=0, bbox width (x unchanged), height (y2-y1 unchanged), pixels (exact match).
   - **Unaffected/Excluded**: Shapes with min_y <6 (e.g., top verticals), orange frame, or any maroon shapes.

#### 3. **Small Maroon Shape → Large Output Maroon Creation**
   - **Description**: The small maroon shape (color=Maroon, holes=0, pixels=4–9, bbox narrow width ~1–3 units at x=8–13, y=13–18) causes the creation of a new large maroon structure in the output (color=Maroon, high pixels ~116–138, bbox spanning y=0–15 and most x=0–23 width, holes=0–2).
   - **Consistency**: Present and interactive in every pair (e.g., input1: [8,13,9,14] pixels=4 → output [4,0,23,15] pixels=116; input2: [8,14,9,15] pixels=4 → [4,0,23,15] pixels=124; input3: [12,17,13,18] pixels=4 → [0,0,19,15] pixels=138). The small input maroon always disappears, and the large output one always appears in its place as the only large maroon.
   - **Interaction Type**: Component transformation (input small maroon effects creation of output large maroon; acts as a "seed" or trigger).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Color: Preserved as Maroon.
     - Size/Position: Transformed to large scale (new bbox covers top-to-mid canvas y=0–15, x mostly full; input x-center ~8–12 influences output x-start ~0–4, but exact mapping varies slightly—consistent presence/effect, not precise rule).
     - Pixels: Increases significantly (from ~4–9 to ~116–138).
     - Holes: Output has holes=0–2 (unknown consistent relation to input; input always holes=0, but output varies without clear tie to other inputs like bg holes=1–2).
   - **Unaffected/Excluded**: No preservation of input small maroon; no effect on non-maroon shapes.

#### Unknowns/Non-Consistent Interactions Noted
- **Hole Count Relations**: Input background holes (1–2) have no obvious consistent effect on output maroon holes (0–2) or any other property (e.g., 2 → 1 in pair 1, but 2 → 0 in pair 2; no pattern holds across all).
- **Top Small Verticals (pixels=4, y=1–4) → Output**: These consistently disappear without direct transformation, but their positions/colors may loosely influence output top fill placements (e.g., x-clustering), but this is not consistent/exact across all pairs (e.g., varying output top shapes per pair with no uniform rule).
- **Orange Frame (holes=4, y=0–5) → Output**: Consistently present in input and fully removed in output with no clear transformation or effect on any other component (no consistent connection).
- **Pixel Counts in Output Fills**: Vary (10–96) without consistent tie to input properties beyond color (e.g., no direct mapping from input shape pixels).
- **Background Bbox Variations**: Input bg y-start is usually 6 but 9 in test input (potential outlier; no effect observed in trains, so not connected).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable without forcing unrelated patterns. Elements like the test input's Light Blue bg follow the same color/properties as trains but with slightly taller bbox (y=9–29 vs. 6–24)—this does not alter the listed connections.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 23:08:48] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    pixels = [g[r][c] for r in range(6, 24) for c in range(24) if g[r][c] != 0]
    if not pixels:
        return 0
    return Counter(pixels).most_common(1)[0][0]

def place_shifted_shapes(g: List[List[int]], new_g: List[List[int]], bg_color: int):
    # Rule: Shift non-maroon, non-background shapes (including small ones for simplicity) from rows >=6 upward by 6, but use shift 5 for rows >=21 to push bottom shapes avoiding overlap with large maroon end at row15
    for r in range(6, 24):
        shift = 5 if r >= 21 else 6
        new_r = r - shift
        if 0 <= new_r < 24:
            for c in range(24):
                cell = g[r][c]
                if cell != bg_color and cell != 0 and cell != 5 and cell != 8:
                    new_g[new_r][c] = cell

                new_g[r][c] = bg_color

def place_top_override(new_g: List[List[int]], bg_color: int):
    # Rule: For top rows 0-2 (background color propagation to top fills), override any 8's back to background color (preserves shifted shapes, creates bg fills in maroon areas; small top maroon bars unknown, so omitted)

            if new_g[r][c] == 8:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 23:10:12] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming a 24x24 grid by detecting a background color, creating a large structural "maroon" (color 8) overlay in the upper portion, shifting non-background shapes upward from the lower part of the original grid into this structure (with some exclusions and adjustments to avoid overlaps), filling remaining spaces with the background color, and applying targeted overrides to certain areas like the top rows. The goal is to produce a new grid that integrates shifted elements into a patterned maroon frame-like structure while preserving specific visual motifs from the original.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The maroon (8) structure is not a solid full-row block from rows 0-15; instead, it's a patterned frame or segmented bars (e.g., pairs of 8s separated by background color in specific columns, like cols 8-9 and 16-17 in train1, or more complex interruptions in train3), which gets partially overridden by shifted shapes but retains key segments to form a consistent "end" or boundary motif across examples.
 * Shapes to shift are non-background and non-zero, but the exclusion of color 8 (maroon) and 5 (possibly a special marker or small element) in the current program prevents placing original maroon elements or certain accents, leading to missing 8s in expected positions; subtle rule may be to shift all non-background except perhaps only exclude 0 and true background, or handle 5/8 differently per shape.
 * Shifting is mostly upward by 6 rows from original rows 6+, but with a variable shift (5 for rows >=21) to handle bottom elements without overlap; however, this doesn't account for per-shape alignment or column-specific placements, causing misalignment (e.g., in train1, shifted 1s and 4s don't align with expected positions around the maroon bars).
 * Background detection samples from rows 6-23 and non-zero cells in col 24? (code has range(24), but intent may be edge sampling); this works for uniform bgs like 3 or 1 but may fail if bg varies or has patterns.
 * Top rows (0-2) need override of maroon back to bg only in areas not intended for structure, but current full-row override erases too much (e.g., in train1 expected, top 8s remain in specific cols); subtle: overrides should be selective, perhaps only where no shifted shape or structure is present, or propagate bg only in empty top areas.
 * Bottom rows (16+) seem to receive shifted elements correctly in some cases (e.g., the 2-bar in train1 rows 16-17 matches), but in others like train2, shifted 4s and 1s are misplaced or overfilled with bg.
 * Original grid has "small ones" or accents (e.g., color 5?) that may need special handling, like omission or separate shifting, as noted in code comments but not implemented effectively.
 * Overall, the transformation creates a "scroll" or "panel" effect: upper half gets a maroon frame with inserted shifted shapes, lower half gets remaining shifted elements on bg, but must match exact patterns without overfilling 8s or misaligning shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Maroon structures vary slightly per example (e.g., full-width in lower parts of train1 row14-15, but interrupted in train3), suggesting detection or hardcoding of frame based on bg or global rules; also, some expected 8s appear in shifted positions, implying original 8s should sometimes be shifted too.
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes a fixed large maroon block, which ignores per-example frame patterns; shifting excludes too much, leading to loss of structural 8s; fill_background after shifting is good but happens too late/early in sequence for overrides.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Samples non-zero pixels from lower-right area (rows 6-23, cols 0-23 effectively) to find dominant bg color; helpful for uniform bgs but may need expansion to full grid or edge detection for patterned bgs.
    pixels = [g[r][c] for r in range(6, 24) for c in range(24) if g[r][c] != 0]
    if not pixels:
        return 0
    return Counter(pixels).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def fill_background(new_g: List[List[int]], bg_color: int):
    # Fills all 0s with bg after placing structures/shifts; this is useful and correctly sequenced in the program, as it cleans up empties without overwriting placed elements.
    for r in range(24):
        for c in range(24):
            if new_g[r][c] == 0:
                new_g[r][c] = bg_color
```

```python
def place_top_override(new_g: List[List[int]], bg_color: int):
    # Overrides 8s to bg in top 3 rows; partially helpful for bg propagation but too broad—should be conditional on positions without structure or shifts to preserve expected 8 bars.
    for r in range(3):
        for c in range(24):
            if new_g[r][c] == 8:
                new_g[r][c] = bg_color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg color (e.g., 3 in train1, 1 in train2, 7 in train3) and partially shifts bottom shapes upward (e.g., the 2-bar in train1 rows16-17 and 4-bar in train2 rows17-18 land in reasonable positions without overlap).
 * Shifting logic works for avoiding bottom overlaps (variable shift 5/6) and excluding 0/bg, but fails by excluding all 5 and 8, causing loss of accent elements and failure to place original maroons into the structure (e.g., in train3, expected has shifted 8s in mid-grid, but generated has solid 8 blocks instead).
 * Large maroon placement as full rows 0-15 is incorrect—generates solid 8 blocks that get partially overridden, but expected has sparse, paired 8s (e.g., train1 top: 8s only in cols8-9/16-17 amid bg 3s; train2: similar pairs with 8s in shifted areas like row2 cols13-20).
 * Top override erases too many 8s, leading to full bg rows 0-2 in generated (vs. expected patterned 8s in train1/2/3 tops).
 * In train1: Generated has solid 8s in rows3-15 with left 1s overriding incorrectly (full left 4 cols as 1s in rows3-11, but expected has 1s only in row3 left, then 3s interrupting 8s); bottom 2s in rows17-18 match expected positions but row16 is wrong (full 3s vs. expected empty-ish).
 * In train2: Generated shifts 2s and 3s into solid 8s but misaligns (e.g., row5 2s start at col0 over 8s, but expected has them starting col0 with 8 interruptions); top rows have misplaced 1s/6s without patterns (row0-1 full 1s left/mid 6s, but expected has 8 pairs); bottom 4s in rows17-18 match but surrounded by wrong 1s.
 * In train3: Generated has solid 8s overriding everything, with 2s shifting to row7+ but not aligning (e.g., row7 2s at col0-2 over 8s, expected has them at col0-2 with 8s starting col3); top 7s/3s in row0-2 match bg but miss 8 pairs; bottom 4s in rows17-18 match positions but row16 has wrong 2s/7s.
 * place_shifted_shapes is mostly helpful for bulk shifting but broken for exclusions (skips 8/5, causing missing elements) and doesn't handle per-column or shape-specific adjustments.
 * place_large_maroon is unhelpful/broken: assumes uniform full-width 8s, but puzzle needs patterned 8 frames (e.g., detect or hardcode bar positions based on bg); don't use this as-is in future.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of shift+bg+override sequence but misses core patterned maroon rule, leading to all INCORRECT; no object extraction function present, which might help identify shapes for precise placement (e.g., detect bars and their cols).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it has full bg 2 rows 0-2 (but with right cols22-23 as 3, mismatched), solid 8 blocks in rows3-15 (overridden only by left 1s in rows6-12), and bottom shifts like 9s full in row16-18/20-23 with partial 4s in row18, but lacks any patterned 8 frames seen in training expecteds (e.g., no paired 8s separated by bg in top/mid).
 * It overfills 8s similarly to training fails, with shifts (1s from presumed original, 9s/4s bottom) misaligned—e.g., 1s only left in rows6-12 suggest incomplete shift exclusion, and row14-15 solid 8s vs. likely expected interruptions; bottom 9s seem like a wide shifted shape but dominate too much without bg interruptions.
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: misses the "frame" motif (e.g., expected likely has 8 bars in specific cols like 4-5/12-13 or similar, with 2/3 bg patterns integrated), and right-edge 3s in top suggest bg detection issue or unhandled original elements; to fix, need patterned 8 placement and inclusive shifting of certain colors.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 23:10:29] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following lists only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **all** three training examples (input/output pairs). These are limited to properties like color, position (bbox), holes, pixels, or shape characteristics (e.g., size, isolation) that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in every case. No high-level interpretations, total solutions, or forced explanations are included. Connections that vary (e.g., exact hole counts in outputs, pixel totals, or non-uniform effects) are noted as unknown where unexplainable. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background canvas without interaction, inconsistent color mappings) are excluded.

#### 1. **Small Maroon Shape → Large Maroon Structure**
   - **Input Component**: Small, isolated Maroon shape (color=Maroon, holes=0, small bbox ~[8-12,13-17,9-13,14-18] width=1-2 height=1-2, pixels=4-9).
   - **Output Component**: Large Maroon structure (color=Maroon, holes=0-2 (unknown relation to input), bbox ≈[0-4,0,19-23,15] width≈15-19 height=15, pixels≈116-138).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The small Maroon's presence and mid-level position (y≈13-18) consistently triggers expansion/transformation into the large Maroon, which encloses or borders a significant portion of the output canvas (overlapping with translated shapes and new background-color components). Pixel increase and bbox growth are consistent, but hole count change and exact shape (e.g., frame-like) are unknown.

#### 2. **Isolated Mid/Bottom Shapes → Uniform Y-Translation**
   - **Input Components**: Multiple isolated shapes (various colors e.g., Blue/Green/Pink/Red/Yellow/Dark Red, holes=0, bboxes spanning mid y≈6-24 and bottom y≈22-24, pixels=10-63, widths=2-20 heights=1-11; excludes top small verticals, orange top bar, large background field, small Maroon).
   - **Output Components**: Same shapes (identical color, holes=0, pixels preserved exactly, x-bbox unchanged, y-bbox shifted).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These shapes consistently translate upward by exactly 6 units in y-bbox coordinates (e.g., input y-start ≈6-22 → output y-start ≈0-16), preserving all other properties (color, holes, pixels, width/height). This movement interacts with the upper canvas area (previously orange/large background), integrating them into the output layout without alteration. Number of such shapes varies (3-4), but translation rule is uniform across all.

#### 3. **Orange Top Bar + Large Background Field → Segmented Top Components of Background Color**
   - **Input Components**:
     - Orange top bar (color=Orange, holes=4, bbox=[0,0,23,5], pixels=80, horizontal full-width with holes).
     - Large background field (color=C where C=Green/Blue/Dark Red/Light Blue variants, holes=1-2, bbox≈[0,6,23,24-29], pixels=290-408, lower canvas-filling with holes).
   - **Output Components**: 3-5 new components (color=C matching large field, holes=0, bboxes at top y≈0-6-13, pixels=3-42 each, segmented horizontal widths=2-17 heights=1-6-13, total top pixels ≈80-100 approximating orange).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The orange bar's position (top y=0-5, holes=4) and the large field's color C + holes=N consistently produce segmented C components that replace/fill the orange's area at the top. Segmentation (gaps/boundaries in C components) occurs consistently, but exact pixel distribution and hole effect on segmentation (N=1-2 → variable segments) is unknown.

#### 4. **Top Small Vertical Bars → Positional Influence on Top C Segments**
   - **Input Components**: 4 small vertical bars (various colors e.g., Blue/Pink/Yellow/Red/Green, holes=0, bboxes=[varying x,1,varying x,4] width=1 height=3, pixels=4 each, positions cols≈1-22 at top y=1-4).
   - **Output Components**: The above segmented top C components (color=C, positioned as in #3).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The x-positions of the top small vertical bars (varying cols≈1-22) consistently influence the x-boundaries or gaps in the output top C segments (e.g., C segments bounded near input cols like 1/7/13/19 → output segments ≈0-7/10-15/etc.). The bars themselves disappear (no preservation of color/pixels/position), but their positional property directly affects C segmentation layout. Color of bars has no consistent effect (unknown).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., top small colors do not map to output colors uniformly; large field holes=N do not predictably alter output holes or segments; no consistent color-position mappings beyond above).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 23:13:27] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating a Python program containing a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input, following unspecified puzzle rules for interpreting or transforming the grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid elements (e.g., extracting objects, counting features like holes or blobs, matching shapes), but no specific rules are provided—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or omissions based on criteria (e.g., hole counts or stretches across grid).
 * Inputs are grids (List[List[int]]), so code must parse 2D structures accurately; outputs should match expected puzzle solutions, possibly as strings, grids, or classifications.
 * All attempts must demonstrate puzzle understanding through correct handling of training examples before test; failures indicate lack of core structure.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure function signature matches expected (e.g., def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> ...); avoid syntax errors or unrelated code that prevents execution.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle rules extracted yet, so focus on boilerplate structure first; future attempts need functions for grid traversal, object detection (e.g., connected components), and rule application.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function entirely. Placeholder for future use:
```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> list:
    # Example: Identify connected components or blobs in grid
    # (Not implemented; essential for puzzles involving object counting or shape matching)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating the code was incomplete or lacked the entry point.
 * No puzzle logic was executed, so nothing worked—zero progress on visual rules, object extraction, or output generation.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the core requirement (presence of 'program' function), making it entirely unhelpful.
 * No functions like grid parsing or object extraction were present, so none can be salvaged; avoid generating non-functional code without the main function.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR due to missing 'program' function, so it does not make sense or look correct—it failed before any puzzle processing.
 * No actual output was generated for the test input, making it impossible to verify against expected puzzle solution (e.g., no grid transformation or rule application occurred).
 * This highlights that structural compliance is prerequisite; without it, test handling (e.g., applying rules to the specific test grid) cannot be assessed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 25-row grid (including clue rows at the top) to generate a 19-row output grid by identifying background colors, placing "seeds" (marked as 8) based on clue interpretations in specific positions and rows, propagating those 8's horizontally in certain "prop" rows (based on original 8 placements or rules), and filling remaining background areas while preserving other colored elements (like 1,2,4,6,9). The goal is to complete incomplete grid sections (marked with 5 as placeholders) according to visual logic rules derived from clues, likely a custom colored fill-in puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bkg) is determined by uniform rows excluding 5's; fallback to 3 if none found—must handle cases where bkg is 1,3,7,9 across examples.
 * Clue row (g[1]) uses groups at positions [1:5,7:11,13:17,19:23]; non-0/5 values indicate colors (1,2,3,4,6) that trigger seed pair placements (consecutive positions for 8's) based on position within group (0 or 3) and color-specific rules (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may shift pair based on next group, color 1 for lower rows shifts differently).
 * Seeds are placed as pairs of 8's in upper rows (0-15, using upper pairs up to max prop row) or lower rows (switching to lower pairs after max prop); only overwrite bkg areas.
 * Propagation of 8's: In rows with original 8's (has_prop), extend left/right from min/max 8 positions and fill gaps between 8's with 8's (assuming bkg in between); subtle: only in rows 0-15, and doesn't overwrite non-bkg.
 * Upper block (initial all-bkg rows) may get right-side propagation of 8's if "plus1" condition (rightmost seed starts at group_start+1) and limited to 2 rows.
 * Lower prop rows depend on first clue color (1→rows 14-15 right-fill from leftmost lower seed; 2→rows 13-14 same); fill rightward from seed start to end if bkg.
 * Replace all 5's with bkg globally after initial copy.
 * Subtleties: Upper/lower seed computation differs (is_lower flag affects activation for color 1 at pos 0); pair starts/ends vary by color/pos (e.g., color 6 at pos 0→start+1; color 2 at pos 3→start+3, special for last group); max_group limits (3 for upper,1 for lower); preserve non-bkg colors (1,2,4,6,9) and don't propagate over them.
 * Grid is 19 output rows x 24 cols; input may have full 25 rows with clues in 0-5? but code uses g[6:25] and g[1] as clue.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only in specific rows; seeds only in bkg areas; rightmost upper prop only if is_plus1 and in upper block; lower prop only if seeds exist and specific first color; no vertical propagation.
 * Other: Original 8's in input determine has_prop and max_prop_i (last such row); fallback bkg=3 may fail if true bkg differs (e.g., 1 or 7 in ex2/ex3).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    for row in grid:
        if len(set(row)) == 1 and row[0] != 5:

```

        if pair_end < 24:
            seed_pairs.append((pair_start, pair_end))
    return seed_pairs
```
These functions handle clue parsing and seed placement core logic; they seem partially correct but need tuning for pair positions and activation (e.g., color 1 handling).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of propagation and seed placement rules.
 * Train 1: Generated missing 8's in prop rows (e.g., row 9 has 3's instead of 8's at cols 4-5 and 8-9; row 10 similar; row 11 has 3's at 4-5/8-9; row 12 has 3's at 2-3 instead of 8's; row 13 similar; upper block prop not applied correctly, leading to no right-side 8's in early rows).
 * Train 1: Lower prop not triggered (first_clue_color likely 1 or 2, but no right-fill in rows 13-15 from seeds); seeds placed but propagation gaps not filled properly.
 * Train 2: Background detection failed (used 1? but prop extended incorrectly, e.g., row 10 has 8's at 4-5/8-9/14-17 but expected 1's at 4-5; row 11 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 12 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 15 has 8's at 4-5/8-9 but expected 1's; lower prop overfills with 8's where bkg=1 should remain).
 * Train 2: Seeds placed in upper but switched to lower too early or incorrectly; prop in has_prop rows overwrote non-bkg (1's) with 8's in gaps; no handling for color 6 in clues properly.
 * Train 3: Background=7 correct, but seeds misplaced (e.g., row 0 has 8's at 8-9 but expected at 3-4; entire upper structure wrong—no 8's at expected positions like 3-4/19-20; prop in rows 4-6 overfills with 7's instead of 8's; row 7 has 2's at 0-2 but no 8's at 3-4; row 12 has 8's at 12-13 but expected full 8's row; lower rows like 16-18 have 4's starting at col 8 but bkg=7 not propagated correctly).
 * Train 3: Upper block detection failed (no initial all-bkg rows, but prop not applied to right side); lower prop not handled (first_clue_color= ? but no right-fill); pair computation for color 2/4/6 positions off (e.g., special last-group adjustment not triggering correctly).
 * Overall: compute_seed_pairs activates correctly for some colors but pair_start/end positions often wrong (e.g., shifts for color 4 based on next=2 not always accurate; color 1 lower shift to +3 misses cases); has_prop detection works but propagation doesn't stop at non-bkg or handle min/max correctly in all cases; upper/lower switch at max_prop_i too rigid; is_plus1 logic for upper right prop buggy (not triggering when needed); lower_prop_rows hardcoded to first_clue_color but may need more conditions; global 5→bkg works but applied too early, missing some placements.
 * find_background helpful but fallback=3 fails when bkg=1/7/9; get_clue_color useful for group colors.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or connected components attempted—may be needed for verifying prop boundaries, but current code assumes horizontal fills only (unhelpful for vertical or shaped elements).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it retains many unprocessed 5's across rows (e.g., row 0 all 5's; rows 1-4 copy clue-like patterns with 5's and 0's unchanged; row 5 all 5's; rows 6-8 copy 2's and 3's but no 8's placed; rows 9-11 copy 9's and 3's; rows 12-18 mix 1's/9's/3's with some 8's in row 13 cols 8-9 but incomplete; rows 19-24 all 9's or mixed but no systematic 8 propagation or bkg fill).
 * Background not detected/filled (should be 3? based on fallback or uniform rows like row 5/0, but 5's remain everywhere); no seeds placed (clue_row=g[1] has 1 at col1, 3 at10,2 at13,4 at19—should trigger upper pairs at ~cols 2-3 (for1?), 8-9/14-15/20-21? but none appear).
 * Propagation absent (e.g., no 8's extended in potential prop rows; row 13 has isolated 8's but no left/right fill; lower rows like 19-21 have 9's but no right-fill from seeds if first_clue=1).
 * Output seems like a partial copy of input g[6:25] with minimal changes (only some 5→bkg? but many 5's persist; 0's unchanged, which may be invalid—puzzle likely requires full resolution to colors/8/bkg); does not match expected logic (e.g., should place 8 pairs in upper rows based on clues, prop in rows with original 8's like row 13?, fill bkg=3 in empties, preserve 2/9/1/4 blocks).
 * Likely issues: len(g)!=25 check failed or early return; clue parsing missed (0's in groups may skip activation); no has_prop rows detected (input has no original 8's?); upper_block_start not found properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 25x24 grid where the goal is to generate a modified 19-row output (rows 6-24 of the input) by detecting a background color, interpreting clues in row 1 to place pairs of "8" elements (representing seeds or props), and applying propagations to fill ranges of 8's based on rules for upper and lower blocks, while replacing 5's with background and handling special cases like right-fills and has-prop rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bkg) is determined by the most common non-0,5,8 value in rows 6+, defaulting to 3 if none; 5's are always replaced by bkg across the output.
 * Clues in row 1 are grouped in 4-cell blocks starting at columns 1,7,13,19; each group has a key color (first non-0/5 value) at a position (0-3) that dictates pair placement for 8's: e.g., position 0 with color 4/6 or (lower and 1) activates left-leaning pairs; position 3 with 2/4/6 activates right-leaning pairs; color 3 skips activation.
 * Upper pairs (for rows 0- max_prop_i in output indexing) are computed from all 4 groups (is_lower=False); lower pairs (for rows max_prop_i+1 to 18) use first group info and original 8-range if present.
 * Propagations: "has_prop" rows (any original 8) fill 8's across min-max 8 columns; right-fill propagates 8's from a start column to end in specific upper/lower blocks; upper block is initial all-bkg rows (up to 2 for right prop); lower prop starts at row 13/14 with 2 rows of fill/propagation based on first color (1/4 triggers pair, 1/2 triggers right-fill, else has-prop).
 * Subtleties: Pair starts/ends vary by color/position (e.g., color 1 pos0 -> start+3; color 2 pos3 -> start+3 but special for last group; color 4 pos0 checks next group's color for +3 vs +1); original 8-range is min-max columns with 8 in rows 6-24; max_prop_i is highest has_prop row index; rightmost upper pair determines if +1 offset for right_fill_start; lower left_fill_start from first pair or original min.
 * Easy to miss: First group handles color 1 specially for lower; lower prop num=2 but clipped to 19; pairs only placed if activated and color !=3; output copies input rows 6-24 then modifies; invalid input returns empty list.
 * Across attempts: No full successes; common issues include over-placing 8's in non-prop areas, missing full range fills (e.g., not expanding to connect 8's properly), incorrect pair positions based on clue logic, and failing to handle block transitions (upper to lower) or special fills (right/left).

    return max(count, key=count.get) if count else 3
```
(This correctly identifies bkg by frequency, excluding specials; useful for all cases.)

```python
def get_clue_color(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> int:
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val
    return 0
```
(Extracts key color per group; helpful for pair logic, especially cross-group checks like color 4 pos0.)

```python
def get_original_eight_range(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_col = 24
    max_col = -1
    for i in range(6, 25):
        row = grid[i]
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 8:
                min_col = min(min_col, j)
                max_col = max(max_col, j)
    return min_col, max_col if max_col >= 0 else (0, -1)
```
(Finds global min-max 8 columns for lower pairs/propagations; essential for cases with pre-existing 8's.)

```python
def find_has_prop_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    has_prop = []
    for i in range(19):
        row = grid[6 + i]
        if any(cell == 8 for cell in row):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Identifies rows needing has-prop fill; useful but needs integration with max_prop_i for block split.)

```python
def propagate_has_prop(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    eight_cols = [j for j, cell in enumerate(new_row) if cell == 8]
    if not eight_cols:
        return new_row
    min_j = min(eight_cols)
    max_j = max(eight_cols)
    for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
        if new_row[j] == bkg:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```
(Fills gaps between min-max 8's in a row; core for has-prop, but unhelpful if applied too broadly without 8's present.)

```python
def is_all_bkg_row(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> bool:
    return all(cell == bkg for cell in row)
```
(Detects pure bkg rows for upper block end; helpful for limiting initial placements.)

The `compute_seed_pairs` and `get_first_group_info` functions are partially helpful for pair extraction but buggy (e.g., incomplete activation logic, special cases like gi=3 for color 2 mishandled); `place_seeds` is straightforward but overused without checks. Overall program structure (copy output, replace 5's, place then propagate) is a good skeleton but fails on block transitions and specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, bkg detection, and pair placement but fails all training examples due to incorrect propagations and pair positions.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8's in rows 7-8 (full middle fill too early) and row 9 (8's at 4-5 instead of connecting properly); missed full connection in row 7-8 (expected 0-3 as 1's unchanged, but placed 8's wrongly); lower rows 14-16 overfilled with 8's instead of partial; rows 16-18 correct for 2's but upper mismatches blob shapes (unknown why, possibly wrong upper_pairs or prop range).
 * Train 2: Generated wrong 8-range in row 2 (8's at 14-17 instead of 14-23 full); missed full 8-propagation in rows 2-3 (expected 8's to 23); row 5 has extra 8's at 16-17 where expected 1's; row 14 has 8's at 8-15 instead of none; row 15 partial 8's missing; lower rows 16-18 correct but upper prop fails to connect properly (e.g., row 8-9 should connect more).
 * Train 3: Generated wrong initial 8's in row 0-2 (3's at 8-17 instead of 8's? Wait, expected has 8's at 18-19 but generated 3's there initially?); rows 4-6 have 8's at 8-17 but expected full 0-4 8's in row 4; row 12 has 8's at 5-13 but expected none/more specific; row 13 overfills 8's at 5-13; row 14 partial but misses full 14-23 8's; lower row 16-18 has 7's at 3-4 instead of none, and 4's start too early without full prop.
 * Common misses: Over-placement of 8's in non-activated areas; incorrect block split (max_prop_i too low/high, leading to wrong upper/lower pairs); right-fill applied wrongly (e.g., starts too early or not at all); lower prop start/num hardcoded poorly (14 for 1/4 but affects fills); original 8-range not always used for lower pairs; has_prop applied universally instead of selectively.
 * Function `propagate_lower_prop_right_fill` is helpful for right-fills but unhelpful when misapplied (e.g., fills from wrong start, overfills empty rows).
 * Function `get_first_group_info` is broken for some colors (e.g., doesn't handle pos0 color=4/6 fully, leading to wrong lower pairs in Train 1/2).
 * Overall, attempt shows core structure but lacks precise clue-to-pair mapping and prop conditions; unhelpful to reuse raw `program` without fixes to activation and block logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an ERROR (invalid grid format: returned <class 'list'> instead of proper 19x24 List[List[int]]), indicating a crash likely from unhandled input dimensions, empty pairs, or index errors in propagation (e.g., pair_end >23 or max_prop_i invalid).
 * No generated grid to evaluate, but based on training failures, it would likely mismatch by over/under-placing 8's, wrong bkg replacement, or failed propagations (e.g., missing connections in has-prop rows or incorrect lower fills); does not look correct as it didn't produce output at all—must fix input validation and edge cases like no 8's or unusual clue colors to handle test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a 25-row by 24-column grid where rows 6-24 represent a drawable area with a background color, existing "8" elements (likely props or paint to propagate), and clues in upper rows (e.g., row 1) that dictate pair placements and fills of "8"s in upper (top ~half) and lower (bottom ~half) sections. The goal is to propagate and fill "8"s based on clue-derived rules for pairs, gaps, special connections, and background replacement, while preserving non-background elements like colored blocks (1-7,9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection: Scan rows 6-24, count non-0/5/8 cells, pick most common as background (default 3); replace all 5's with it. Subtle: Ignores 0/5/8 to avoid miscounting empties/props/specials, but may fail if background is rare or tied to clues.
 * Clue row parsing: Clues in row 1, divided into 4 groups of 4 cells (starts at indices 1,7,13,19). Each group has a "color" (non-0/5 value) and "position" (0-3 offset where color appears). Color=0 or 3 skips group; others trigger pair starts based on color/pos combos (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may depend on next group's color). Subtle: Last group (start 19) has edge case for pos=3/color=2 shifting to 18; pairs are always 2-wide (start to start+1), but computation varies (e.g., color 6 at pos 0 -> start+1; color 4 at pos 3 -> start+2).
 * Upper vs. lower sections: Upper is rows 0 to max_prop_i (index of last row with original 8's); lower is after. Place pairs as 8's only if the slot is all-background. Subtle: Upper uses multiple pairs from all groups; lower uses single pair from first group (with extra color=1 case at pos=0 -> start+3) or original 8-range if no special lower condition.
 * Original 8's range: Find min/max col with 8's in rows 6-24; used for lower fills if not special. Subtle: If no 8's, defaults to (24,-1) which skips.
 * Has_prop rows: Rows (0-18 relative) with any original 8; after placing pairs/seeds, fill gaps between min/max 8 in that row with 8's (connect blobs horizontally).
 * Special lower fills: For rows 14-15 (absolute 20-21?) if first group color in {1,2,4}, connect existing 8's to a target range (e.g., color=1 -> to col 23; color=2 -> from min_col to 23; color=4 -> from leftmost 8 to min_col). Subtle: Only if min_col <24 and 8's exist; applied after seeds but before/in gap fill? Order matters for connections.
 * Right fill upper: If upper pairs exist, find rightmost pair start; if it matches a computed group position and is at group_start+1, fill from that col to 24 with 8's—but only in the FIRST all-background row up to max_prop_i. Subtle: Only activates for specific cases (e.g., gi !=-1 and exact pos); seems to target a "spillover" but only once, which may miss multi-row propagation.
 * Propagation order: Replace 5's first -> compute pairs/ranges -> place seeds in upper/lower -> gap fill in has_prop rows -> special lower fills. Subtle: Gap fill only in has_prop (not all rows), and special lower overrides/reconnects based on color; no vertical propagation, only horizontal connects/fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty pairs/ranges skip; indices 0-23 cols; output is rows 6-24 modified. Subtle: Lower special skips if color not in [1,2,4]; background may be non-3 (e.g., 1 or 7 in examples); clues may have 0/5 as fillers.
 * General: Preserve non-bkg/non-8 (e.g., 1-4,6,7,9 blocks); no overwriting existing 8's; fills only on bkg slots.

```
(Helpful: Finds global 8-range for lower seeds; identifies rows needing gap fills. Essential for sectioning upper/lower and connecting.)

```python
def get_first_color(clue_row: List[int]) -> int:
    return get_group_info(clue_row, 1)[0]
```
(Helpful: Quick first-group color for special lower trigger.)

The pair computation functions (compute_upper_pairs, compute_lower_pair) are partially helpful for deriving 2-wide starts from clues but buggy (see below; overcomplicated logic misses cases). apply_right_fill_upper is unhelpful/broken (only fills one row, specific pos, doesn't propagate). Gap fill logic in main loop is helpful but limited to has_prop rows only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/only attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, background, and horizontal fills but fails all trainings due to incomplete propagation.
 * Train 1: Generated correctly places some upper pairs (e.g., 8,8 at cols 8-9 and 16-17 in early rows) and lower 2's/4's, detects bkg=3, but misses full connections in has_prop rows (e.g., row 7: generated has 8's only at 4-5? Wait, actually generated row7 [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,3,3] but expected starts 8's at col0; diff: generated delays left-fill until row8, and row11 has extra 3's vs expected 8's? Unknown why partial gap fill). Also, row12 generated has 8's at 0-1 but expected none there; special lower not triggering full right-fill in rows 14-16. Right fill didn't activate.
 * Train 2: Generated places upper pairs correctly in some rows (e.g., 8,8 at 4-5,8-9), bkg=1, but misses extending 8's in lower non-special rows (e.g., row3: generated 8's only partial vs expected full 13-23; row14: generated no 8's vs expected full connect). Lower pair computation wrong (places at wrong pos for color=6?). Special lower (rows16-18 with 4's) correct but upstream misses prevent full blobs. Gap fill skips non-has_prop or doesn't connect to min_col properly.
 * Train 3: Generated bkg=7 correctly, places some 8's (e.g., 3-4,18-19 pairs), but misses vertical consistency and full upper connects (e.g., row4: generated 8's at 8-9 but expected full 0-23 except edges; row5-6 similar partial). Has_prop gap fill incomplete (e.g., row11: generated connects some but leaves gaps at 8-17 vs expected full). Lower special not handled (rows16-18: generated 4's start at col8 but expected from col3; unknown pos miscalc). Right fill absent. Edge: row14 generated partial 8's vs expected more connects.
 * Overall: Pair logic over-relies on pos/color combos, missing spillover (e.g., color4 depending on next group often wrong). Gap fill only horizontal/per-row, no multi-row or full-section flood. Special lower misfires (wrong leftmost/to_col for colors). apply_right_fill_upper unhelpful (too narrow, only one row, didn't trigger in any train). No vertical propagation, leading to fragmented 8's. compute_lower_pair adds color=1 case but buggy (pos=0/1 overlap?). Program preserves colors well but under-fills 8's systematically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it seems to mishandle background (fills early rows 0-2 with 2's, but if bkg=3 at end, why 2's? Possible clue color leak or wrong bkg detect—clues may have 2's dominating count). Upper pairs/seeds partial (e.g., row7 has 8's at 8-10 but fragmented with 9's; expected smoother connects based on trains). Has_prop gap fill inconsistent (e.g., row13: 8's scattered with 9's gaps vs expected solid blobs). Lower special likely wrong (rows17-18: 4's at 7-15 but 8's/9's around; if first_color=4, should connect to min_col=3? but mixes with 9's). Ends with 9's, suggesting bkg=9 or un-replaced, but trains show preservation—output has too many isolated 8's and no full right-fills. Doesn't match train patterns (e.g., no solid lower 8-range); likely misses clue-dependent pairs and over-relies on original 8's which may be sparse. Unknown test clues/grid, but fragmented 8's/9's suggest broken pair computation or gap fill not extending to edges.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to generate a 19x24 output grid (rows 6-24 of the input) representing a support structure filled with 8s (beams or props) on a background color, based on clues in row 1 that dictate group-based pair placements, anchors from original 8s, propagation of fills, and special conditional rules for upper/lower sections, while replacing temporary 5s with background and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid is 25 rows by 24 columns; output must be exactly rows 6-24 (19 rows x 24 cols), with all non-8 cells set to the detected background color (most common non-0/5/8 value in output rows, defaulting to 3 if none).
 * Clue row (g[1]) is divided into 4 groups starting at columns 1,7,13,19 (each 4 cols wide); each group has a "color" (1-7, non-0/5) and "pos" (0-3 offset where color appears), which triggers specific pair placements (cols for 8-pairs) in upper (top half) or lower (bottom half) sections, with activations only for certain color-pos combos (e.g., color 1 pos 0 triggers lower pairs and left support at col 4-5; color 2/4/6 at pos 0 or 3 trigger upper pairs with offsets like +1, +3).
 * Anchor range is the min-max columns of original 8s in input rows 6-24; these must be filled with 8s across all output rows if background, but only in "has_prop" rows (those originally containing any 8).
 * Upper pairs apply to rows <= max_has_prop (upper block), lower pairs to rows > max_has_prop (lower block); special left support pairs (col 4-5) apply only to upper has_prop rows if color 1 pos 0.
 * Propagation: In has_prop rows, fill all background cells between min and max 8 positions with 8s (gap filling).
 * Special fills: If color 1 pos 0, fill cols 4+ to end with 8s in specific lower rows (14-15, 0-indexed in output); for upper right fill, if rightmost upper pair starts at group_start+1, fill cols from that start to end in the first 2 all-background upper rows.
 * Subtleties: Pairs only place if both cells are background (no overwrite); color 4 at pos 0 may skip next group if followed by color 2; background detection ignores 0/5/8; 5s are placeholders to replace with background before placing; has_prop rows are only those with original 8s, and max_prop_i is their max index (splits upper/lower); for last group (start 19), pos 3 color 2 adjusts pair_start to 18; empty groups (all 0/5) or color 3 skip pairs; propagation is per-row and only in has_prop rows; upper right fill requires detecting "plus1" starts and finding initial all-background block (may be 0-2 rows).
 * Edge cases: No original 8s means no anchors/propagation/max_prop_i=-1 (all upper pairs, no lower/left support); test input may have different dimensions or empty clues, causing format errors; overwrites must be avoided, but fills can expand existing 8s; lower right fill is narrow (only rows 14-15, cols 4+); upper block for right fill is prefix of all-background rows.

**Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `compute_lower_pairs`: Too simplistic; only handles color 1 pos 0 with fixed pair at 1+3=4, but misses broader lower rules (e.g., no pairs for other colors, and doesn't integrate with has_prop split properly; generated outputs show missing lower 8s in Train 2 rows 2-4, where expected has 8s at 13-23).
- `apply_lower_right_fill`: Hardcoded to rows 14-15 (output indices 8-9?) and cols 4+, but only if color 1 pos 0; broken for general cases, as Train 1 generated no such fill but expected subtle right 3s (not 8s); causes overfill or miss.
- `apply_upper_right_fill`: Complex but buggy; detects "plus1" but fills only first 2 all-bkg upper rows from rightmost pair start; in Train 1, it overfills right cols 22-23 with 8s in early rows (generated has 8,8 vs expected 3,3), and in Train 3, it doesn't trigger correctly, missing full right expansions.
- `place_seeds`: Attempts conditional placement but ignores full grid state; places anchors everywhere (even non-has_prop), causing overfill in lower blocks (e.g., Train 1 rows 16-18 have extra 8s in cols 4-15 where expected 2s/3s); also places pairs without checking has_prop boundaries properly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of clue parsing (groups, colors, pos) and background/anchor basics, but fails on conditional placements, propagation limits, and special fills, leading to all trainings incorrect.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8-pairs at cols 22-23 in rows 0-2,6-12 (vs expected 3,3 there, indicating overactive upper right fill or anchor expansion); rows 4-6 have 8,8 at 22-23 vs expected 3,3 or 4,4/3,3; rows 9-10 have 3,3 at 22-23 vs expected 3,3 (match) but earlier mismatches like row 8 has 4,4/3,3 vs 4,4/3,3 (partial match); row 12 has 3,3 at end vs 3,3 (match); lower rows 14-15 overfill cols 4-23 with 8s vs expected 8s only in anchor range; rows 16-18 have 2s starting at col 4 but expected same (match, but propagation missed gaps). Propagation works partially but applies anchors too broadly.
 * Train 2: Generated missing wide 8-fill in rows 2-4 cols 13-23 (has 1,1/1,1/1,1 vs expected 8s across, indicating failed lower pair or right fill trigger for color 6); row 14 has 8s cols 8-15 vs expected 8s cols 8-23 (underfill right); row 15 overfills cols 0-7 with 1s? Wait, generated 1s but expected 8s cols 0-23 partial; lower rows 16-18 match 4s but no 8-propagation into them. Upper pairs placed correctly for cols 4-5/8-9 but missed color 6 specifics (pair at 13?).
 * Train 3: Generated partial anchor fills but missed full expansions, e.g., rows 4-6 have 8s at 8-9/18-19 but expected wider 8s cols 0-7/16-19 in some; rows 11-12 have 8s cols 3-23 but expected 8s cols 3-19/6+; row 13 has 7s cols 0-2/20-23 vs expected 8s expansions; row 14 underfills cols 0-2/20-23; lower rows 16-18 have 4s cols 8-21 but expected 4s cols 8-21 with 7s edges (match but no prop). Color 2/6 triggers partial pairs but propagation doesn't connect to anchors fully; left groups (cols 0-3) have mismatched 7/2 vs expected 8 expansions.
 * Common issues: Over-placement of anchors/pairs outside has_prop (e.g., full grid anchors in Train 1 lower); incorrect upper/lower split (max_prop_i not limiting lower pairs properly, causing Train 2 underfill); special fills trigger wrongly (extra right 8s in Train 1, missing in Train 3); replace_fives works (no 5s remain) but background=3 assumed correctly; compute_upper_pairs misses skips (e.g., Train 1 color 4 pos? followed by 2?); no handling for empty has_prop (max_prop_i=-1 leads to all-upper, but Train 2 expects lower 8s).
 * get_group_info and find_background are solid (clues parsed right, bkg=3/1/7 matches inputs); place_pair is helpful but too permissive (no full conflict check beyond bkg).

**Test output:**
 * No valid generated output (ERROR: returned <class 'list'> instead of List[List[int]]); likely a bug in program() return (e.g., slicing g[6:25] fails if input !=25 rows, or empty output [] if dimensions wrong); this suggests the program assumes fixed 25x24 but test input may vary (e.g., smaller grid or non-list), causing crash—does not make sense as output, as it can't be verified; expected output unknown without rules run, but mentally: if test has unique clues (e.g., color 3 skips, or no 8s), output should be mostly bkg with minimal pairs/anchors; to fix, add dimension checks and return empty/fixed grid on error, but current crash indicates poor robustness for test case.

**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top rows (likely 0-5) represent an "above-ground" or sky area filled with background, and the content from lower rows (6+) is shifted up into a new grid. The number 8 represents a filling substance (e.g., "sand" or "growth") that originates from seed positions in the shifted content and expands vertically upward and horizontally sideways into background areas, but only in connected regions without crossing barriers (possibly number 5 acts as a barrier since it's skipped in copying). The goal is to produce a filled grid matching the expected patterns, where 8's propagate in a way that forms connected blobs, often widening horizontally at certain levels and filling "pockets" above the seeds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a fixed structure: 25 rows x 24 columns (based on output lengths), with background determined from g[6][0], suggesting row 6 is a reference for ground level or initial background.
 * Shifting: Content from rows 6+ of input g is copied to rows 0+ of output, but only non-5 values are preserved; 5's are treated as erasable or barriers (replaced with background), and top 6 rows of output are pure background— this works partially but leads to incomplete fills if expansion doesn't account for post-shift connections.
 * Seeds for 8's: Identified as positions with 8 in rows 6+ of input (shifted to 0+), collecting unique columns and the lowest (max row index) seed row; this identifies starting points but misses that expansion should connect across multiple seeds horizontally if they are at similar levels or via background.
 * Vertical expansion: Fills upward (from max_row +1 to top) only in exact seed columns if background—this is too narrow; expected outputs show 8's filling entire connected horizontal spans (e.g., widening to multiple columns) and propagating up through adjacent background cells, not just vertically in seeds.
 * Sideways expansion: Only at the specific lower_row (max seed row shifted), expanding left/right from min/max seed columns until non-background—this is limited to one row and doesn't propagate upward or connect blobs; expected shows horizontal fills at multiple rows (e.g., full-width 8's in some levels) and diagonal-ish connections.
 * Barriers and non-fills: 8's do not overwrite existing non-background numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 stay intact); only background is filled. Number 5 is skipped in initial copy, acting like a temporary barrier or void. Expansions stop at edges or other numbers. Subtle: Fills can "bridge" across background at various heights if connected to seeds via paths (e.g., in training 1, 8's extend right to col 16-17 in top rows, suggesting horizontal connectivity above seeds).
 * Connectivity: Likely requires flood-fill-like behavior (BFS/DFS from seeds upward and sideways through background only), not just linear expands— this is a key miss, as current code treats seeds independently without merging blobs. Also, fills may not go infinitely up (stops at top or barriers), and some expected patterns show 8's "hanging" or widening mid-grid.
 * Other elements: Existing shapes (e.g., 1's, 2's, 4's) remain but may get 8's filled around/above them; bottom rows in some examples have unchanged patterns (e.g., 2's in training 1). Grids may have multiple disconnected 8 blobs that need independent expansion. Easy to miss: Expansions can happen in "pockets" above barriers, and seeds might not be in every column, requiring horizontal spread before vertical.
 * All training examples failed due to under-filling: 8's didn't spread wide enough horizontally or connect across rows/columns as in expected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current functions provide a basic framework for shifting and seed detection but need enhancement for proper expansion (e.g., integrate flood fill).

```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[6][0]  # Helpful: Correctly identifies background from a fixed reference point.
```

```python
def shift_and_fill(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    out = [[background for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
    for i in range(18):  # Assumes h=24, shifts 18 rows (6+ to 24)
        for j in range(w):
            val = g[i + 6][j]
            if val != 5:
                out[i][j] = val
    return out  # Helpful: Basic shifting and 5-skipping works (preserves shapes), but top 6 rows are correctly background-filled; issue is post-shift expansion.
```

```python
def find_seed_columns_and_max_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    seed_cols = set()
    max_row = -1
    for i in range(6, h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] == 8:
                seed_cols.add(j)
                if i > max_row:
                    max_row = i
    return list(seed_cols), max_row - 6 if max_row >= 6 else -1  # Helpful: Accurately finds 8 seeds in lower input rows and computes shifted max row; useful for starting flood fill from these points.
```

The expansion functions (expand_vertical, expand_sideways) are broken/not helpful: They perform linear fills only in seed columns or at one row, missing connected region filling—do not reuse without major changes (e.g., replace with flood fill from all seeds).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single summarized attempt (the provided program); it partially understands shifting and seed detection but fails on expansion logic across all training examples.
 * Worked: Background detection is correct (matches all examples). Shifting copies non-5 content accurately (e.g., preserves 1's, 2's, 4's shapes in all trainings). Seed column collection identifies starting 8 positions correctly (e.g., cols 8-9 in training 1).
 * Didn't work: Vertical expansion too narrow (only seed cols, no horizontal connectivity upward), leading to thin 8 columns instead of wide blobs (e.g., training 1 generated 8's only in cols 8-9 top-to-mid, but expected has cols 4-5 + 8-9 + extensions to 16-17; training 2 misses cols 4-5 and wide row 2-3; training 3 misses left/right spreads from col 3-4 to wider 8's).
 * Sideways expansion limited to one row (lower_row), no propagation (e.g., training 1 generated no right extension to col 16-17 in top rows; expected connects horizontally at multiple levels. Training 2 generated no 8's in cols 4-5 or wide row 2; expected has them. Training 3 generated 8's only in cols 12-13 mid-grid, but expected has full rows 4-5 as 8's from col 0-11+).
 * Overall under-filling of 8's: Generated outputs have fewer/sparser 8's than expected (e.g., training 1: generated row 8 has 8's only cols 8-9 + some lower, expected has cols 4-17; row 12 generated no 8's in col 4-5, expected has them. Training 2: generated row 2 has 8's only cols 8-9, expected cols 4-5+8-9+14-21. Training 3: generated row 4 has 7's where expected has 8's in cols 0-3+12. Differences are consistent: lack of blob merging and upward horizontal spread).
 * No handling of multi-level connectivity or flood fill, causing isolated 8's (e.g., unknown why training 1 row 9-10 have 8's only in cols 4-5? Wait, generated has 3's there, expected 8's—likely missed vertical from adjacent seeds).
 * Function expand_vertical is unhelpful/broken: Linear per-column fill ignores horizontal neighbors (don't reuse).
 * Function expand_sideways is unhelpful/broken: Single-row expansion doesn't propagate (don't reuse).
 * find_seed_columns_and_max_row is essential/helpful: Reuse for seed detection, but expand from all seeds simultaneously via flood fill.
 * shift_and_fill is essential/helpful: Core shifting works, but ensure post-shift grid allows connected fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and shows misunderstanding of expansion rules. It has 8's only in cols 8-10 for top 3 rows (narrow, like failed vertical expand), then mostly 9's in mid-grid with isolated 8's in row 7 cols 8-10, and bottom rows with 2's and a partial 4's row (row 17 has 4's in cols 7-16, but shifted oddly). This mismatches likely expectations: Based on patterns, test input probably has seeds in lower parts (e.g., around cols 8+), requiring wide 8 fills upward into background pockets around 9's and 1's, connecting horizontally (e.g., full-width 8's mid-grid like training 3, or extensions around 9's blob). Instead, generated under-fills 8's (no wide spreads), leaves excessive 9's unfilled, and doesn't connect bottom 2's area—looks like incomplete shifting/expansion, similar to training failures (e.g., no bridging over 9's). Make sure to account for flood-filling connected background regions from all seeds upward/sideways to handle test case's probable large 9's structure and bottom 2's/4's.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 representing colors) where the top 6 rows appear to be a header or metadata, and the task is to extract and shift down the content below it, identify rectangular "panels" or blocks of uniform color (excluding background, 0, 5, 8), detect a special "maroon" (8) connector block, and then augment the layout by filling gaps and extending 8-colored borders to connect panels horizontally and vertically in a structured way, likely simulating comic panel borders or a unified strip.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background color (bg) is determined by the most common non-0/5/8 color in rows below y=6; this works but can miss if ties or edge cases occur.
 * Content blocks are only rectangles of uniform color c (1-9, excluding bg/0/5/8) larger than 4 cells, starting from the topmost row with that color; non-rectangular or small blobs are ignored, which is key but fails if blocks aren't perfectly rectangular or if detection misses partial overlaps.
 * Maroon (8) block detection expands from the first found 8 cell to its full rectangle; it's treated specially as a connector, but the code assumes only one and starts search from y=6, potentially missing if multiple or positioned oddly.
 * Output grid is the input height minus 6 rows, initialized to bg, with content blocks placed shifted up by 6 rows; this cropping and shifting is core but can clip blocks if they extend into the top 6.
 * Connections with 8: Horizontal fills in "connection rows" (where maroon overlaps after shift) between content edges and maroon; full vertical middle bar through maroon x-range; conditional left lower bar extension if content below on left; right upper bar if content above on right; bottom horizontal fill near lowest blocks, with height based on gap size (1 or 2 rows) and x-range adjusted by reach; upper right gap fills between stacked right-side blocks, limited by their heights and connection row.
 * Subtleties: 5 might be a special non-content/non-bg color (ignored in counts/blocks); connections only fill bg cells (not overwriting content); horizontal fills in connection rows set uniform x-start/end but code computes per row, leading to inconsistencies; bottom fill x-start uses left_bar if extended, else maroon start, and x-end checks if lowest blocks reach right; upper right fills only for blocks entirely right of maroon and above connection, filling from right_bar to edge but only in gaps; no overwriting of existing non-bg; assumes w is constant; potential issues with y_min=6 exactly or maroon not overlapping content vertically after shift.
 * Edge cases: No maroon (returns empty, no connections); no blocks (empty output); maroon above y=6 (clips); overlapping blocks (detection takes first topmost); small gaps (h=1 vs 2 for bottom); right-side stacks with varying heights; left/right extensions only if content "touches" bar x-range; all fills are 8-only, no other colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of connection rules.
 * Train 1: Generated correctly shifted and placed blocks (1's left, 4's right, 2's bottom), detected bg=3 and maroon at x=8-9, but missed extending 8's rightward in upper connection rows (expected 8's at x=16-17 in rows 0-6); lower left 1's connected partially but no bottom horizontal 8's under gap; rows 9-11 have 8's only in maroon without left extension to x=4; rows 12-14 missing left 8's entirely; bottom 2's placed but no connection.
 * Train 2: Generated placed blocks (2's left, 3's right, 4's bottom, 6's mid-right) and maroon at x=8-9, bg=1, but missed left 8 extensions in rows 0-4 (expected at x=0-1); row 2 has extra 8's in right but overwrote or misfilled; connection rows (likely 5-9) have partial horizontals but no full upper right 8 bar in rows 14-15; bottom 4's isolated without connection.
 * Train 3: Generated bg=7, blocks (2's left, 3's top, 4's bottom, 6's right), maroon at x=12-13, but missed left 8 extensions in early rows (expected at x=0-1 in rows 0-3); row 4 has full 8's but overwrote 3's incorrectly; middle bar partial; lower extensions missing in rows 13-16 (expected more 8's under 7's); bottom 4's connected but x-range wrong (starts too left); upper fills incomplete.
 * Block detection generally works for rectangles but may miss if not starting exactly at topmost full row or if >4 size threshold excludes small panels.
 * Maroon detection finds block but expansion assumes horizontal then vertical, which fails if irregular shape.
 * Connection logic attempts horizontals per row but sets uniform h_start/h_end incorrectly (uses first row's, ignores variations); left/right bar conditions check overlap but use wrong y-ranges post-shift; bottom horizontal gap calc uses min_y but h=1/2 based on >4 arbitrary; upper right gap fill sorts blocks but fills only to w, may overfill or underfill heights.
 * place_content_blocks clips y but doesn't handle x clipping; create_output_grid initializes correctly.
 * Overall, core shifting and block placement works in parts, but connection fills are inconsistent (e.g., no rightward extensions in train 1/2, missing vertical bars in train 3); function find_maroon_block is helpful but returns empty on no 8, skipping connections; get_background_color ignores 8 correctly but may pick wrong if sparse.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on training patterns; it shifts content down by 6 (top 3 rows of 2's become rows 0-2, bottom 4's to rows 17-19, 9's and 1's placed), detects bg likely as 3 or 9? but fills much of the grid with 9's incorrectly (e.g., rows 3-6,9-16 mostly 9's where expected might be isolated blocks), maroon at x=8-9 extended vertically but horizontals overfill (e.g., row 7 full 8's from x=3-20, but training suggests only targeted fills); right side has 8's at x=19-20 in some rows but inconsistent with expected connections; bottom rows 17-19 have 4's but surrounded by 9's instead of connected 8's; upper right (rows 20-23) all 9's with 8's, likely misbg or overfill; lacks targeted gap fills (e.g., no bottom horizontal under 1's/9's to 4's); overall too much 9-overwrite and missing precise 8-bars, doesn't match structured connections from training expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming a 24x24 grid by detecting a background color, creating a large structural "maroon" (color 8) overlay in the upper portion, shifting non-background shapes upward from the lower part of the original grid into this structure (with some exclusions and adjustments to avoid overlaps), filling remaining spaces with the background color, and applying targeted overrides to certain areas like the top rows. The goal is to produce a new grid that integrates shifted elements into a patterned maroon frame-like structure while preserving specific visual motifs from the original.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The maroon (8) structure is not a solid full-row block from rows 0-15; instead, it's a patterned frame or segmented bars (e.g., pairs of 8s separated by background color in specific columns, like cols 8-9 and 16-17 in train1, or more complex interruptions in train3), which gets partially overridden by shifted shapes but retains key segments to form a consistent "end" or boundary motif across examples.
 * Shapes to shift are non-background and non-zero, but the exclusion of color 8 (maroon) and 5 (possibly a special marker or small element) in the current program prevents placing original maroon elements or certain accents, leading to missing 8s in expected positions; subtle rule may be to shift all non-background except perhaps only exclude 0 and true background, or handle 5/8 differently per shape.
 * Shifting is mostly upward by 6 rows from original rows 6+, but with a variable shift (5 for rows >=21) to handle bottom elements without overlap; however, this doesn't account for per-shape alignment or column-specific placements, causing misalignment (e.g., in train1, shifted 1s and 4s don't align with expected positions around the maroon bars).
 * Background detection samples from rows 6-23 and non-zero cells in col 24? (code has range(24), but intent may be edge sampling); this works for uniform bgs like 3 or 1 but may fail if bg varies or has patterns.
 * Top rows (0-2) need override of maroon back to bg only in areas not intended for structure, but current full-row override erases too much (e.g., in train1 expected, top 8s remain in specific cols); subtle: overrides should be selective, perhaps only where no shifted shape or structure is present, or propagate bg only in empty top areas.
 * Bottom rows (16+) seem to receive shifted elements correctly in some cases (e.g., the 2-bar in train1 rows 16-17 matches), but in others like train2, shifted 4s and 1s are misplaced or overfilled with bg.
 * Original grid has "small ones" or accents (e.g., color 5?) that may need special handling, like omission or separate shifting, as noted in code comments but not implemented effectively.
 * Overall, the transformation creates a "scroll" or "panel" effect: upper half gets a maroon frame with inserted shifted shapes, lower half gets remaining shifted elements on bg, but must match exact patterns without overfilling 8s or misaligning shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Maroon structures vary slightly per example (e.g., full-width in lower parts of train1 row14-15, but interrupted in train3), suggesting detection or hardcoding of frame based on bg or global rules; also, some expected 8s appear in shifted positions, implying original 8s should sometimes be shifted too.
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes a fixed large maroon block, which ignores per-example frame patterns; shifting excludes too much, leading to loss of structural 8s; fill_background after shifting is good but happens too late/early in sequence for overrides.

            if new_g[r][c] == 0:

```

```python
def place_top_override(new_g: List[List[int]], bg_color: int):
    # Overrides 8s to bg in top 3 rows; partially helpful for bg propagation but too broad—should be conditional on positions without structure or shifts to preserve expected 8 bars.
    for r in range(3):
        for c in range(24):
            if new_g[r][c] == 8:
                new_g[r][c] = bg_color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg color (e.g., 3 in train1, 1 in train2, 7 in train3) and partially shifts bottom shapes upward (e.g., the 2-bar in train1 rows16-17 and 4-bar in train2 rows17-18 land in reasonable positions without overlap).
 * Shifting logic works for avoiding bottom overlaps (variable shift 5/6) and excluding 0/bg, but fails by excluding all 5 and 8, causing loss of accent elements and failure to place original maroons into the structure (e.g., in train3, expected has shifted 8s in mid-grid, but generated has solid 8 blocks instead).
 * Large maroon placement as full rows 0-15 is incorrect—generates solid 8 blocks that get partially overridden, but expected has sparse, paired 8s (e.g., train1 top: 8s only in cols8-9/16-17 amid bg 3s; train2: similar pairs with 8s in shifted areas like row2 cols13-20).
 * Top override erases too many 8s, leading to full bg rows 0-2 in generated (vs. expected patterned 8s in train1/2/3 tops).
 * In train1: Generated has solid 8s in rows3-15 with left 1s overriding incorrectly (full left 4 cols as 1s in rows3-11, but expected has 1s only in row3 left, then 3s interrupting 8s); bottom 2s in rows17-18 match expected positions but row16 is wrong (full 3s vs. expected empty-ish).
 * In train2: Generated shifts 2s and 3s into solid 8s but misaligns (e.g., row5 2s start at col0 over 8s, but expected has them starting col0 with 8 interruptions); top rows have misplaced 1s/6s without patterns (row0-1 full 1s left/mid 6s, but expected has 8 pairs); bottom 4s in rows17-18 match but surrounded by wrong 1s.
 * In train3: Generated has solid 8s overriding everything, with 2s shifting to row7+ but not aligning (e.g., row7 2s at col0-2 over 8s, expected has them at col0-2 with 8s starting col3); top 7s/3s in row0-2 match bg but miss 8 pairs; bottom 4s in rows17-18 match positions but row16 has wrong 2s/7s.
 * place_shifted_shapes is mostly helpful for bulk shifting but broken for exclusions (skips 8/5, causing missing elements) and doesn't handle per-column or shape-specific adjustments.
 * place_large_maroon is unhelpful/broken: assumes uniform full-width 8s, but puzzle needs patterned 8 frames (e.g., detect or hardcode bar positions based on bg); don't use this as-is in future.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of shift+bg+override sequence but misses core patterned maroon rule, leading to all INCORRECT; no object extraction function present, which might help identify shapes for precise placement (e.g., detect bars and their cols).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it has full bg 2 rows 0-2 (but with right cols22-23 as 3, mismatched), solid 8 blocks in rows3-15 (overridden only by left 1s in rows6-12), and bottom shifts like 9s full in row16-18/20-23 with partial 4s in row18, but lacks any patterned 8 frames seen in training expecteds (e.g., no paired 8s separated by bg in top/mid).
 * It overfills 8s similarly to training fails, with shifts (1s from presumed original, 9s/4s bottom) misaligned—e.g., 1s only left in rows6-12 suggest incomplete shift exclusion, and row14-15 solid 8s vs. likely expected interruptions; bottom 9s seem like a wide shifted shape but dominate too much without bg interruptions.
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: misses the "frame" motif (e.g., expected likely has 8 bars in specific cols like 4-5/12-13 or similar, with 2/3 bg patterns integrated), and right-edge 3s in top suggest bg detection issue or unhandled original elements; to fix, need patterned 8 placement and inclusive shifting of certain colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following lists only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **all** three training examples (input/output pairs). These are limited to properties like color, position (bbox), holes, pixels, or shape characteristics (e.g., size, isolation) that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in every case. No high-level interpretations, total solutions, or forced explanations are included. Connections that vary (e.g., exact hole counts in outputs, pixel totals, or non-uniform effects) are noted as unknown where unexplainable. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background canvas without interaction, inconsistent color mappings) are excluded.

#### 1. **Small Maroon Shape → Large Maroon Structure**
   - **Input Component**: Small, isolated Maroon shape (color=Maroon, holes=0, small bbox ~[8-12,13-17,9-13,14-18] width=1-2 height=1-2, pixels=4-9).
   - **Output Component**: Large Maroon structure (color=Maroon, holes=0-2 (unknown relation to input), bbox ≈[0-4,0,19-23,15] width≈15-19 height=15, pixels≈116-138).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The small Maroon's presence and mid-level position (y≈13-18) consistently triggers expansion/transformation into the large Maroon, which encloses or borders a significant portion of the output canvas (overlapping with translated shapes and new background-color components). Pixel increase and bbox growth are consistent, but hole count change and exact shape (e.g., frame-like) are unknown.

#### 2. **Isolated Mid/Bottom Shapes → Uniform Y-Translation**
   - **Input Components**: Multiple isolated shapes (various colors e.g., Blue/Green/Pink/Red/Yellow/Dark Red, holes=0, bboxes spanning mid y≈6-24 and bottom y≈22-24, pixels=10-63, widths=2-20 heights=1-11; excludes top small verticals, orange top bar, large background field, small Maroon).
   - **Output Components**: Same shapes (identical color, holes=0, pixels preserved exactly, x-bbox unchanged, y-bbox shifted).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These shapes consistently translate upward by exactly 6 units in y-bbox coordinates (e.g., input y-start ≈6-22 → output y-start ≈0-16), preserving all other properties (color, holes, pixels, width/height). This movement interacts with the upper canvas area (previously orange/large background), integrating them into the output layout without alteration. Number of such shapes varies (3-4), but translation rule is uniform across all.

#### 3. **Orange Top Bar + Large Background Field → Segmented Top Components of Background Color**
   - **Input Components**:
     - Orange top bar (color=Orange, holes=4, bbox=[0,0,23,5], pixels=80, horizontal full-width with holes).
     - Large background field (color=C where C=Green/Blue/Dark Red/Light Blue variants, holes=1-2, bbox≈[0,6,23,24-29], pixels=290-408, lower canvas-filling with holes).
   - **Output Components**: 3-5 new components (color=C matching large field, holes=0, bboxes at top y≈0-6-13, pixels=3-42 each, segmented horizontal widths=2-17 heights=1-6-13, total top pixels ≈80-100 approximating orange).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The orange bar's position (top y=0-5, holes=4) and the large field's color C + holes=N consistently produce segmented C components that replace/fill the orange's area at the top. Segmentation (gaps/boundaries in C components) occurs consistently, but exact pixel distribution and hole effect on segmentation (N=1-2 → variable segments) is unknown.

#### 4. **Top Small Vertical Bars → Positional Influence on Top C Segments**
   - **Input Components**: 4 small vertical bars (various colors e.g., Blue/Pink/Yellow/Red/Green, holes=0, bboxes=[varying x,1,varying x,4] width=1 height=3, pixels=4 each, positions cols≈1-22 at top y=1-4).
   - **Output Components**: The above segmented top C components (color=C, positioned as in #3).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The x-positions of the top small vertical bars (varying cols≈1-22) consistently influence the x-boundaries or gaps in the output top C segments (e.g., C segments bounded near input cols like 1/7/13/19 → output segments ≈0-7/10-15/etc.). The bars themselves disappear (no preservation of color/pixels/position), but their positional property directly affects C segmentation layout. Color of bars has no consistent effect (unknown).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., top small colors do not map to output colors uniformly; large field holes=N do not predictably alter output holes or segments; no consistent color-position mappings beyond above).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input result: ERROR - Program returned invalid grid format: <class 'list'>
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 23:29:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes a 25x24 input grid (with clues in row 1 and a 19x24 working area starting from row 6) to output a completed 19x24 grid by identifying background colors, detecting and propagating special "8" elements (likely representing propagatable or filled areas), placing seed pairs of 8s based on clue groups in row 1, and applying conditional fills in upper/lower/right sections. The puzzle involves color-coded rules for activating and positioning pairs, handling "property" rows (those containing 8s), and ensuring background (bkg) cells are overwritten only under specific conditions, resembling a constrained paint-by-numbers or blob-filling puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bkg) is the most common non-0/5/8 color in the working grid (rows 6-24); 5s are always replaced by bkg early on, but 0s and 8s are preserved or used as seeds.
 * Clue row (g[1]) has 4 groups starting at columns 1,7,13,19 (each 4 cells wide); each group has a key color (first non-0/5 value) that determines activation and pair positioning—e.g., color 1 in lower context or 4/6 in pos 0 activates left-leaning pairs, 2/4/6 in pos 3 activates right-leaning pairs; color 3 is neutral/inactive.
 * Seed pairs are computed separately for "upper" (first 3 groups, max_group=3, is_lower=False) and "lower" (last group or subsets, max_group=1, is_lower=True); pairs are 2-cell adjacent 8s placed at specific offsets (e.g., +1, +2, +3 from group start) based on color/position, with special handling like pair_start=18 for last group if color=2.
 * "has_prop" rows are indices i (0-18 for output rows 0-18) where input row 6+i contains any 8; max_prop_i is the highest such i, dividing the grid into upper (0 to max_prop_i) and lower (max_prop_i+1 to 18) sections for pair placement—upper uses upper_pairs, lower uses lower_pairs; additionally, all has_prop rows get lower_pairs overlaid.
 * Propagation: In has_prop rows, fill all bkg cells between the min and max column with 8s (horizontal expansion); this must happen after initial placements but before some fills.
 * Upper right fill: Find the first all-bkg row (upper_block_start) from row 0; fill min(2, remaining rows) starting there, from the rightmost upper pair start to col 23 with 8s, but only if the rightmost pair is at group_start+1 (is_plus1=True).
 * Lower right fill: If first group color is 1 or 2, start fill at row 13 (for 2) or 14 (for 1), for 2 rows, from the leftmost lower pair start to col 23 with 8s.
 * Subtleties: Pair activation skips if color=3 or no key color; lower pairs may override upper in overlap; propagation can expand existing 8s but only fills bkg (not overwriting other colors like 1/2/4/6/7); all-bkg checks use temp_output to avoid interference from prior placements; grid must be exactly 19x24 output with valid ints (error if not); existing non-bkg colors (e.g., 1,2,4,6,7) in output are preserved and not overwritten by 8s.
 * Edge cases: No has_prop means max_prop_i=-1, so upper covers all; empty pairs skip placements; last group (col 19-22) has off-by-one adjustments (e.g., pair_end <24); if no count in bkg detection, default to 3.
 * Common misses: Over-propagating 8s into non-bkg areas; wrong pair offsets (e.g., assuming fixed positions); not separating upper/lower logic properly; fills applying unconditionally; failing to preserve existing colors like 1/2/4 in expected outputs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = Counter()
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in [0, 5, 8]:
                count[cell] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 3
```
(Helpful for bkg detection, correctly excludes 0/5/8 and defaults to 3; used accurately in attempts.)

```python
def get_clue_color(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> int:
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val
    return 0
```
(Helpful for extracting key color per group; simple and correct, used for first_color and next_color checks.)

```python
def compute_seed_pairs(clue_row: List[int], is_lower: bool, max_group: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    group_starts = [1, 7, 13, 19]

        group = clue_row[start:start + 4]
        color_pos = -1
        color = 0
        for p in range(4):
            val = group[p]
            if val not in [0, 5]:
                color_pos = p
                color = val
                break
        activate = False
        if color_pos != -1 and color != 3:
            if color_pos == 0:
                if color in [4, 6] or (is_lower and color == 1):
                    activate = True
            elif color_pos == 3:
                if color in [2, 4, 6]:
                    activate = True
        if not activate:
            continue
        if color_pos == 0:
            if color == 6 or (color == 1 and is_lower):
                pair_start = start + 1
            elif color == 4:
                next_color = 0
                if gi < 3:
                    next_start = group_starts[gi + 1]
                    next_color = get_clue_color(clue_row, next_start)
                if next_color == 2:
                    pair_start = start + 3
                else:
                    pair_start = start + 1
            else:  # color == 1 and is_lower
                pair_start = start + 3
        else:  # color_pos == 3
            if color == 2:
                pair_start = start + 3
                if start == 19:
                    pair_start = 18
            elif color == 4:
                pair_start = start + 2
            elif color == 6:
                pair_start = start + 1
        pair_end = pair_start + 1
        if pair_end < 24:
            seed_pairs.append((pair_start, pair_end))
    return seed_pairs
```
(Helpful core for pair computation; captures activation rules and position logic, including lower-specific tweaks and next-group dependencies; partial success in placing some pairs correctly across examples.)

```python
def get_has_prop_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    has_prop = []
    for i in range(19):
        if any(cell == 8 for cell in grid[6 + i]):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Helpful for identifying propagation rows; simple and correct, essential for section division.)

```python
def propagate_has_prop(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    eight_cols = [j for j, cell in enumerate(new_row) if cell == 8]
    if not eight_cols:
        return new_row
    min_j = min(eight_cols)
    max_j = max(eight_cols)
    for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
        if new_row[j] == bkg:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```
(Helpful for horizontal 8 expansion; correctly targets only bkg between 8s; applied too late or not at all in some mismatches.)

```python
def is_all_bkg_row(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> bool:
    return all(cell == bkg for cell in row)
```
(Helpful for finding upper_block_start; used with temp_output to avoid placement interference—key subtlety.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented core structure (bkg detection, pair computation, has_prop detection, propagation, sectioned placements, conditional fills) but all training examples failed due to incorrect 8 placements and expansions.
 * Train 1: Correctly placed some upper pairs (e.g., 8s at cols 8-9 and 16-17 in rows 0-6) and lower pairs (e.g., cols 2-3 in rows 12-14), but failed to propagate 8s into cols 4-7 in rows 7-8 (generated 3s, expected 8s); over-placed 8s in row 6 cols 16-17 (should be 3s); wrong lower fill starting too early (cols 18-21 got 4s but no right-fill 8s); row 12 has extra 8s at 2-3 (not expected); propagation missed in row 14 (cols 4-23 should be 8s but partial).
 * Train 2: Partially correct upper pairs (e.g., 8s at 4-5,8-9 in early rows), but wrong in row 2 cols 13-19 (generated 1/8s, expected 8s across); lower section misplacements (e.g., row 10 has 8s at 4-15 but expected 1s at 4-7); row 12 has extra 8s at 0-3/20-23 (expected 1s); propagation failed in row 14 (cols 8-23 should be 8s); lower fill in rows 16-18 placed 8 at col 5 incorrectly (expected 1s there).
 * Train 3: Good initial pairs (e.g., 8s at 3-4,18-19 in rows 0-3), but failed upper propagation (rows 4-6 should have 8s at 8-17 but generated 7s/8s mismatched); row 6 has extra 8s at 0-3 (expected 7s); row 11 has 8s at 5-17 (expected partial); lower fill in rows 16-18 placed 8 at col 3 (expected 7); propagation in row 14 missed expanding to cols 20-23.
 * Pair logic worked partially (some expected 8 pairs match, like in train1 cols 8-9), but activation/offset rules are buggy (e.g., color=4 with next=2 not triggering +3 correctly; lower color=1 not always +3).
 * Section division via max_prop_i is helpful but misapplied—upper/lower placements overlap incorrectly, and has_prop overlay adds extras without checks.
 * Fills are over-aggressive: upper right applies even without is_plus1 in some cases; lower right uses wrong left_start (min pair instead of fixed).
 * Propagation is applied only to has_prop rows post-placement, but timing causes misses (e.g., needs re-propagation after fills?); doesn't handle vertical propagation.
 * Overall, preserves existing colors correctly (e.g., 1/2/4/6/7 not overwritten), but 8s overwrite bkg too selectively.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, though compute_seed_pairs has subtle bugs in offsets (e.g., for color=2 at end).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output provided—program errored with invalid format (<class 'list'>, likely returned [] or non-List[List[int]] due to early return if len(g)!=25 or len(g[0])!=24, suggesting test input didn't match expected dimensions).
 * Without output, cannot verify correctness, but based on training failures, it likely would mismatch: partial pairs/fills/propagation as seen in trains, potentially missing test-specific clues (e.g., unique color_pos or no has_prop). Test probably requires robust dimension check and default handling; error indicates lack of graceful fallbacks, making output unusable—does not look correct due to crash.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 23:30:15] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 23:32:45] Response:
### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties that appear in **every** train example (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). These are limited to direct, repeatable effects or transformations (e.g., position changes, expansions, or splittings) that hold across all cases without variation in the core mechanism. Irrelevant or static elements (e.g., the orange top frame, which appears unchanged in inputs but is absent in outputs with no observed effect on other components) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear effects (e.g., exact hole count changes, pixel totals in splits, or color influences from top small blocks) are noted as unknown where they cannot be directly linked. No high-level interpretation or solution is provided; only pairwise component/property connections are listed.

#### 1. **Mid-level colored blocks (non-base, non-Maroon, pixels 24-63, holes=0) → Position transformation (y-shift)**
   - **Description**: These are rectangular or block-like components (e.g., horizontal bars or vertical strips) positioned in the mid-to-lower input area (y-ranges typically 6-24, excluding top y=1-4 and base). In every output, each such block retains its color, pixel count, width (x-range), height (y-range span), and holes=0, but is translated upward by exactly 6 units (all y-coordinates in bbox decreased by 6, potentially clipping or adjusting to y=0 boundary).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs for 3-4 such blocks per example (e.g., Yellow, Red, Green, Pink, Blue variants). Examples:
     - Train 1: Yellow [18,10,21,16] p=28 → [18,4,21,10] p=28; Red [4,22,14,24] p=33 → [4,16,14,18] p=33; Blue [0,9,3,17] p=36 → [0,3,3,11] p=36.
     - Train 2: Pink [13,6,17,7] p=10 → [13,0,17,1] p=10; Green [16,11,19,16] p=24 → [16,5,19,10] p=24; Red [0,11,3,17] p=28 → [0,5,3,11] p=28; Yellow [5,22,12,24] p=24 → [5,16,12,18] p=24.
     - Train 3: Green [8,6,17,9] p=40 → [8,0,17,3] p=40; Pink [20,9,23,19] p=44 → [20,3,23,13] p=44; Red [0,13,2,24] p=36 → [0,7,2,18] p=36; Yellow [8,22,21,24] p=42 → [8,16,21,18] p=42.
   - **Interconnection**: Input position (specifically y-bbox) directly effects output position (y-bbox shift). No effect on x-bbox, color, or size. This does not apply to top small blocks, base, or Maroon.

#### 2. **Small Maroon block (holes=0, bbox ~[8-12,13-18], pixels=4-9) → Size/position expansion**
   - **Description**: A single small, near-square Maroon component in the mid-lower input (always present, variable slight x/y position but consistent size/color). In every output, it expands into one large Maroon component that covers a broad horizontal area (x-range spanning most of 0-23, y-range fixed from 0 to ~15), increasing pixels to ~116-138. Holes change to 0-2 (unknown determination—varies without clear link to input properties like base holes or top positions).
   - **Consistency**: Always one input → one output Maroon; expansion mechanism (growth in area/bbox) is identical, though exact x-start (0-4) and holes vary slightly. Examples:
     - Train 1: [8,13,9,14] p=4 → [4,0,23,15] p=116 h=1.
     - Train 2: [8,14,9,15] p=4 → [4,0,23,15] p=124 h=0.
     - Train 3: [12,17,13,18] p=4 → [0,0,19,15] p=138 h=2.
   - **Interconnection**: Input position/size (small, localized) effects output position/size (large, top-anchored expansion). Color preserved. No observed direct effect on other components' colors or positions, but output bbox overlaps shifted mid-blocks in y=0-15 range (potential spatial interaction, but mechanism unknown).

#### 3. **Large base layer (holes=1-2, bbox ~[0,6-9,23,24+], pixels=290-408, variable color) → Splitting into multiple same-color components**
   - **Description**: The expansive base area (always one per input, covering bottom ~2/3 of grid, with holes=1-2). In every output, it splits into 4-6 smaller components of the *same color* (holes=0 for most), repositioned primarily at top (y=0-6) and sides/mid (y=4-18), with reduced total pixels (~200-250 aggregate, unknown loss mechanism). Bbox fragments vary (some vertical, some horizontal, widths 3-13 units).
   - **Consistency**: Always base color preserved and multiplied/fragmented; top fragments (y~0-6) always present (2-3 per output). Examples (base color noted):
     - Train 1 (Green base h=2 p=355) → 5 Green fragments h=0 (e.g., [0,0,7,6] p=40, [10,0,15,6] p=42, [10,0,23,13] p=96; total p~216).
     - Train 2 (Blue base h=2 p=366) → 6 Blue fragments h=0 (e.g., [0,0,3,4] p=20, [6,0,7,7] p=16, [10,0,13,7] p=30, [10,4,23,13] p=80; total p~226).
     - Train 3 (Dark Red base h=1 p=290) → 8 Dark Red fragments h=0 (e.g., [20,0,23,2] p=12, [0,0,2,3] p=12, [5,0,7,3] p=12, [0,6,2,6] p=3; total p~149).
   - **Interconnection**: Input holes/pixels/bbox (singular, bottom-heavy) effects output count/positions/sizes (multiple, top/side-distributed, same color). Exact split rules (e.g., how input holes=1-2 → output holes=0; pixel reduction; fragment shapes) unknown—no consistent link to other input properties like top positions or Maroon.

#### 4. **Top small vertical blocks (4 per input, holes=0, bbox ~[x,1,x,4], pixels=4 each, variable colors/positions) → Absence with indirect position/color influence (unknown)**
   - **Description**: Always exactly 4 narrow vertical blocks at fixed y=1-4, variable x (e.g., 1,7,13,19) and colors (e.g., Blue/Pink/Yellow/Red/Green). They do not appear in outputs in their original form (no direct shift or preservation). However, outputs consistently introduce 2-3 new small top components (y=0-3, pixels=10-12, base color) whose x-positions roughly align with or between input top x-values (e.g., gaps or clusters at x=0-7,10-15).
   - **Consistency**: Always 4 input → 0 direct outputs, but new top fragments in base color appear in similar x-regions. Examples:
     - Train 1 (x=1,7,13,19) → Output top Greens at x=0-7,10-15 (overlapping input x-clusters).
     - Train 2 (x=4,7,16,19) → Output top Blues at x=0-3,6-7,10-13,18-23 (spanning input x).
     - Train 3 (x=4,7,13,22) → Output top Dark Reds at x=0-2,5-7,20-23 (matching/near input x).
   - **Interconnection**: Input positions (x-values) and colors effect output top fragment positions (x-clustering in base color), but exact mapping (e.g., which color goes where; why base color used) unknown. No preservation of their own colors or y-shift.

No other consistent interactions observed (e.g., no reliable color-to-color effects, hole-to-position links, or pixel-based transformations across all examples). Elements like black voids or purple/green accents from the description are not present in the data, so no connections identifiable.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 23:32:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating a Python program containing a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input, following unspecified puzzle rules for interpreting or transforming the grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid elements (e.g., extracting objects, counting features like holes or blobs, matching shapes), but no specific rules are provided—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or omissions based on criteria (e.g., hole counts or stretches across grid).
 * Inputs are grids (List[List[int]]), so code must parse 2D structures accurately; outputs should match expected puzzle solutions, possibly as strings, grids, or classifications.
 * All attempts must demonstrate puzzle understanding through correct handling of training examples before test; failures indicate lack of core structure.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure function signature matches expected (e.g., def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> ...); avoid syntax errors or unrelated code that prevents execution.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle rules extracted yet, so focus on boilerplate structure first; future attempts need functions for grid traversal, object detection (e.g., connected components), and rule application.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function entirely. Placeholder for future use:
```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> list:
    # Example: Identify connected components or blobs in grid
    # (Not implemented; essential for puzzles involving object counting or shape matching)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating the code was incomplete or lacked the entry point.
 * No puzzle logic was executed, so nothing worked—zero progress on visual rules, object extraction, or output generation.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the core requirement (presence of 'program' function), making it entirely unhelpful.
 * No functions like grid parsing or object extraction were present, so none can be salvaged; avoid generating non-functional code without the main function.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR due to missing 'program' function, so it does not make sense or look correct—it failed before any puzzle processing.
 * No actual output was generated for the test input, making it impossible to verify against expected puzzle solution (e.g., no grid transformation or rule application occurred).
 * This highlights that structural compliance is prerequisite; without it, test handling (e.g., applying rules to the specific test grid) cannot be assessed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 25-row grid (including clue rows at the top) to generate a 19-row output grid by identifying background colors, placing "seeds" (marked as 8) based on clue interpretations in specific positions and rows, propagating those 8's horizontally in certain "prop" rows (based on original 8 placements or rules), and filling remaining background areas while preserving other colored elements (like 1,2,4,6,9). The goal is to complete incomplete grid sections (marked with 5 as placeholders) according to visual logic rules derived from clues, likely a custom colored fill-in puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bkg) is determined by uniform rows excluding 5's; fallback to 3 if none found—must handle cases where bkg is 1,3,7,9 across examples.
 * Clue row (g[1]) uses groups at positions [1:5,7:11,13:17,19:23]; non-0/5 values indicate colors (1,2,3,4,6) that trigger seed pair placements (consecutive positions for 8's) based on position within group (0 or 3) and color-specific rules (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may shift pair based on next group, color 1 for lower rows shifts differently).
 * Seeds are placed as pairs of 8's in upper rows (0-15, using upper pairs up to max prop row) or lower rows (switching to lower pairs after max prop); only overwrite bkg areas.
 * Propagation of 8's: In rows with original 8's (has_prop), extend left/right from min/max 8 positions and fill gaps between 8's with 8's (assuming bkg in between); subtle: only in rows 0-15, and doesn't overwrite non-bkg.
 * Upper block (initial all-bkg rows) may get right-side propagation of 8's if "plus1" condition (rightmost seed starts at group_start+1) and limited to 2 rows.
 * Lower prop rows depend on first clue color (1→rows 14-15 right-fill from leftmost lower seed; 2→rows 13-14 same); fill rightward from seed start to end if bkg.
 * Replace all 5's with bkg globally after initial copy.
 * Subtleties: Upper/lower seed computation differs (is_lower flag affects activation for color 1 at pos 0); pair starts/ends vary by color/pos (e.g., color 6 at pos 0→start+1; color 2 at pos 3→start+3, special for last group); max_group limits (3 for upper,1 for lower); preserve non-bkg colors (1,2,4,6,9) and don't propagate over them.
 * Grid is 19 output rows x 24 cols; input may have full 25 rows with clues in 0-5? but code uses g[6:25] and g[1] as clue.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only in specific rows; seeds only in bkg areas; rightmost upper prop only if is_plus1 and in upper block; lower prop only if seeds exist and specific first color; no vertical propagation.
 * Other: Original 8's in input determine has_prop and max_prop_i (last such row); fallback bkg=3 may fail if true bkg differs (e.g., 1 or 7 in ex2/ex3).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

            seed_pairs.append((pair_start, pair_end))
    return seed_pairs
```
These functions handle clue parsing and seed placement core logic; they seem partially correct but need tuning for pair positions and activation (e.g., color 1 handling).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of propagation and seed placement rules.
 * Train 1: Generated missing 8's in prop rows (e.g., row 9 has 3's instead of 8's at cols 4-5 and 8-9; row 10 similar; row 11 has 3's at 4-5/8-9; row 12 has 3's at 2-3 instead of 8's; row 13 similar; upper block prop not applied correctly, leading to no right-side 8's in early rows).
 * Train 1: Lower prop not triggered (first_clue_color likely 1 or 2, but no right-fill in rows 13-15 from seeds); seeds placed but propagation gaps not filled properly.
 * Train 2: Background detection failed (used 1? but prop extended incorrectly, e.g., row 10 has 8's at 4-5/8-9/14-17 but expected 1's at 4-5; row 11 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 12 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 15 has 8's at 4-5/8-9 but expected 1's; lower prop overfills with 8's where bkg=1 should remain).
 * Train 2: Seeds placed in upper but switched to lower too early or incorrectly; prop in has_prop rows overwrote non-bkg (1's) with 8's in gaps; no handling for color 6 in clues properly.
 * Train 3: Background=7 correct, but seeds misplaced (e.g., row 0 has 8's at 8-9 but expected at 3-4; entire upper structure wrong—no 8's at expected positions like 3-4/19-20; prop in rows 4-6 overfills with 7's instead of 8's; row 7 has 2's at 0-2 but no 8's at 3-4; row 12 has 8's at 12-13 but expected full 8's row; lower rows like 16-18 have 4's starting at col 8 but bkg=7 not propagated correctly).
 * Train 3: Upper block detection failed (no initial all-bkg rows, but prop not applied to right side); lower prop not handled (first_clue_color= ? but no right-fill); pair computation for color 2/4/6 positions off (e.g., special last-group adjustment not triggering correctly).
 * Overall: compute_seed_pairs activates correctly for some colors but pair_start/end positions often wrong (e.g., shifts for color 4 based on next=2 not always accurate; color 1 lower shift to +3 misses cases); has_prop detection works but propagation doesn't stop at non-bkg or handle min/max correctly in all cases; upper/lower switch at max_prop_i too rigid; is_plus1 logic for upper right prop buggy (not triggering when needed); lower_prop_rows hardcoded to first_clue_color but may need more conditions; global 5→bkg works but applied too early, missing some placements.
 * find_background helpful but fallback=3 fails when bkg=1/7/9; get_clue_color useful for group colors.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or connected components attempted—may be needed for verifying prop boundaries, but current code assumes horizontal fills only (unhelpful for vertical or shaped elements).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it retains many unprocessed 5's across rows (e.g., row 0 all 5's; rows 1-4 copy clue-like patterns with 5's and 0's unchanged; row 5 all 5's; rows 6-8 copy 2's and 3's but no 8's placed; rows 9-11 copy 9's and 3's; rows 12-18 mix 1's/9's/3's with some 8's in row 13 cols 8-9 but incomplete; rows 19-24 all 9's or mixed but no systematic 8 propagation or bkg fill).
 * Background not detected/filled (should be 3? based on fallback or uniform rows like row 5/0, but 5's remain everywhere); no seeds placed (clue_row=g[1] has 1 at col1, 3 at10,2 at13,4 at19—should trigger upper pairs at ~cols 2-3 (for1?), 8-9/14-15/20-21? but none appear).
 * Propagation absent (e.g., no 8's extended in potential prop rows; row 13 has isolated 8's but no left/right fill; lower rows like 19-21 have 9's but no right-fill from seeds if first_clue=1).
 * Output seems like a partial copy of input g[6:25] with minimal changes (only some 5→bkg? but many 5's persist; 0's unchanged, which may be invalid—puzzle likely requires full resolution to colors/8/bkg); does not match expected logic (e.g., should place 8 pairs in upper rows based on clues, prop in rows with original 8's like row 13?, fill bkg=3 in empties, preserve 2/9/1/4 blocks).
 * Likely issues: len(g)!=25 check failed or early return; clue parsing missed (0's in groups may skip activation); no has_prop rows detected (input has no original 8's?); upper_block_start not found properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 25x24 grid where the goal is to generate a modified 19-row output (rows 6-24 of the input) by detecting a background color, interpreting clues in row 1 to place pairs of "8" elements (representing seeds or props), and applying propagations to fill ranges of 8's based on rules for upper and lower blocks, while replacing 5's with background and handling special cases like right-fills and has-prop rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bkg) is determined by the most common non-0,5,8 value in rows 6+, defaulting to 3 if none; 5's are always replaced by bkg across the output.
 * Clues in row 1 are grouped in 4-cell blocks starting at columns 1,7,13,19; each group has a key color (first non-0/5 value) at a position (0-3) that dictates pair placement for 8's: e.g., position 0 with color 4/6 or (lower and 1) activates left-leaning pairs; position 3 with 2/4/6 activates right-leaning pairs; color 3 skips activation.
 * Upper pairs (for rows 0- max_prop_i in output indexing) are computed from all 4 groups (is_lower=False); lower pairs (for rows max_prop_i+1 to 18) use first group info and original 8-range if present.
 * Propagations: "has_prop" rows (any original 8) fill 8's across min-max 8 columns; right-fill propagates 8's from a start column to end in specific upper/lower blocks; upper block is initial all-bkg rows (up to 2 for right prop); lower prop starts at row 13/14 with 2 rows of fill/propagation based on first color (1/4 triggers pair, 1/2 triggers right-fill, else has-prop).
 * Subtleties: Pair starts/ends vary by color/position (e.g., color 1 pos0 -> start+3; color 2 pos3 -> start+3 but special for last group; color 4 pos0 checks next group's color for +3 vs +1); original 8-range is min-max columns with 8 in rows 6-24; max_prop_i is highest has_prop row index; rightmost upper pair determines if +1 offset for right_fill_start; lower left_fill_start from first pair or original min.
 * Easy to miss: First group handles color 1 specially for lower; lower prop num=2 but clipped to 19; pairs only placed if activated and color !=3; output copies input rows 6-24 then modifies; invalid input returns empty list.
 * Across attempts: No full successes; common issues include over-placing 8's in non-prop areas, missing full range fills (e.g., not expanding to connect 8's properly), incorrect pair positions based on clue logic, and failing to handle block transitions (upper to lower) or special fills (right/left).

(Extracts key color per group; helpful for pair logic, especially cross-group checks like color 4 pos0.)

    return min_col, max_col if max_col >= 0 else (0, -1)
```
(Finds global min-max 8 columns for lower pairs/propagations; essential for cases with pre-existing 8's.)

```python

        if any(cell == 8 for cell in row):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Identifies rows needing has-prop fill; useful but needs integration with max_prop_i for block split.)

```python
def propagate_has_prop(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    eight_cols = [j for j, cell in enumerate(new_row) if cell == 8]

        return new_row
    min_j = min(eight_cols)
    max_j = max(eight_cols)
    for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
        if new_row[j] == bkg:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```
(Fills gaps between min-max 8's in a row; core for has-prop, but unhelpful if applied too broadly without 8's present.)

```python
def is_all_bkg_row(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> bool:
    return all(cell == bkg for cell in row)
```
(Detects pure bkg rows for upper block end; helpful for limiting initial placements.)

The `compute_seed_pairs` and `get_first_group_info` functions are partially helpful for pair extraction but buggy (e.g., incomplete activation logic, special cases like gi=3 for color 2 mishandled); `place_seeds` is straightforward but overused without checks. Overall program structure (copy output, replace 5's, place then propagate) is a good skeleton but fails on block transitions and specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, bkg detection, and pair placement but fails all training examples due to incorrect propagations and pair positions.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8's in rows 7-8 (full middle fill too early) and row 9 (8's at 4-5 instead of connecting properly); missed full connection in row 7-8 (expected 0-3 as 1's unchanged, but placed 8's wrongly); lower rows 14-16 overfilled with 8's instead of partial; rows 16-18 correct for 2's but upper mismatches blob shapes (unknown why, possibly wrong upper_pairs or prop range).
 * Train 2: Generated wrong 8-range in row 2 (8's at 14-17 instead of 14-23 full); missed full 8-propagation in rows 2-3 (expected 8's to 23); row 5 has extra 8's at 16-17 where expected 1's; row 14 has 8's at 8-15 instead of none; row 15 partial 8's missing; lower rows 16-18 correct but upper prop fails to connect properly (e.g., row 8-9 should connect more).
 * Train 3: Generated wrong initial 8's in row 0-2 (3's at 8-17 instead of 8's? Wait, expected has 8's at 18-19 but generated 3's there initially?); rows 4-6 have 8's at 8-17 but expected full 0-4 8's in row 4; row 12 has 8's at 5-13 but expected none/more specific; row 13 overfills 8's at 5-13; row 14 partial but misses full 14-23 8's; lower row 16-18 has 7's at 3-4 instead of none, and 4's start too early without full prop.
 * Common misses: Over-placement of 8's in non-activated areas; incorrect block split (max_prop_i too low/high, leading to wrong upper/lower pairs); right-fill applied wrongly (e.g., starts too early or not at all); lower prop start/num hardcoded poorly (14 for 1/4 but affects fills); original 8-range not always used for lower pairs; has_prop applied universally instead of selectively.
 * Function `propagate_lower_prop_right_fill` is helpful for right-fills but unhelpful when misapplied (e.g., fills from wrong start, overfills empty rows).
 * Function `get_first_group_info` is broken for some colors (e.g., doesn't handle pos0 color=4/6 fully, leading to wrong lower pairs in Train 1/2).
 * Overall, attempt shows core structure but lacks precise clue-to-pair mapping and prop conditions; unhelpful to reuse raw `program` without fixes to activation and block logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an ERROR (invalid grid format: returned <class 'list'> instead of proper 19x24 List[List[int]]), indicating a crash likely from unhandled input dimensions, empty pairs, or index errors in propagation (e.g., pair_end >23 or max_prop_i invalid).
 * No generated grid to evaluate, but based on training failures, it would likely mismatch by over/under-placing 8's, wrong bkg replacement, or failed propagations (e.g., missing connections in has-prop rows or incorrect lower fills); does not look correct as it didn't produce output at all—must fix input validation and edge cases like no 8's or unusual clue colors to handle test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a 25-row by 24-column grid where rows 6-24 represent a drawable area with a background color, existing "8" elements (likely props or paint to propagate), and clues in upper rows (e.g., row 1) that dictate pair placements and fills of "8"s in upper (top ~half) and lower (bottom ~half) sections. The goal is to propagate and fill "8"s based on clue-derived rules for pairs, gaps, special connections, and background replacement, while preserving non-background elements like colored blocks (1-7,9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection: Scan rows 6-24, count non-0/5/8 cells, pick most common as background (default 3); replace all 5's with it. Subtle: Ignores 0/5/8 to avoid miscounting empties/props/specials, but may fail if background is rare or tied to clues.
 * Clue row parsing: Clues in row 1, divided into 4 groups of 4 cells (starts at indices 1,7,13,19). Each group has a "color" (non-0/5 value) and "position" (0-3 offset where color appears). Color=0 or 3 skips group; others trigger pair starts based on color/pos combos (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may depend on next group's color). Subtle: Last group (start 19) has edge case for pos=3/color=2 shifting to 18; pairs are always 2-wide (start to start+1), but computation varies (e.g., color 6 at pos 0 -> start+1; color 4 at pos 3 -> start+2).
 * Upper vs. lower sections: Upper is rows 0 to max_prop_i (index of last row with original 8's); lower is after. Place pairs as 8's only if the slot is all-background. Subtle: Upper uses multiple pairs from all groups; lower uses single pair from first group (with extra color=1 case at pos=0 -> start+3) or original 8-range if no special lower condition.
 * Original 8's range: Find min/max col with 8's in rows 6-24; used for lower fills if not special. Subtle: If no 8's, defaults to (24,-1) which skips.
 * Has_prop rows: Rows (0-18 relative) with any original 8; after placing pairs/seeds, fill gaps between min/max 8 in that row with 8's (connect blobs horizontally).
 * Special lower fills: For rows 14-15 (absolute 20-21?) if first group color in {1,2,4}, connect existing 8's to a target range (e.g., color=1 -> to col 23; color=2 -> from min_col to 23; color=4 -> from leftmost 8 to min_col). Subtle: Only if min_col <24 and 8's exist; applied after seeds but before/in gap fill? Order matters for connections.
 * Right fill upper: If upper pairs exist, find rightmost pair start; if it matches a computed group position and is at group_start+1, fill from that col to 24 with 8's—but only in the FIRST all-background row up to max_prop_i. Subtle: Only activates for specific cases (e.g., gi !=-1 and exact pos); seems to target a "spillover" but only once, which may miss multi-row propagation.
 * Propagation order: Replace 5's first -> compute pairs/ranges -> place seeds in upper/lower -> gap fill in has_prop rows -> special lower fills. Subtle: Gap fill only in has_prop (not all rows), and special lower overrides/reconnects based on color; no vertical propagation, only horizontal connects/fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty pairs/ranges skip; indices 0-23 cols; output is rows 6-24 modified. Subtle: Lower special skips if color not in [1,2,4]; background may be non-3 (e.g., 1 or 7 in examples); clues may have 0/5 as fillers.
 * General: Preserve non-bkg/non-8 (e.g., 1-4,6,7,9 blocks); no overwriting existing 8's; fills only on bkg slots.

            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Helpful: Finds global 8-range for lower seeds; identifies rows needing gap fills. Essential for sectioning upper/lower and connecting.)

```python
def get_first_color(clue_row: List[int]) -> int:
    return get_group_info(clue_row, 1)[0]
```
(Helpful: Quick first-group color for special lower trigger.)

The pair computation functions (compute_upper_pairs, compute_lower_pair) are partially helpful for deriving 2-wide starts from clues but buggy (see below; overcomplicated logic misses cases). apply_right_fill_upper is unhelpful/broken (only fills one row, specific pos, doesn't propagate). Gap fill logic in main loop is helpful but limited to has_prop rows only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/only attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, background, and horizontal fills but fails all trainings due to incomplete propagation.
 * Train 1: Generated correctly places some upper pairs (e.g., 8,8 at cols 8-9 and 16-17 in early rows) and lower 2's/4's, detects bkg=3, but misses full connections in has_prop rows (e.g., row 7: generated has 8's only at 4-5? Wait, actually generated row7 [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,3,3] but expected starts 8's at col0; diff: generated delays left-fill until row8, and row11 has extra 3's vs expected 8's? Unknown why partial gap fill). Also, row12 generated has 8's at 0-1 but expected none there; special lower not triggering full right-fill in rows 14-16. Right fill didn't activate.
 * Train 2: Generated places upper pairs correctly in some rows (e.g., 8,8 at 4-5,8-9), bkg=1, but misses extending 8's in lower non-special rows (e.g., row3: generated 8's only partial vs expected full 13-23; row14: generated no 8's vs expected full connect). Lower pair computation wrong (places at wrong pos for color=6?). Special lower (rows16-18 with 4's) correct but upstream misses prevent full blobs. Gap fill skips non-has_prop or doesn't connect to min_col properly.
 * Train 3: Generated bkg=7 correctly, places some 8's (e.g., 3-4,18-19 pairs), but misses vertical consistency and full upper connects (e.g., row4: generated 8's at 8-9 but expected full 0-23 except edges; row5-6 similar partial). Has_prop gap fill incomplete (e.g., row11: generated connects some but leaves gaps at 8-17 vs expected full). Lower special not handled (rows16-18: generated 4's start at col8 but expected from col3; unknown pos miscalc). Right fill absent. Edge: row14 generated partial 8's vs expected more connects.
 * Overall: Pair logic over-relies on pos/color combos, missing spillover (e.g., color4 depending on next group often wrong). Gap fill only horizontal/per-row, no multi-row or full-section flood. Special lower misfires (wrong leftmost/to_col for colors). apply_right_fill_upper unhelpful (too narrow, only one row, didn't trigger in any train). No vertical propagation, leading to fragmented 8's. compute_lower_pair adds color=1 case but buggy (pos=0/1 overlap?). Program preserves colors well but under-fills 8's systematically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it seems to mishandle background (fills early rows 0-2 with 2's, but if bkg=3 at end, why 2's? Possible clue color leak or wrong bkg detect—clues may have 2's dominating count). Upper pairs/seeds partial (e.g., row7 has 8's at 8-10 but fragmented with 9's; expected smoother connects based on trains). Has_prop gap fill inconsistent (e.g., row13: 8's scattered with 9's gaps vs expected solid blobs). Lower special likely wrong (rows17-18: 4's at 7-15 but 8's/9's around; if first_color=4, should connect to min_col=3? but mixes with 9's). Ends with 9's, suggesting bkg=9 or un-replaced, but trains show preservation—output has too many isolated 8's and no full right-fills. Doesn't match train patterns (e.g., no solid lower 8-range); likely misses clue-dependent pairs and over-relies on original 8's which may be sparse. Unknown test clues/grid, but fragmented 8's/9's suggest broken pair computation or gap fill not extending to edges.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to generate a 19x24 output grid (rows 6-24 of the input) representing a support structure filled with 8s (beams or props) on a background color, based on clues in row 1 that dictate group-based pair placements, anchors from original 8s, propagation of fills, and special conditional rules for upper/lower sections, while replacing temporary 5s with background and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid is 25 rows by 24 columns; output must be exactly rows 6-24 (19 rows x 24 cols), with all non-8 cells set to the detected background color (most common non-0/5/8 value in output rows, defaulting to 3 if none).
 * Clue row (g[1]) is divided into 4 groups starting at columns 1,7,13,19 (each 4 cols wide); each group has a "color" (1-7, non-0/5) and "pos" (0-3 offset where color appears), which triggers specific pair placements (cols for 8-pairs) in upper (top half) or lower (bottom half) sections, with activations only for certain color-pos combos (e.g., color 1 pos 0 triggers lower pairs and left support at col 4-5; color 2/4/6 at pos 0 or 3 trigger upper pairs with offsets like +1, +3).
 * Anchor range is the min-max columns of original 8s in input rows 6-24; these must be filled with 8s across all output rows if background, but only in "has_prop" rows (those originally containing any 8).
 * Upper pairs apply to rows <= max_has_prop (upper block), lower pairs to rows > max_has_prop (lower block); special left support pairs (col 4-5) apply only to upper has_prop rows if color 1 pos 0.
 * Propagation: In has_prop rows, fill all background cells between min and max 8 positions with 8s (gap filling).
 * Special fills: If color 1 pos 0, fill cols 4+ to end with 8s in specific lower rows (14-15, 0-indexed in output); for upper right fill, if rightmost upper pair starts at group_start+1, fill cols from that start to end in the first 2 all-background upper rows.
 * Subtleties: Pairs only place if both cells are background (no overwrite); color 4 at pos 0 may skip next group if followed by color 2; background detection ignores 0/5/8; 5s are placeholders to replace with background before placing; has_prop rows are only those with original 8s, and max_prop_i is their max index (splits upper/lower); for last group (start 19), pos 3 color 2 adjusts pair_start to 18; empty groups (all 0/5) or color 3 skip pairs; propagation is per-row and only in has_prop rows; upper right fill requires detecting "plus1" starts and finding initial all-background block (may be 0-2 rows).
 * Edge cases: No original 8s means no anchors/propagation/max_prop_i=-1 (all upper pairs, no lower/left support); test input may have different dimensions or empty clues, causing format errors; overwrites must be avoided, but fills can expand existing 8s; lower right fill is narrow (only rows 14-15, cols 4+); upper block for right fill is prefix of all-background rows.

**Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `compute_lower_pairs`: Too simplistic; only handles color 1 pos 0 with fixed pair at 1+3=4, but misses broader lower rules (e.g., no pairs for other colors, and doesn't integrate with has_prop split properly; generated outputs show missing lower 8s in Train 2 rows 2-4, where expected has 8s at 13-23).
- `apply_lower_right_fill`: Hardcoded to rows 14-15 (output indices 8-9?) and cols 4+, but only if color 1 pos 0; broken for general cases, as Train 1 generated no such fill but expected subtle right 3s (not 8s); causes overfill or miss.
- `apply_upper_right_fill`: Complex but buggy; detects "plus1" but fills only first 2 all-bkg upper rows from rightmost pair start; in Train 1, it overfills right cols 22-23 with 8s in early rows (generated has 8,8 vs expected 3,3), and in Train 3, it doesn't trigger correctly, missing full right expansions.
- `place_seeds`: Attempts conditional placement but ignores full grid state; places anchors everywhere (even non-has_prop), causing overfill in lower blocks (e.g., Train 1 rows 16-18 have extra 8s in cols 4-15 where expected 2s/3s); also places pairs without checking has_prop boundaries properly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of clue parsing (groups, colors, pos) and background/anchor basics, but fails on conditional placements, propagation limits, and special fills, leading to all trainings incorrect.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8-pairs at cols 22-23 in rows 0-2,6-12 (vs expected 3,3 there, indicating overactive upper right fill or anchor expansion); rows 4-6 have 8,8 at 22-23 vs expected 3,3 or 4,4/3,3; rows 9-10 have 3,3 at 22-23 vs expected 3,3 (match) but earlier mismatches like row 8 has 4,4/3,3 vs 4,4/3,3 (partial match); row 12 has 3,3 at end vs 3,3 (match); lower rows 14-15 overfill cols 4-23 with 8s vs expected 8s only in anchor range; rows 16-18 have 2s starting at col 4 but expected same (match, but propagation missed gaps). Propagation works partially but applies anchors too broadly.
 * Train 2: Generated missing wide 8-fill in rows 2-4 cols 13-23 (has 1,1/1,1/1,1 vs expected 8s across, indicating failed lower pair or right fill trigger for color 6); row 14 has 8s cols 8-15 vs expected 8s cols 8-23 (underfill right); row 15 overfills cols 0-7 with 1s? Wait, generated 1s but expected 8s cols 0-23 partial; lower rows 16-18 match 4s but no 8-propagation into them. Upper pairs placed correctly for cols 4-5/8-9 but missed color 6 specifics (pair at 13?).
 * Train 3: Generated partial anchor fills but missed full expansions, e.g., rows 4-6 have 8s at 8-9/18-19 but expected wider 8s cols 0-7/16-19 in some; rows 11-12 have 8s cols 3-23 but expected 8s cols 3-19/6+; row 13 has 7s cols 0-2/20-23 vs expected 8s expansions; row 14 underfills cols 0-2/20-23; lower rows 16-18 have 4s cols 8-21 but expected 4s cols 8-21 with 7s edges (match but no prop). Color 2/6 triggers partial pairs but propagation doesn't connect to anchors fully; left groups (cols 0-3) have mismatched 7/2 vs expected 8 expansions.
 * Common issues: Over-placement of anchors/pairs outside has_prop (e.g., full grid anchors in Train 1 lower); incorrect upper/lower split (max_prop_i not limiting lower pairs properly, causing Train 2 underfill); special fills trigger wrongly (extra right 8s in Train 1, missing in Train 3); replace_fives works (no 5s remain) but background=3 assumed correctly; compute_upper_pairs misses skips (e.g., Train 1 color 4 pos? followed by 2?); no handling for empty has_prop (max_prop_i=-1 leads to all-upper, but Train 2 expects lower 8s).
 * get_group_info and find_background are solid (clues parsed right, bkg=3/1/7 matches inputs); place_pair is helpful but too permissive (no full conflict check beyond bkg).

**Test output:**
 * No valid generated output (ERROR: returned <class 'list'> instead of List[List[int]]); likely a bug in program() return (e.g., slicing g[6:25] fails if input !=25 rows, or empty output [] if dimensions wrong); this suggests the program assumes fixed 25x24 but test input may vary (e.g., smaller grid or non-list), causing crash—does not make sense as output, as it can't be verified; expected output unknown without rules run, but mentally: if test has unique clues (e.g., color 3 skips, or no 8s), output should be mostly bkg with minimal pairs/anchors; to fix, add dimension checks and return empty/fixed grid on error, but current crash indicates poor robustness for test case.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top rows (likely 0-5) represent an "above-ground" or sky area filled with background, and the content from lower rows (6+) is shifted up into a new grid. The number 8 represents a filling substance (e.g., "sand" or "growth") that originates from seed positions in the shifted content and expands vertically upward and horizontally sideways into background areas, but only in connected regions without crossing barriers (possibly number 5 acts as a barrier since it's skipped in copying). The goal is to produce a filled grid matching the expected patterns, where 8's propagate in a way that forms connected blobs, often widening horizontally at certain levels and filling "pockets" above the seeds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a fixed structure: 25 rows x 24 columns (based on output lengths), with background determined from g[6][0], suggesting row 6 is a reference for ground level or initial background.
 * Shifting: Content from rows 6+ of input g is copied to rows 0+ of output, but only non-5 values are preserved; 5's are treated as erasable or barriers (replaced with background), and top 6 rows of output are pure background— this works partially but leads to incomplete fills if expansion doesn't account for post-shift connections.
 * Seeds for 8's: Identified as positions with 8 in rows 6+ of input (shifted to 0+), collecting unique columns and the lowest (max row index) seed row; this identifies starting points but misses that expansion should connect across multiple seeds horizontally if they are at similar levels or via background.
 * Vertical expansion: Fills upward (from max_row +1 to top) only in exact seed columns if background—this is too narrow; expected outputs show 8's filling entire connected horizontal spans (e.g., widening to multiple columns) and propagating up through adjacent background cells, not just vertically in seeds.
 * Sideways expansion: Only at the specific lower_row (max seed row shifted), expanding left/right from min/max seed columns until non-background—this is limited to one row and doesn't propagate upward or connect blobs; expected shows horizontal fills at multiple rows (e.g., full-width 8's in some levels) and diagonal-ish connections.
 * Barriers and non-fills: 8's do not overwrite existing non-background numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 stay intact); only background is filled. Number 5 is skipped in initial copy, acting like a temporary barrier or void. Expansions stop at edges or other numbers. Subtle: Fills can "bridge" across background at various heights if connected to seeds via paths (e.g., in training 1, 8's extend right to col 16-17 in top rows, suggesting horizontal connectivity above seeds).
 * Connectivity: Likely requires flood-fill-like behavior (BFS/DFS from seeds upward and sideways through background only), not just linear expands— this is a key miss, as current code treats seeds independently without merging blobs. Also, fills may not go infinitely up (stops at top or barriers), and some expected patterns show 8's "hanging" or widening mid-grid.
 * Other elements: Existing shapes (e.g., 1's, 2's, 4's) remain but may get 8's filled around/above them; bottom rows in some examples have unchanged patterns (e.g., 2's in training 1). Grids may have multiple disconnected 8 blobs that need independent expansion. Easy to miss: Expansions can happen in "pockets" above barriers, and seeds might not be in every column, requiring horizontal spread before vertical.
 * All training examples failed due to under-filling: 8's didn't spread wide enough horizontally or connect across rows/columns as in expected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current functions provide a basic framework for shifting and seed detection but need enhancement for proper expansion (e.g., integrate flood fill).

```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[6][0]  # Helpful: Correctly identifies background from a fixed reference point.
```

```python
def shift_and_fill(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    out = [[background for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
    for i in range(18):  # Assumes h=24, shifts 18 rows (6+ to 24)
        for j in range(w):
            val = g[i + 6][j]
            if val != 5:
                out[i][j] = val
    return out  # Helpful: Basic shifting and 5-skipping works (preserves shapes), but top 6 rows are correctly background-filled; issue is post-shift expansion.
```

```python
def find_seed_columns_and_max_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    seed_cols = set()
    max_row = -1
    for i in range(6, h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] == 8:
                seed_cols.add(j)
                if i > max_row:
                    max_row = i
    return list(seed_cols), max_row - 6 if max_row >= 6 else -1  # Helpful: Accurately finds 8 seeds in lower input rows and computes shifted max row; useful for starting flood fill from these points.
```

The expansion functions (expand_vertical, expand_sideways) are broken/not helpful: They perform linear fills only in seed columns or at one row, missing connected region filling—do not reuse without major changes (e.g., replace with flood fill from all seeds).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single summarized attempt (the provided program); it partially understands shifting and seed detection but fails on expansion logic across all training examples.
 * Worked: Background detection is correct (matches all examples). Shifting copies non-5 content accurately (e.g., preserves 1's, 2's, 4's shapes in all trainings). Seed column collection identifies starting 8 positions correctly (e.g., cols 8-9 in training 1).
 * Didn't work: Vertical expansion too narrow (only seed cols, no horizontal connectivity upward), leading to thin 8 columns instead of wide blobs (e.g., training 1 generated 8's only in cols 8-9 top-to-mid, but expected has cols 4-5 + 8-9 + extensions to 16-17; training 2 misses cols 4-5 and wide row 2-3; training 3 misses left/right spreads from col 3-4 to wider 8's).
 * Sideways expansion limited to one row (lower_row), no propagation (e.g., training 1 generated no right extension to col 16-17 in top rows; expected connects horizontally at multiple levels. Training 2 generated no 8's in cols 4-5 or wide row 2; expected has them. Training 3 generated 8's only in cols 12-13 mid-grid, but expected has full rows 4-5 as 8's from col 0-11+).
 * Overall under-filling of 8's: Generated outputs have fewer/sparser 8's than expected (e.g., training 1: generated row 8 has 8's only cols 8-9 + some lower, expected has cols 4-17; row 12 generated no 8's in col 4-5, expected has them. Training 2: generated row 2 has 8's only cols 8-9, expected cols 4-5+8-9+14-21. Training 3: generated row 4 has 7's where expected has 8's in cols 0-3+12. Differences are consistent: lack of blob merging and upward horizontal spread).
 * No handling of multi-level connectivity or flood fill, causing isolated 8's (e.g., unknown why training 1 row 9-10 have 8's only in cols 4-5? Wait, generated has 3's there, expected 8's—likely missed vertical from adjacent seeds).
 * Function expand_vertical is unhelpful/broken: Linear per-column fill ignores horizontal neighbors (don't reuse).
 * Function expand_sideways is unhelpful/broken: Single-row expansion doesn't propagate (don't reuse).
 * find_seed_columns_and_max_row is essential/helpful: Reuse for seed detection, but expand from all seeds simultaneously via flood fill.
 * shift_and_fill is essential/helpful: Core shifting works, but ensure post-shift grid allows connected fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and shows misunderstanding of expansion rules. It has 8's only in cols 8-10 for top 3 rows (narrow, like failed vertical expand), then mostly 9's in mid-grid with isolated 8's in row 7 cols 8-10, and bottom rows with 2's and a partial 4's row (row 17 has 4's in cols 7-16, but shifted oddly). This mismatches likely expectations: Based on patterns, test input probably has seeds in lower parts (e.g., around cols 8+), requiring wide 8 fills upward into background pockets around 9's and 1's, connecting horizontally (e.g., full-width 8's mid-grid like training 3, or extensions around 9's blob). Instead, generated under-fills 8's (no wide spreads), leaves excessive 9's unfilled, and doesn't connect bottom 2's area—looks like incomplete shifting/expansion, similar to training failures (e.g., no bridging over 9's). Make sure to account for flood-filling connected background regions from all seeds upward/sideways to handle test case's probable large 9's structure and bottom 2's/4's.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 representing colors) where the top 6 rows appear to be a header or metadata, and the task is to extract and shift down the content below it, identify rectangular "panels" or blocks of uniform color (excluding background, 0, 5, 8), detect a special "maroon" (8) connector block, and then augment the layout by filling gaps and extending 8-colored borders to connect panels horizontally and vertically in a structured way, likely simulating comic panel borders or a unified strip.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background color (bg) is determined by the most common non-0/5/8 color in rows below y=6; this works but can miss if ties or edge cases occur.
 * Content blocks are only rectangles of uniform color c (1-9, excluding bg/0/5/8) larger than 4 cells, starting from the topmost row with that color; non-rectangular or small blobs are ignored, which is key but fails if blocks aren't perfectly rectangular or if detection misses partial overlaps.
 * Maroon (8) block detection expands from the first found 8 cell to its full rectangle; it's treated specially as a connector, but the code assumes only one and starts search from y=6, potentially missing if multiple or positioned oddly.
 * Output grid is the input height minus 6 rows, initialized to bg, with content blocks placed shifted up by 6 rows; this cropping and shifting is core but can clip blocks if they extend into the top 6.
 * Connections with 8: Horizontal fills in "connection rows" (where maroon overlaps after shift) between content edges and maroon; full vertical middle bar through maroon x-range; conditional left lower bar extension if content below on left; right upper bar if content above on right; bottom horizontal fill near lowest blocks, with height based on gap size (1 or 2 rows) and x-range adjusted by reach; upper right gap fills between stacked right-side blocks, limited by their heights and connection row.
 * Subtleties: 5 might be a special non-content/non-bg color (ignored in counts/blocks); connections only fill bg cells (not overwriting content); horizontal fills in connection rows set uniform x-start/end but code computes per row, leading to inconsistencies; bottom fill x-start uses left_bar if extended, else maroon start, and x-end checks if lowest blocks reach right; upper right fills only for blocks entirely right of maroon and above connection, filling from right_bar to edge but only in gaps; no overwriting of existing non-bg; assumes w is constant; potential issues with y_min=6 exactly or maroon not overlapping content vertically after shift.
 * Edge cases: No maroon (returns empty, no connections); no blocks (empty output); maroon above y=6 (clips); overlapping blocks (detection takes first topmost); small gaps (h=1 vs 2 for bottom); right-side stacks with varying heights; left/right extensions only if content "touches" bar x-range; all fills are 8-only, no other colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of connection rules.
 * Train 1: Generated correctly shifted and placed blocks (1's left, 4's right, 2's bottom), detected bg=3 and maroon at x=8-9, but missed extending 8's rightward in upper connection rows (expected 8's at x=16-17 in rows 0-6); lower left 1's connected partially but no bottom horizontal 8's under gap; rows 9-11 have 8's only in maroon without left extension to x=4; rows 12-14 missing left 8's entirely; bottom 2's placed but no connection.
 * Train 2: Generated placed blocks (2's left, 3's right, 4's bottom, 6's mid-right) and maroon at x=8-9, bg=1, but missed left 8 extensions in rows 0-4 (expected at x=0-1); row 2 has extra 8's in right but overwrote or misfilled; connection rows (likely 5-9) have partial horizontals but no full upper right 8 bar in rows 14-15; bottom 4's isolated without connection.
 * Train 3: Generated bg=7, blocks (2's left, 3's top, 4's bottom, 6's right), maroon at x=12-13, but missed left 8 extensions in early rows (expected at x=0-1 in rows 0-3); row 4 has full 8's but overwrote 3's incorrectly; middle bar partial; lower extensions missing in rows 13-16 (expected more 8's under 7's); bottom 4's connected but x-range wrong (starts too left); upper fills incomplete.
 * Block detection generally works for rectangles but may miss if not starting exactly at topmost full row or if >4 size threshold excludes small panels.
 * Maroon detection finds block but expansion assumes horizontal then vertical, which fails if irregular shape.
 * Connection logic attempts horizontals per row but sets uniform h_start/h_end incorrectly (uses first row's, ignores variations); left/right bar conditions check overlap but use wrong y-ranges post-shift; bottom horizontal gap calc uses min_y but h=1/2 based on >4 arbitrary; upper right gap fill sorts blocks but fills only to w, may overfill or underfill heights.
 * place_content_blocks clips y but doesn't handle x clipping; create_output_grid initializes correctly.
 * Overall, core shifting and block placement works in parts, but connection fills are inconsistent (e.g., no rightward extensions in train 1/2, missing vertical bars in train 3); function find_maroon_block is helpful but returns empty on no 8, skipping connections; get_background_color ignores 8 correctly but may pick wrong if sparse.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on training patterns; it shifts content down by 6 (top 3 rows of 2's become rows 0-2, bottom 4's to rows 17-19, 9's and 1's placed), detects bg likely as 3 or 9? but fills much of the grid with 9's incorrectly (e.g., rows 3-6,9-16 mostly 9's where expected might be isolated blocks), maroon at x=8-9 extended vertically but horizontals overfill (e.g., row 7 full 8's from x=3-20, but training suggests only targeted fills); right side has 8's at x=19-20 in some rows but inconsistent with expected connections; bottom rows 17-19 have 4's but surrounded by 9's instead of connected 8's; upper right (rows 20-23) all 9's with 8's, likely misbg or overfill; lacks targeted gap fills (e.g., no bottom horizontal under 1's/9's to 4's); overall too much 9-overwrite and missing precise 8-bars, doesn't match structured connections from training expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming a 24x24 grid by detecting a background color, creating a large structural "maroon" (color 8) overlay in the upper portion, shifting non-background shapes upward from the lower part of the original grid into this structure (with some exclusions and adjustments to avoid overlaps), filling remaining spaces with the background color, and applying targeted overrides to certain areas like the top rows. The goal is to produce a new grid that integrates shifted elements into a patterned maroon frame-like structure while preserving specific visual motifs from the original.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The maroon (8) structure is not a solid full-row block from rows 0-15; instead, it's a patterned frame or segmented bars (e.g., pairs of 8s separated by background color in specific columns, like cols 8-9 and 16-17 in train1, or more complex interruptions in train3), which gets partially overridden by shifted shapes but retains key segments to form a consistent "end" or boundary motif across examples.
 * Shapes to shift are non-background and non-zero, but the exclusion of color 8 (maroon) and 5 (possibly a special marker or small element) in the current program prevents placing original maroon elements or certain accents, leading to missing 8s in expected positions; subtle rule may be to shift all non-background except perhaps only exclude 0 and true background, or handle 5/8 differently per shape.
 * Shifting is mostly upward by 6 rows from original rows 6+, but with a variable shift (5 for rows >=21) to handle bottom elements without overlap; however, this doesn't account for per-shape alignment or column-specific placements, causing misalignment (e.g., in train1, shifted 1s and 4s don't align with expected positions around the maroon bars).
 * Background detection samples from rows 6-23 and non-zero cells in col 24? (code has range(24), but intent may be edge sampling); this works for uniform bgs like 3 or 1 but may fail if bg varies or has patterns.
 * Top rows (0-2) need override of maroon back to bg only in areas not intended for structure, but current full-row override erases too much (e.g., in train1 expected, top 8s remain in specific cols); subtle: overrides should be selective, perhaps only where no shifted shape or structure is present, or propagate bg only in empty top areas.
 * Bottom rows (16+) seem to receive shifted elements correctly in some cases (e.g., the 2-bar in train1 rows 16-17 matches), but in others like train2, shifted 4s and 1s are misplaced or overfilled with bg.
 * Original grid has "small ones" or accents (e.g., color 5?) that may need special handling, like omission or separate shifting, as noted in code comments but not implemented effectively.
 * Overall, the transformation creates a "scroll" or "panel" effect: upper half gets a maroon frame with inserted shifted shapes, lower half gets remaining shifted elements on bg, but must match exact patterns without overfilling 8s or misaligning shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Maroon structures vary slightly per example (e.g., full-width in lower parts of train1 row14-15, but interrupted in train3), suggesting detection or hardcoding of frame based on bg or global rules; also, some expected 8s appear in shifted positions, implying original 8s should sometimes be shifted too.
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes a fixed large maroon block, which ignores per-example frame patterns; shifting excludes too much, leading to loss of structural 8s; fill_background after shifting is good but happens too late/early in sequence for overrides.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Samples non-zero pixels from lower-right area (rows 6-23, cols 0-23 effectively) to find dominant bg color; helpful for uniform bgs but may need expansion to full grid or edge detection for patterned bgs.
    pixels = [g[r][c] for r in range(6, 24) for c in range(24) if g[r][c] != 0]
    if not pixels:
        return 0
    return Counter(pixels).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def fill_background(new_g: List[List[int]], bg_color: int):
    # Fills all 0s with bg after placing structures/shifts; this is useful and correctly sequenced in the program, as it cleans up empties without overwriting placed elements.
    for r in range(24):
        for c in range(24):
            if new_g[r][c] == 0:
                new_g[r][c] = bg_color
```

```python
def place_top_override(new_g: List[List[int]], bg_color: int):
    # Overrides 8s to bg in top 3 rows; partially helpful for bg propagation but too broad—should be conditional on positions without structure or shifts to preserve expected 8 bars.
    for r in range(3):
        for c in range(24):
            if new_g[r][c] == 8:
                new_g[r][c] = bg_color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg color (e.g., 3 in train1, 1 in train2, 7 in train3) and partially shifts bottom shapes upward (e.g., the 2-bar in train1 rows16-17 and 4-bar in train2 rows17-18 land in reasonable positions without overlap).
 * Shifting logic works for avoiding bottom overlaps (variable shift 5/6) and excluding 0/bg, but fails by excluding all 5 and 8, causing loss of accent elements and failure to place original maroons into the structure (e.g., in train3, expected has shifted 8s in mid-grid, but generated has solid 8 blocks instead).
 * Large maroon placement as full rows 0-15 is incorrect—generates solid 8 blocks that get partially overridden, but expected has sparse, paired 8s (e.g., train1 top: 8s only in cols8-9/16-17 amid bg 3s; train2: similar pairs with 8s in shifted areas like row2 cols13-20).
 * Top override erases too many 8s, leading to full bg rows 0-2 in generated (vs. expected patterned 8s in train1/2/3 tops).
 * In train1: Generated has solid 8s in rows3-15 with left 1s overriding incorrectly (full left 4 cols as 1s in rows3-11, but expected has 1s only in row3 left, then 3s interrupting 8s); bottom 2s in rows17-18 match expected positions but row16 is wrong (full 3s vs. expected empty-ish).
 * In train2: Generated shifts 2s and 3s into solid 8s but misaligns (e.g., row5 2s start at col0 over 8s, but expected has them starting col0 with 8 interruptions); top rows have misplaced 1s/6s without patterns (row0-1 full 1s left/mid 6s, but expected has 8 pairs); bottom 4s in rows17-18 match but surrounded by wrong 1s.
 * In train3: Generated has solid 8s overriding everything, with 2s shifting to row7+ but not aligning (e.g., row7 2s at col0-2 over 8s, expected has them at col0-2 with 8s starting col3); top 7s/3s in row0-2 match bg but miss 8 pairs; bottom 4s in rows17-18 match positions but row16 has wrong 2s/7s.
 * place_shifted_shapes is mostly helpful for bulk shifting but broken for exclusions (skips 8/5, causing missing elements) and doesn't handle per-column or shape-specific adjustments.
 * place_large_maroon is unhelpful/broken: assumes uniform full-width 8s, but puzzle needs patterned 8 frames (e.g., detect or hardcode bar positions based on bg); don't use this as-is in future.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of shift+bg+override sequence but misses core patterned maroon rule, leading to all INCORRECT; no object extraction function present, which might help identify shapes for precise placement (e.g., detect bars and their cols).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it has full bg 2 rows 0-2 (but with right cols22-23 as 3, mismatched), solid 8 blocks in rows3-15 (overridden only by left 1s in rows6-12), and bottom shifts like 9s full in row16-18/20-23 with partial 4s in row18, but lacks any patterned 8 frames seen in training expecteds (e.g., no paired 8s separated by bg in top/mid).
 * It overfills 8s similarly to training fails, with shifts (1s from presumed original, 9s/4s bottom) misaligned—e.g., 1s only left in rows6-12 suggest incomplete shift exclusion, and row14-15 solid 8s vs. likely expected interruptions; bottom 9s seem like a wide shifted shape but dominate too much without bg interruptions.
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: misses the "frame" motif (e.g., expected likely has 8 bars in specific cols like 4-5/12-13 or similar, with 2/3 bg patterns integrated), and right-edge 3s in top suggest bg detection issue or unhandled original elements; to fix, need patterned 8 placement and inclusive shifting of certain colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes a 25x24 input grid (with clues in row 1 and a 19x24 working area starting from row 6) to output a completed 19x24 grid by identifying background colors, detecting and propagating special "8" elements (likely representing propagatable or filled areas), placing seed pairs of 8s based on clue groups in row 1, and applying conditional fills in upper/lower/right sections. The puzzle involves color-coded rules for activating and positioning pairs, handling "property" rows (those containing 8s), and ensuring background (bkg) cells are overwritten only under specific conditions, resembling a constrained paint-by-numbers or blob-filling puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bkg) is the most common non-0/5/8 color in the working grid (rows 6-24); 5s are always replaced by bkg early on, but 0s and 8s are preserved or used as seeds.
 * Clue row (g[1]) has 4 groups starting at columns 1,7,13,19 (each 4 cells wide); each group has a key color (first non-0/5 value) that determines activation and pair positioning—e.g., color 1 in lower context or 4/6 in pos 0 activates left-leaning pairs, 2/4/6 in pos 3 activates right-leaning pairs; color 3 is neutral/inactive.
 * Seed pairs are computed separately for "upper" (first 3 groups, max_group=3, is_lower=False) and "lower" (last group or subsets, max_group=1, is_lower=True); pairs are 2-cell adjacent 8s placed at specific offsets (e.g., +1, +2, +3 from group start) based on color/position, with special handling like pair_start=18 for last group if color=2.
 * "has_prop" rows are indices i (0-18 for output rows 0-18) where input row 6+i contains any 8; max_prop_i is the highest such i, dividing the grid into upper (0 to max_prop_i) and lower (max_prop_i+1 to 18) sections for pair placement—upper uses upper_pairs, lower uses lower_pairs; additionally, all has_prop rows get lower_pairs overlaid.
 * Propagation: In has_prop rows, fill all bkg cells between the min and max column with 8s (horizontal expansion); this must happen after initial placements but before some fills.
 * Upper right fill: Find the first all-bkg row (upper_block_start) from row 0; fill min(2, remaining rows) starting there, from the rightmost upper pair start to col 23 with 8s, but only if the rightmost pair is at group_start+1 (is_plus1=True).
 * Lower right fill: If first group color is 1 or 2, start fill at row 13 (for 2) or 14 (for 1), for 2 rows, from the leftmost lower pair start to col 23 with 8s.
 * Subtleties: Pair activation skips if color=3 or no key color; lower pairs may override upper in overlap; propagation can expand existing 8s but only fills bkg (not overwriting other colors like 1/2/4/6/7); all-bkg checks use temp_output to avoid interference from prior placements; grid must be exactly 19x24 output with valid ints (error if not); existing non-bkg colors (e.g., 1,2,4,6,7) in output are preserved and not overwritten by 8s.
 * Edge cases: No has_prop means max_prop_i=-1, so upper covers all; empty pairs skip placements; last group (col 19-22) has off-by-one adjustments (e.g., pair_end <24); if no count in bkg detection, default to 3.
 * Common misses: Over-propagating 8s into non-bkg areas; wrong pair offsets (e.g., assuming fixed positions); not separating upper/lower logic properly; fills applying unconditionally; failing to preserve existing colors like 1/2/4 in expected outputs.

(Helpful for finding upper_block_start; used with temp_output to avoid placement interference—key subtlety.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented core structure (bkg detection, pair computation, has_prop detection, propagation, sectioned placements, conditional fills) but all training examples failed due to incorrect 8 placements and expansions.
 * Train 1: Correctly placed some upper pairs (e.g., 8s at cols 8-9 and 16-17 in rows 0-6) and lower pairs (e.g., cols 2-3 in rows 12-14), but failed to propagate 8s into cols 4-7 in rows 7-8 (generated 3s, expected 8s); over-placed 8s in row 6 cols 16-17 (should be 3s); wrong lower fill starting too early (cols 18-21 got 4s but no right-fill 8s); row 12 has extra 8s at 2-3 (not expected); propagation missed in row 14 (cols 4-23 should be 8s but partial).
 * Train 2: Partially correct upper pairs (e.g., 8s at 4-5,8-9 in early rows), but wrong in row 2 cols 13-19 (generated 1/8s, expected 8s across); lower section misplacements (e.g., row 10 has 8s at 4-15 but expected 1s at 4-7); row 12 has extra 8s at 0-3/20-23 (expected 1s); propagation failed in row 14 (cols 8-23 should be 8s); lower fill in rows 16-18 placed 8 at col 5 incorrectly (expected 1s there).
 * Train 3: Good initial pairs (e.g., 8s at 3-4,18-19 in rows 0-3), but failed upper propagation (rows 4-6 should have 8s at 8-17 but generated 7s/8s mismatched); row 6 has extra 8s at 0-3 (expected 7s); row 11 has 8s at 5-17 (expected partial); lower fill in rows 16-18 placed 8 at col 3 (expected 7); propagation in row 14 missed expanding to cols 20-23.
 * Pair logic worked partially (some expected 8 pairs match, like in train1 cols 8-9), but activation/offset rules are buggy (e.g., color=4 with next=2 not triggering +3 correctly; lower color=1 not always +3).
 * Section division via max_prop_i is helpful but misapplied—upper/lower placements overlap incorrectly, and has_prop overlay adds extras without checks.
 * Fills are over-aggressive: upper right applies even without is_plus1 in some cases; lower right uses wrong left_start (min pair instead of fixed).
 * Propagation is applied only to has_prop rows post-placement, but timing causes misses (e.g., needs re-propagation after fills?); doesn't handle vertical propagation.
 * Overall, preserves existing colors correctly (e.g., 1/2/4/6/7 not overwritten), but 8s overwrite bkg too selectively.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, though compute_seed_pairs has subtle bugs in offsets (e.g., for color=2 at end).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output provided—program errored with invalid format (<class 'list'>, likely returned [] or non-List[List[int]] due to early return if len(g)!=25 or len(g[0])!=24, suggesting test input didn't match expected dimensions).
 * Without output, cannot verify correctness, but based on training failures, it likely would mismatch: partial pairs/fills/propagation as seen in trains, potentially missing test-specific clues (e.g., unique color_pos or no has_prop). Test probably requires robust dimension check and default handling; error indicates lack of graceful fallbacks, making output unusable—does not look correct due to crash.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties that appear in **every** train example (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). These are limited to direct, repeatable effects or transformations (e.g., position changes, expansions, or splittings) that hold across all cases without variation in the core mechanism. Irrelevant or static elements (e.g., the orange top frame, which appears unchanged in inputs but is absent in outputs with no observed effect on other components) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear effects (e.g., exact hole count changes, pixel totals in splits, or color influences from top small blocks) are noted as unknown where they cannot be directly linked. No high-level interpretation or solution is provided; only pairwise component/property connections are listed.

#### 1. **Mid-level colored blocks (non-base, non-Maroon, pixels 24-63, holes=0) → Position transformation (y-shift)**
   - **Description**: These are rectangular or block-like components (e.g., horizontal bars or vertical strips) positioned in the mid-to-lower input area (y-ranges typically 6-24, excluding top y=1-4 and base). In every output, each such block retains its color, pixel count, width (x-range), height (y-range span), and holes=0, but is translated upward by exactly 6 units (all y-coordinates in bbox decreased by 6, potentially clipping or adjusting to y=0 boundary).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs for 3-4 such blocks per example (e.g., Yellow, Red, Green, Pink, Blue variants). Examples:
     - Train 1: Yellow [18,10,21,16] p=28 → [18,4,21,10] p=28; Red [4,22,14,24] p=33 → [4,16,14,18] p=33; Blue [0,9,3,17] p=36 → [0,3,3,11] p=36.
     - Train 2: Pink [13,6,17,7] p=10 → [13,0,17,1] p=10; Green [16,11,19,16] p=24 → [16,5,19,10] p=24; Red [0,11,3,17] p=28 → [0,5,3,11] p=28; Yellow [5,22,12,24] p=24 → [5,16,12,18] p=24.
     - Train 3: Green [8,6,17,9] p=40 → [8,0,17,3] p=40; Pink [20,9,23,19] p=44 → [20,3,23,13] p=44; Red [0,13,2,24] p=36 → [0,7,2,18] p=36; Yellow [8,22,21,24] p=42 → [8,16,21,18] p=42.
   - **Interconnection**: Input position (specifically y-bbox) directly effects output position (y-bbox shift). No effect on x-bbox, color, or size. This does not apply to top small blocks, base, or Maroon.

#### 2. **Small Maroon block (holes=0, bbox ~[8-12,13-18], pixels=4-9) → Size/position expansion**
   - **Description**: A single small, near-square Maroon component in the mid-lower input (always present, variable slight x/y position but consistent size/color). In every output, it expands into one large Maroon component that covers a broad horizontal area (x-range spanning most of 0-23, y-range fixed from 0 to ~15), increasing pixels to ~116-138. Holes change to 0-2 (unknown determination—varies without clear link to input properties like base holes or top positions).
   - **Consistency**: Always one input → one output Maroon; expansion mechanism (growth in area/bbox) is identical, though exact x-start (0-4) and holes vary slightly. Examples:
     - Train 1: [8,13,9,14] p=4 → [4,0,23,15] p=116 h=1.
     - Train 2: [8,14,9,15] p=4 → [4,0,23,15] p=124 h=0.
     - Train 3: [12,17,13,18] p=4 → [0,0,19,15] p=138 h=2.
   - **Interconnection**: Input position/size (small, localized) effects output position/size (large, top-anchored expansion). Color preserved. No observed direct effect on other components' colors or positions, but output bbox overlaps shifted mid-blocks in y=0-15 range (potential spatial interaction, but mechanism unknown).

#### 3. **Large base layer (holes=1-2, bbox ~[0,6-9,23,24+], pixels=290-408, variable color) → Splitting into multiple same-color components**
   - **Description**: The expansive base area (always one per input, covering bottom ~2/3 of grid, with holes=1-2). In every output, it splits into 4-6 smaller components of the *same color* (holes=0 for most), repositioned primarily at top (y=0-6) and sides/mid (y=4-18), with reduced total pixels (~200-250 aggregate, unknown loss mechanism). Bbox fragments vary (some vertical, some horizontal, widths 3-13 units).
   - **Consistency**: Always base color preserved and multiplied/fragmented; top fragments (y~0-6) always present (2-3 per output). Examples (base color noted):
     - Train 1 (Green base h=2 p=355) → 5 Green fragments h=0 (e.g., [0,0,7,6] p=40, [10,0,15,6] p=42, [10,0,23,13] p=96; total p~216).
     - Train 2 (Blue base h=2 p=366) → 6 Blue fragments h=0 (e.g., [0,0,3,4] p=20, [6,0,7,7] p=16, [10,0,13,7] p=30, [10,4,23,13] p=80; total p~226).
     - Train 3 (Dark Red base h=1 p=290) → 8 Dark Red fragments h=0 (e.g., [20,0,23,2] p=12, [0,0,2,3] p=12, [5,0,7,3] p=12, [0,6,2,6] p=3; total p~149).
   - **Interconnection**: Input holes/pixels/bbox (singular, bottom-heavy) effects output count/positions/sizes (multiple, top/side-distributed, same color). Exact split rules (e.g., how input holes=1-2 → output holes=0; pixel reduction; fragment shapes) unknown—no consistent link to other input properties like top positions or Maroon.

#### 4. **Top small vertical blocks (4 per input, holes=0, bbox ~[x,1,x,4], pixels=4 each, variable colors/positions) → Absence with indirect position/color influence (unknown)**
   - **Description**: Always exactly 4 narrow vertical blocks at fixed y=1-4, variable x (e.g., 1,7,13,19) and colors (e.g., Blue/Pink/Yellow/Red/Green). They do not appear in outputs in their original form (no direct shift or preservation). However, outputs consistently introduce 2-3 new small top components (y=0-3, pixels=10-12, base color) whose x-positions roughly align with or between input top x-values (e.g., gaps or clusters at x=0-7,10-15).
   - **Consistency**: Always 4 input → 0 direct outputs, but new top fragments in base color appear in similar x-regions. Examples:
     - Train 1 (x=1,7,13,19) → Output top Greens at x=0-7,10-15 (overlapping input x-clusters).
     - Train 2 (x=4,7,16,19) → Output top Blues at x=0-3,6-7,10-13,18-23 (spanning input x).
     - Train 3 (x=4,7,13,22) → Output top Dark Reds at x=0-2,5-7,20-23 (matching/near input x).
   - **Interconnection**: Input positions (x-values) and colors effect output top fragment positions (x-clustering in base color), but exact mapping (e.g., which color goes where; why base color used) unknown. No preservation of their own colors or y-shift.

No other consistent interactions observed (e.g., no reliable color-to-color effects, hole-to-position links, or pixel-based transformations across all examples). Elements like black voids or purple/green accents from the description are not present in the data, so no connections identifiable.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input result: ERROR - Program returned invalid grid format: <class 'list'>
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 23:42:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle involving a 25x24 input grid (with clues in early rows) where the goal is to process and modify the lower 19 rows of a scene by detecting background colors, interpreting clue groups to place or extend "8" values (likely representing props, fills, or extensions), handling special pairing rules for upper and lower sections, and applying propagation rules like vertical/horizontal extensions and fills based on prop positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection: Identify the most common non-special (non-0,5,8) value in the output grid as background (bkg), then replace all 5's with it; this works but may fail if ties or special cases alter counts.
 * Clue interpretation: Clues in row 1 are divided into 4 groups of 4 cells (starts at 1,7,13,19); extract color (first non-0/5 value) and position (offset 0-3) per group using get_group_info; colors like 1-6 trigger specific activations for pairs or fills, with skips for certain combinations (e.g., color 4 with next 2 skips next group).
 * Upper pairs: For rows 0 to max_prop_row (where props=8 exist), place horizontal pairs of 8's in bkg areas based on clue activations (e.g., pos=0 with color 4/6 starts pair at +1 or +3; pos=3 with 2/4/6 adjusts start); includes skip logic for chained activations.
 * Lower pairs/special: For rows 16+ or prop rows, similar but limited (e.g., only for first group color=1 at pos=0 or color=4 at pos=3); special handling if first color=1/2 for left-to-right fills in rows 14-15 starting from min pair/col positions.
 * Prop propagation: For each column with original 8's, extend 8's upward from min_row and downward from max_row into adjacent bkg cells until non-bkg; also horizontal fill between min/max 8-cols in prop rows and specific rows (14,15).
 * Rightmost upper block fill: If rightmost upper pair starts at group_start+1, find first all-bkg upper row and fill rightward from pair start for up to 2 rows.
 * Subtleties: Max_prop_i limits upper fills to before last prop row; orig_min/max_row track original 8 positions before modifications; horizontal fills only in bkg gaps within 8-col ranges; potential overfill in chains (e.g., color 4+next2 skips but still pairs); lower fills start from 16 but may apply earlier in prop rows; entire rows 14-15 get rightward fills if first color=1/2, but only from left_fill_start.
 * Easy to miss: Pair positions must be <24 and +1 valid; for last group (start=19), pos=3 pair_start=18; vertical extensions stop at non-bkg; background count excludes 0/5/8 but defaults to 3 if empty; prop rows (with any 8) trigger extra horizontal fills.
 * Grid format: Output must be exactly 19x24 List[List[int]], no errors; input validation checks len(g)=25 and len(row)=24.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = Counter()
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in [0, 5, 8]:
                count[cell] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 3
```
(This reliably detects bkg; useful for replacing 5's and checking empty areas for fills.)

```python
def get_group_info(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val, p
    return 0, -1

def get_clue_color(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> int:
    return get_group_info(clue_row, group_start)[0]
```
(These extract per-group color/pos from clues; essential for all activations; handles 0/5 as skips.)

```python
def get_has_prop_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    has_prop = []
    for i in range(19):
        if any(cell == 8 for cell in grid[6 + i]):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Identifies rows with original props=8; key for limiting upper fills and triggering specials; max() gives boundary.)

```python
def compute_upper_pairs_with_skip(clue: List[int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    group_starts = [1, 7, 13, 19]
    pairs = []
    skip_next = False
    for gi in range(4):
        if skip_next:
            skip_next = False
            continue
        start = group_starts[gi]
        color, pos = get_group_info(clue, start)
        if color == 0 or color == 3:
            continue
        activate = False
        pair_start = -1
        if pos == 0:
            if color in [4, 6]:
                activate = True
                if color == 6:
                    pair_start = start + 1
                elif color == 4:
                    next_c = 0
                    if gi < 3:
                        next_c = get_clue_color(clue, group_starts[gi + 1])
                    if next_c == 2:
                        pair_start = start + 3
                        skip_next = True
                    else:
                        pair_start = start + 1
        elif pos == 3:
            if color in [2, 4, 6]:
                activate = True
                if color == 2:
                    pair_start = start + 3
                    if start == 19:
                        pair_start = 18
                elif color == 4:
                    pair_start = start + 2
                    skip_next = True
                elif color == 6:
                    pair_start = start + 1
        if activate and pair_start != -1 and pair_start + 1 < 24:
            pairs.append((pair_start, pair_start + 1))
    return pairs
```
(This computes upper pair positions with skip logic; partially works but misses some activations or placements.)

```python
# Vertical/horizontal extension logic (from main program)
orig_min_row = {j: 19 for j in range(24)}
orig_max_row = {j: -1 for j in range(24)}
for i in range(19):
    for j in range(24):
        if g[6 + i][j] == 8:  # Original props
            orig_min_row[j] = min(orig_min_row[j], i)
            orig_max_row[j] = max(orig_max_row[j], i)
for j in range(24):
    if orig_max_row[j] >= 0:
        min_i = orig_min_row[j]
        for k in range(min_i - 1, -1, -1):
            if output[k][j] == bkg:
                output[k][j] = 8
            else:
                break
        max_i = orig_max_row[j]
        for k in range(max_i + 1, 19):
            if output[k][j] == bkg:
                output[k][j] = 8
            else:
                break
```
(This tracks original 8 positions and extends vertically into bkg; helpful for propagation but applied too late or without originals preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1: Fully correct, indicating core background replacement, basic pair placement in upper rows, and some extensions work well for simple cases.
 * Train 2: Incorrect; generated misses rightward 8-fills in rows 2-3 (positions 16-23 should be 8's but are 1's/bkg); row 4 has correct partial but expected has more 8's in 16-23? No, row 4 matches expected in provided snippet, but row 2-3 differ (generated has isolated 8-pairs without full row fill); lower rows 14-15 have correct 8-fills, but upper prop extensions incomplete; likely upper pair logic or block fill misses chaining to full rows.
 * Train 2: Rows 0-1 match expected (6's in 13-17); but rows 2-4 show partial pairs (e.g., 13-15 as 1's in generated row 2 vs 8's in expected); horizontal fills in prop rows (e.g., row 8-9) match, but vertical upward from props doesn't fully propagate to upper empty areas.
 * Train 3: Incorrect; major differences in upper-mid rows—e.g., row 4 generated has 7's in 0-7/15-17 where expected has full 8's across 0-14; row 5-6 generated has isolated 7's vs expected full 8's in 0-14; row 14 generated has 7's in 15-19 vs expected 7's only partial; suggests upper pair activations or bkg checks fail, leading to no fills in wide areas; lower rows 16-18 match expected 4's and 7's.
 * Train 3: Row 0-2 match; row 3 partial (20-23=7's vs 6's? No, expected row 3 has 6's in 20-23, generated matches); but row 4-6 over-rely on bkg without placing wide 8-blocks from clues; horizontal fills in row 7+ partial but miss left extensions; vertical extensions apply but don't cover full widths.
 * General: compute_lower_pairs and special lower_pair_for_special partially work (e.g., Train 2 rows 16+ correct), but range for lower fills is wrong (hardcoded 16 to 16? Typo in code: range(max_prop_i +1 if ... else 16, 16) is empty); upper_pairs_with_skip handles skips but misses some pos=0/3 cases or rightmost adjustments; rightmost block fill activates but num_rows= min(2, ...) may underfill; first_color=1/2 left_fill_start min() works but overfills if orig_min_col wrong; orig_min/max_row computed before some fills, so misses propagated 8's; prop row horizontal fills apply but only after pairs, causing gaps.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The lower_pairs range loop is broken (range(a,16) with a>=16 does nothing); upper block fill assumes max_prop_i but may not find upper_block_start correctly if no all-bkg row; entire program returns output but test errors on format (likely due to g[6:25] slicing if input invalid, or empty return on len check).

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an ERROR: "Program returned invalid grid format: <class 'list'>", indicating the function returned a flat list instead of List[List[int]]; this suggests a bug in output construction (e.g., slicing g[6:25] failed or row[:] copied wrong, or early return [] flattened somehow).
 * No actual grid generated, so cannot verify correctness; likely the input grid doesn't meet len=25x24, triggering empty return, but error message implies type mismatch rather than empty—program understanding is incomplete for edge cases like invalid inputs.
 * Without output, it doesn't make sense; fix validation/output copy first, then check if pairs/fills apply similarly to trains (e.g., expect bkg replacements and 8-extensions based on clues, but unknown without test input details).

[2025-10-02 23:42:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 00:06:32] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top rows define active colors and patterns, and the task is to transform the lower "base field" (rows 5-23) by identifying maroon (8) patches, extending them horizontally and vertically into pillars, filling connections between pillars while respecting active colors, clearing non-maroon elements below patches, and adding full horizontal connections in background areas to link to the bottom, ultimately outputting the first 19 rows of the modified grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The base field is always the lower 19 rows (g[5:24]), with borders (5's) replaced by background (3's) to simplify processing.
 * Active colors are unique non-0, non-5 values from rows 1-4 of the input grid; these must not be overwritten except where explicitly filling with 8's, and fills only occur on background (3) or non-active cells.
 * Maroon patches are contiguous horizontal sequences of 8's in the base field; the code assumes a single patch but should handle multiples via patch_infos list—subtlety: patches may shift after horizontal fills, so compute pillar positions post-fill.
 * Horizontal fills extend 8's left/right from each patch until hitting an active color or edge, but only at the patch row itself.
 * Pillars: Upper pillars (above patch) include left pillar (aligned to extended left), patch pillar, and right pillar (aligned to extended right); for the row immediately above the patch, add a full fill between the outermost pillars if background. Lower pillars (below patch) only include left and patch pillars, without right or full fills, and extend down fully.
 * Clearing below patch: Starting from the row after the patch, replace all active colors (except 8's) with 3's to remove obstructions, but preserve any existing 8's or background.
 * Full connections below: In rows sufficiently below the patch (e.g., after 2-3 pillar rows), if a row segment from left pillar start to near-right edge is all background (3's), fill it entirely with 8's to create horizontal links; leave space at bottom edges and avoid overfilling near active areas.
 * Subtle elements: Pillar widths must match the original patch width for alignment (e.g., right_pillar_left = right_end - patch_width + 1); upper fills may need to handle varying active interferences per row; lower sections often end with pattern-specific bars or fills (e.g., full 8 rows or color bars) that aren't cleared/overwritten; multiple patches require independent processing without interference; the output must exactly match expected row-by-row, including preserving top patterns like 1's, 2's, 4's in specific positions.
 * Edge cases: Patches may be off-center; active colors in lower rows block fills but aren't cleared until after pillar application; bottom 2-3 rows often preserve input patterns (e.g., color bars) without 8 fills; if no patches, return unmodified base field (but all examples have patches).
 * General: Grid width is 24 columns; deepcopy to avoid mutating input; process upper/lower separately after horizontal fills; avoid filling active colors or beyond grid edges.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and extracts the base field, replaces 5's with 3's, and gets active colors from top rows, which works across all examples as a solid foundation.
 * Horizontal fills at patch rows are mostly correct (e.g., extends 8's properly in train 1 and 2), but in train 3, it overextends or misaligns due to pre-existing actives like 7's blocking partially.
 * Pillar computation post-fill is helpful but buggy: in train 1, it sets left_pillar incorrectly, leading to no left pillar in upper rows (generated has empty left in rows 0-3, but expected has 1's preserved and no extra 8's there); upper pillars apply patch and right but miss full left+fill in immediate above row, resulting in row 4 having 1's instead of full 8's connection.
 * Lower pillars in train 1 apply left and patch correctly but fail to preserve expected 1's in rows 9-11 (generated clears to 3's and adds unnecessary 8's in right, but expected keeps 1's and shifts to 3's/4's); clearing active below works partially but over-clears preserved patterns like the 1's bar.
 * In train 2, upper pillars overfill row 0 with 1's into 8's (generated row 0 has 1's overwritten, but expected preserves them); horizontal fills miss the full right extension in rows 2-3 (generated has partial 8's, expected full 8's across right); lower clearing removes too much, turning expected 1's/3's into 8's in rows 12-16, and full connections below are absent or mistimed (no full 8's in rows 14-15 as expected).
 * Train 3 generated mismatches heavily: upper rows 0-3 have 7's preserved but no 8 extensions into them (expected has 8's starting row 0); patch at row 4-7 fills incorrectly, adding extra 8's in left/right where 7's should block; lower pillars extend wrong (e.g., row 8 has 2's overwritten partially, expected preserves 2's left); full connections below are missing (rows 14-16 should have more 8's connecting 7's, but generated has gaps); bottom rows 17-18 clear 4's incorrectly to 3's/8's, but expected keeps 4's bar.
 * add_full_connections_below is unhelpful/broken: arbitrary start_r= patch_r+3 and checks only partial width (left_start to width-3), leading to no fills in train 1 (expected full 8's in row 14), partial in train 2, and none in train 3; it ignores active interferences and bottom preservation.
 * clear_active_below_patch over-applies, removing expected active patterns below (e.g., 1's in train 1 row 9-11, 1's in train 2 rows 12-18, 7's/4's in train 3 rows 16-18); it should skip certain bottom rows or only clear non-connector actives.
 * apply_upper_pillars has logic for immediate above full fill but miscalculates min_fill/max_fill bounds (e.g., in train 1, it fills too narrowly, missing connection to 4's); it also applies to all upper rows including where actives like 1's block, but doesn't preserve them properly.
 * apply_lower_pillars misses right pillar in some cases and doesn't handle multiple patches; in train 2, it adds extra 8's in row 16-17 where expected has 1's/4's.
 * Overall, the single-patch assumption works for these but may fail multiples; deepcopy is good but excessive copies slow it; no handling for patch row variations (e.g., train 1 patch at row 7, train 2 at row 3, train 3 at row 0? wait, base indexing).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it starts with a top row of partial 8's but then has full 2's bars in rows 1-3 (likely from uncleared input patterns), which shouldn't be overwritten unless part of pillars, but expected likely needs 8 extensions into them based on patch at row 4.
 * Rows 4-6 show 9's preserved around central 8's patch, but horizontal fills seem incomplete (no extension left/right beyond 9's, whereas expected should fill to edges or actives); upper pillars in row 7-8 incorrectly overwrite 1's/9's with 8's without full connection.
 * Lower sections (rows 9-18) have repetitive 8's pillars but overextend into 9's areas without blocking, and row 18 has a weird partial 8's/3's mix with 9's, suggesting clearing failed to remove actives properly while missing full horizontal connections below (expected probably has full 8's links in background rows and preserves bottom 9's bar).
 * No full connections added below (e.g., rows 14-17 are pillar-only, but test likely needs horizontal 8's in all-3 segments to connect to bottom 9's); the output ignores active 9's blocking, leading to overfills, and bottom row 18 doesn't match typical bar preservation seen in training (e.g., no clean 9's bar).
 * Overall, it partially captures pillars but fails on preservation, blocking, and connections, making it incoherent compared to training expectations—e.g., too many 8's in right columns without justification, and missing upper connections.

[2025-10-03 00:06:32] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 00:30:57] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Rule: Create a deep copy of the input grid to avoid mutating the original
    return [row[:] for row in g]

    # Observation: The seed row is the first row containing the fill color 2 (maroon), typically in the main area
    h = len(g)
    for r in range(h):
        if 2 in g[r]:
            return r
    return -1  # No seed found

def detect_clue_cols(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    # Observation: Clue columns are detected in row 1 (top pattern row), at approximate section starts every 6 columns,
    # where the cell is a non-background, non-border, non-empty color (clues for branches)
    w = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    clue_cols = []
    for c in range(1, w - 1, 6):  # Step of 6 to hit section starts like 1,7,13,19,...
        if g[1][c] not in (0, 6, 8):

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

    # fill horizontal at seed row to connect across, fill vertical branches full height to link top to bottom
    new_g = copy_grid(g)
    seed_r = find_seed_row(new_g)
    h, w = len(new_g), len(new_g[0]) if new_g else 0

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 00:33:04] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving filling specific paths or branches (likely a tree, river, or connection puzzle) with a fill color (2 for maroon) starting from a seed element, guided by clues in the top rows, while respecting borders, regions, and empty spaces (0 or 8), without overwriting existing non-background elements like borders (3,5,6,7,9) or clues (1,4).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves regional boundaries defined by border colors (e.g., 3,5,7,9 act as walls that filling cannot cross; 6 may be special borders or clues).
 * Filling with 2 should only occur in background (0) or empty/unfilled (8) cells, but must be constrained to puzzle regions (e.g., between borders), not the entire grid—overfilling across borders is a major error.
 * Seed detection: The "seed" is likely a starting point for horizontal connection (often a partial 2 line in a middle row), but not necessarily the first row with any 2; it may be the primary horizontal trunk row.
 * Clue detection: Clues for vertical branches are in the top pattern row (row 1), but not strictly every 6 columns—detection should look for non-background/non-border cells (e.g., 1,3,4,6) that indicate branch starts, and branches may not span full height but stop at region boundaries or other clues.
 * Vertical filling: Branches from clues should fill downward/upward only within the current region (e.g., until hitting a border or another filled area), connecting to the horizontal seed but not extending beyond puzzle sections.
 * Horizontal filling: Connect across the seed row but only within the main playable area (skipping borders like column 0 or 23), and only where 0/8; do not fill the entire width if borders block.
 * Subtle elements: Some regions have internal dividers (e.g., vertical 1s or 4s that limit spread); 8s are pre-empty spaces to fill, but existing 2s in input should be preserved/extended; puzzles have multiple sections (e.g., left/middle/right panels separated by borders); bottom rows may have partial fills or patterns that interact with verticals.
 * Overall goal: Create connected paths (horizontal trunk + vertical branches) that match expected filled regions, often leaving some 8s unfilled if not part of the connection; avoid filling clue areas or borders.
 * Easy to miss: Clue columns aren't uniform (e.g., in train 1, clues at cols ~8-9,16-17; step of 6 misses some); seed row may have existing 2s that need extension, not full overwrite; verticals may need to stop at horizontal barriers (e.g., full rows of 3s or 1s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Rule: Create a deep copy of the input grid to avoid mutating the original
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for safe manipulation.)

```python
def find_seed_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Observation: The seed row is the first row containing the fill color 2 (maroon), typically in the main area
    h = len(g)
    for r in range(h):
        if 2 in g[r]:
            return r
    return -1  # No seed found
```
(This is partially helpful for locating the trunk row, but may need refinement to find the primary horizontal seed, not any 2.)

```python
def fill_horizontal(g: List[List[int]], r: int, start_c: int, end_c: int) -> None:
    # Rule: Fill horizontal line at row r from start_c to end_c with 2 (maroon) only in background (0) or empty (8) cells
    for c in range(start_c, end_c + 1):
        if g[r][c] in (0, 8):
            g[r][c] = 2
```
(This is helpful for targeted horizontal filling, but needs better start/end detection to respect borders.)

```python
def fill_vertical(g: List[List[int]], c: int, start_r: int, end_r: int) -> None:
    # Rule: Fill vertical line at column c from start_r to end_r with 2 (maroon) only in background (0) or empty (8) cells
    for r in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        if g[r][c] in (0, 8):
            g[r][c] = 2
```
(This is helpful for vertical branches, but start_r/end_r must be region-bounded, not full height.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly copies the grid and only fills 0/8 cells, avoiding overwrites of borders/clues— this worked well across all examples.
 * Seed row detection found rows with initial 2s (e.g., row 1 in train 1/2/3 and test), which is a good start for identifying the trunk.
 * Horizontal filling extended existing 2s in the seed row, partially matching expected connections (e.g., in train 1, it filled some 0s to 2s in row 1 cols 2-4,8-10,14-16,20-22, but overdid it by filling across borders like col 0/23 which stayed 5 but disrupted regions).
 * Vertical filling from detected clues connected some branches (e.g., in train 1, filled col 7? but code targets cols 1,7,13,19; actually filled cols based on row1 non-0/6/8, but step 6 missed some like col 19-20 pair).
 * However, clue column detection with fixed step 6 failed: In train 1, it hit cols 1,7,13,19 but clues are paired (e.g., 8-9,16-17? wait, row1 has 1 at col1,6 at7,4 at13,2 at19-22— so detected 1,13,19 but missed nuances; generated verticals overfilled full height, ignoring borders like row5-6 full 5s.
 * Full horizontal fill (0 to w-1) ignored borders, filling into border areas (e.g., train 1 row1 col0/23 stayed 5, but middle overfilled beyond regions; expected no full row1 2s, instead partial vertical 8-to-2 in lower areas).
 * Vertical full height (0 to h-1) overfilled: In train 1, it filled cols 1,13,19 full down, turning many 3s/1s/4s areas to 2 where shouldn't (but code skips non-0/8, so only filled 0/8, but still wrong extent—e.g., generated row22-24 full 2s in cols4-14, but expected only bottom row16-18 partial 2s).
 * In train 1, generated mismatched by filling top row1 horizontal fully with 2s (e.g., [5,1,2,2,2,5,...] became all 2s where 0, but expected keeps top as clues and fills lower 8s to 2 in specific vertical/horizontal pockets like rows3-15 cols8-9/16-17 to 2, but actually expected shows 8s remaining in some, 2s only in bottom horizontal row16 cols4-14 and partial verticals.
 * Train 1 also mismatched blob shapes: Generated bottom rows22-24 as partial 2s only cols4-15, but expected row16 cols4-14 2s; unknown why, but likely because seed was row1, not bottom.
 * In train 2, similar overfill: Horizontal in row1 filled to [5,2,2,2,2,5,...], verticals in cols1,7,13,17? (detected row1 non-0/6/8: col1=2? input row1 [5,2,2,2,2,5,5,4,2,2,2,5,5,2,2,2,6,5,5,3,2,2,2,5] so cols1-4,7-10,13-15,19-22; step6 hit 1,7,13,19—filled those vertical full, turning many 1s areas wrong, e.g., row6-23 cols1,7,13,19 to 2 where 0/8, but expected has 8-to-2 in scattered verticals like cols4-5,8-9 and horizontal in row5 cols0-3/20-23? Wait, expected row0-1 cols4-5/8-9 to 8, row2-4 cols12-19? to 8, but 2s in row5 cols0-3, row6-10 cols0-3/16-19, etc.—mismatch in not filling 8s to 2 in branch pockets and overfilling seed.
 * Train 2 generated row11-12 cols0-3 as 2s (from vertical col1), but expected row5 cols0-3 as 2s (different seed?); unknown reason for row shift.
 * In train 3, clue detection step6 hit cols1,7,13,19 (row1 [5,2,2,2,4,5,5,6,2,2,2,5,5,3,2,2,2,5,5,2,2,2,2,5] so cols1-3,8-10,13-17,19-22; detected 1,7,13,19—filled vertical full, but overfilled into 7/3 areas; generated row13 cols3 as 2? but expected has 8-to-2 in cols3-4 rows0-3/19-20 rows3-? and full vertical 8s in col3 rows13-16? Mismatch: generated bottom row24 cols8-21 as 4s unchanged but horizontals wrong.
 * Function detect_clue_cols is broken/not helpful: Fixed step 6 assumes uniform 6-col sections, but sections vary (e.g., train1 has ~6 but paired clues; train3 has overlapping); better to scan row1 for specific clue patterns (non-0/6/8 clusters).
 * The program(g) composition is unhelpful overall: It assumes full-grid fills post-seed, ignoring region detection—leads to overfill; no boundary finding for sections.
 * No function for region detection (e.g., find borders to limit fills)—essential, as all mismatches stem from ignoring sections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills similar to training examples, with full horizontal 2s in row1 (e.g., [5,1,2,2,2,5,...] filled to 2s across where 0, ignoring borders at cols0/5/6/11/etc.), and vertical full-height 2s in detected cols (row1 clues:1 at1,2 at7-9,3 at10,2 at13-16,2 at19-22; step6 hits1,7,13,19—fills those down, turning row6 cols1/7/13/19 to 2, row9-10 full 2s? Wait, row6 is [2,2,2,...] already filled horizontal, but lower row13-16 cols3? as 1-to-2 wrong, row22-24 cols7? as 4s unchanged but adjacent 2s overfill).
 * It mismatches expected logic: Likely expected should fill 8s to 2 in specific branch pockets (e.g., row13 cols8-10 to 2 vertical, connecting to bottom), partial horizontal in row6 (already 2s, extend within 2/9 borders), and verticals only to region ends (e.g., stop at row21 full 9s); instead, generated has extraneous 2s in row9-10 full (over seed?), and unfilled 8s in row13 cols8-10 remain 8? No, vertical col7/13 would fill them if 0/8, but step6 may miss col8-10 clue cluster.
 * Test has unique elements like 9 borders (thicker sections?), row6 partial 2s as seed (not row1), clues in row1 with 1,2,3,4 indicating branch types/directions; generated treats row1 as seed (first 2), wrong—output has row6 overfilled to full 2s across borders (cols21-23 stay 3, but cols0-20 2s where possible), missing pocket fills like row13-15 cols8-10/ ? to 2.
 * Does not make sense: Overfills ignore 9/3 borders (e.g., row9-12 cols0-20 stay 9 but verticals punch through to row13 1s as 2 wrong); bottom row24-26 4s unchanged but adjacent 2s from verticals spill; expected likely connected tree with 2s in row6 horizontal within cols0-20, verticals from row1 clues down to row6 then branch to bottom pockets, leaving some 8s as empty.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 00:33:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating a Python program containing a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input, following unspecified puzzle rules for interpreting or transforming the grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid elements (e.g., extracting objects, counting features like holes or blobs, matching shapes), but no specific rules are provided—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or omissions based on criteria (e.g., hole counts or stretches across grid).
 * Inputs are grids (List[List[int]]), so code must parse 2D structures accurately; outputs should match expected puzzle solutions, possibly as strings, grids, or classifications.
 * All attempts must demonstrate puzzle understanding through correct handling of training examples before test; failures indicate lack of core structure.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure function signature matches expected (e.g., def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> ...); avoid syntax errors or unrelated code that prevents execution.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle rules extracted yet, so focus on boilerplate structure first; future attempts need functions for grid traversal, object detection (e.g., connected components), and rule application.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function entirely. Placeholder for future use:
```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> list:
    # Example: Identify connected components or blobs in grid
    # (Not implemented; essential for puzzles involving object counting or shape matching)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating the code was incomplete or lacked the entry point.
 * No puzzle logic was executed, so nothing worked—zero progress on visual rules, object extraction, or output generation.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the core requirement (presence of 'program' function), making it entirely unhelpful.
 * No functions like grid parsing or object extraction were present, so none can be salvaged; avoid generating non-functional code without the main function.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR due to missing 'program' function, so it does not make sense or look correct—it failed before any puzzle processing.
 * No actual output was generated for the test input, making it impossible to verify against expected puzzle solution (e.g., no grid transformation or rule application occurred).
 * This highlights that structural compliance is prerequisite; without it, test handling (e.g., applying rules to the specific test grid) cannot be assessed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving filling specific paths or branches (likely a tree, river, or connection puzzle) with a fill color (2 for maroon) starting from a seed element, guided by clues in the top rows, while respecting borders, regions, and empty spaces (0 or 8), without overwriting existing non-background elements like borders (3,5,6,7,9) or clues (1,4).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves regional boundaries defined by border colors (e.g., 3,5,7,9 act as walls that filling cannot cross; 6 may be special borders or clues).
 * Filling with 2 should only occur in background (0) or empty/unfilled (8) cells, but must be constrained to puzzle regions (e.g., between borders), not the entire grid—overfilling across borders is a major error.
 * Seed detection: The "seed" is likely a starting point for horizontal connection (often a partial 2 line in a middle row), but not necessarily the first row with any 2; it may be the primary horizontal trunk row.
 * Clue detection: Clues for vertical branches are in the top pattern row (row 1), but not strictly every 6 columns—detection should look for non-background/non-border cells (e.g., 1,3,4,6) that indicate branch starts, and branches may not span full height but stop at region boundaries or other clues.
 * Vertical filling: Branches from clues should fill downward/upward only within the current region (e.g., until hitting a border or another filled area), connecting to the horizontal seed but not extending beyond puzzle sections.
 * Horizontal filling: Connect across the seed row but only within the main playable area (skipping borders like column 0 or 23), and only where 0/8; do not fill the entire width if borders block.
 * Subtle elements: Some regions have internal dividers (e.g., vertical 1s or 4s that limit spread); 8s are pre-empty spaces to fill, but existing 2s in input should be preserved/extended; puzzles have multiple sections (e.g., left/middle/right panels separated by borders); bottom rows may have partial fills or patterns that interact with verticals.
 * Overall goal: Create connected paths (horizontal trunk + vertical branches) that match expected filled regions, often leaving some 8s unfilled if not part of the connection; avoid filling clue areas or borders.
 * Easy to miss: Clue columns aren't uniform (e.g., in train 1, clues at cols ~8-9,16-17; step of 6 misses some); seed row may have existing 2s that need extension, not full overwrite; verticals may need to stop at horizontal barriers (e.g., full rows of 3s or 1s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Rule: Create a deep copy of the input grid to avoid mutating the original
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for safe manipulation.)

```python
def find_seed_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Observation: The seed row is the first row containing the fill color 2 (maroon), typically in the main area
    h = len(g)
    for r in range(h):
        if 2 in g[r]:
            return r
    return -1  # No seed found
```
(This is partially helpful for locating the trunk row, but may need refinement to find the primary horizontal seed, not any 2.)

```python
def fill_horizontal(g: List[List[int]], r: int, start_c: int, end_c: int) -> None:
    # Rule: Fill horizontal line at row r from start_c to end_c with 2 (maroon) only in background (0) or empty (8) cells
    for c in range(start_c, end_c + 1):
        if g[r][c] in (0, 8):
            g[r][c] = 2
```
(This is helpful for targeted horizontal filling, but needs better start/end detection to respect borders.)

```python
def fill_vertical(g: List[List[int]], c: int, start_r: int, end_r: int) -> None:
    # Rule: Fill vertical line at column c from start_r to end_r with 2 (maroon) only in background (0) or empty (8) cells
    for r in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        if g[r][c] in (0, 8):
            g[r][c] = 2
```
(This is helpful for vertical branches, but start_r/end_r must be region-bounded, not full height.)

 * Vertical filling from detected clues connected some branches (e.g., in train 1, filled col 7? but code targets cols 1,7,13,19; actually filled cols based on row1 non-0/6/8, but step 6 missed some like col 19-20 pair).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 25-row grid (including clue rows at the top) to generate a 19-row output grid by identifying background colors, placing "seeds" (marked as 8) based on clue interpretations in specific positions and rows, propagating those 8's horizontally in certain "prop" rows (based on original 8 placements or rules), and filling remaining background areas while preserving other colored elements (like 1,2,4,6,9). The goal is to complete incomplete grid sections (marked with 5 as placeholders) according to visual logic rules derived from clues, likely a custom colored fill-in puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bkg) is determined by uniform rows excluding 5's; fallback to 3 if none found—must handle cases where bkg is 1,3,7,9 across examples.
 * Clue row (g[1]) uses groups at positions [1:5,7:11,13:17,19:23]; non-0/5 values indicate colors (1,2,3,4,6) that trigger seed pair placements (consecutive positions for 8's) based on position within group (0 or 3) and color-specific rules (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may shift pair based on next group, color 1 for lower rows shifts differently).
 * Seeds are placed as pairs of 8's in upper rows (0-15, using upper pairs up to max prop row) or lower rows (switching to lower pairs after max prop); only overwrite bkg areas.
 * Propagation of 8's: In rows with original 8's (has_prop), extend left/right from min/max 8 positions and fill gaps between 8's with 8's (assuming bkg in between); subtle: only in rows 0-15, and doesn't overwrite non-bkg.
 * Upper block (initial all-bkg rows) may get right-side propagation of 8's if "plus1" condition (rightmost seed starts at group_start+1) and limited to 2 rows.
 * Lower prop rows depend on first clue color (1→rows 14-15 right-fill from leftmost lower seed; 2→rows 13-14 same); fill rightward from seed start to end if bkg.
 * Replace all 5's with bkg globally after initial copy.
 * Subtleties: Upper/lower seed computation differs (is_lower flag affects activation for color 1 at pos 0); pair starts/ends vary by color/pos (e.g., color 6 at pos 0→start+1; color 2 at pos 3→start+3, special for last group); max_group limits (3 for upper,1 for lower); preserve non-bkg colors (1,2,4,6,9) and don't propagate over them.
 * Grid is 19 output rows x 24 cols; input may have full 25 rows with clues in 0-5? but code uses g[6:25] and g[1] as clue.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only in specific rows; seeds only in bkg areas; rightmost upper prop only if is_plus1 and in upper block; lower prop only if seeds exist and specific first color; no vertical propagation.
 * Other: Original 8's in input determine has_prop and max_prop_i (last such row); fallback bkg=3 may fail if true bkg differs (e.g., 1 or 7 in ex2/ex3).

            else:  # color == 1 and is_lower
                pair_start = start + 3
        else:  # color_pos == 3
            if color == 2:
                pair_start = start + 3
                if start == 19:
                    pair_start = 18
            elif color == 4:

            elif color == 6:
                pair_start = start + 1
        pair_end = pair_start + 1
        if pair_end < 24:
            seed_pairs.append((pair_start, pair_end))
    return seed_pairs
```
These functions handle clue parsing and seed placement core logic; they seem partially correct but need tuning for pair positions and activation (e.g., color 1 handling).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of propagation and seed placement rules.
 * Train 1: Generated missing 8's in prop rows (e.g., row 9 has 3's instead of 8's at cols 4-5 and 8-9; row 10 similar; row 11 has 3's at 4-5/8-9; row 12 has 3's at 2-3 instead of 8's; row 13 similar; upper block prop not applied correctly, leading to no right-side 8's in early rows).
 * Train 1: Lower prop not triggered (first_clue_color likely 1 or 2, but no right-fill in rows 13-15 from seeds); seeds placed but propagation gaps not filled properly.
 * Train 2: Background detection failed (used 1? but prop extended incorrectly, e.g., row 10 has 8's at 4-5/8-9/14-17 but expected 1's at 4-5; row 11 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 12 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 15 has 8's at 4-5/8-9 but expected 1's; lower prop overfills with 8's where bkg=1 should remain).
 * Train 2: Seeds placed in upper but switched to lower too early or incorrectly; prop in has_prop rows overwrote non-bkg (1's) with 8's in gaps; no handling for color 6 in clues properly.
 * Train 3: Background=7 correct, but seeds misplaced (e.g., row 0 has 8's at 8-9 but expected at 3-4; entire upper structure wrong—no 8's at expected positions like 3-4/19-20; prop in rows 4-6 overfills with 7's instead of 8's; row 7 has 2's at 0-2 but no 8's at 3-4; row 12 has 8's at 12-13 but expected full 8's row; lower rows like 16-18 have 4's starting at col 8 but bkg=7 not propagated correctly).
 * Train 3: Upper block detection failed (no initial all-bkg rows, but prop not applied to right side); lower prop not handled (first_clue_color= ? but no right-fill); pair computation for color 2/4/6 positions off (e.g., special last-group adjustment not triggering correctly).
 * Overall: compute_seed_pairs activates correctly for some colors but pair_start/end positions often wrong (e.g., shifts for color 4 based on next=2 not always accurate; color 1 lower shift to +3 misses cases); has_prop detection works but propagation doesn't stop at non-bkg or handle min/max correctly in all cases; upper/lower switch at max_prop_i too rigid; is_plus1 logic for upper right prop buggy (not triggering when needed); lower_prop_rows hardcoded to first_clue_color but may need more conditions; global 5→bkg works but applied too early, missing some placements.
 * find_background helpful but fallback=3 fails when bkg=1/7/9; get_clue_color useful for group colors.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or connected components attempted—may be needed for verifying prop boundaries, but current code assumes horizontal fills only (unhelpful for vertical or shaped elements).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it retains many unprocessed 5's across rows (e.g., row 0 all 5's; rows 1-4 copy clue-like patterns with 5's and 0's unchanged; row 5 all 5's; rows 6-8 copy 2's and 3's but no 8's placed; rows 9-11 copy 9's and 3's; rows 12-18 mix 1's/9's/3's with some 8's in row 13 cols 8-9 but incomplete; rows 19-24 all 9's or mixed but no systematic 8 propagation or bkg fill).
 * Background not detected/filled (should be 3? based on fallback or uniform rows like row 5/0, but 5's remain everywhere); no seeds placed (clue_row=g[1] has 1 at col1, 3 at10,2 at13,4 at19—should trigger upper pairs at ~cols 2-3 (for1?), 8-9/14-15/20-21? but none appear).
 * Propagation absent (e.g., no 8's extended in potential prop rows; row 13 has isolated 8's but no left/right fill; lower rows like 19-21 have 9's but no right-fill from seeds if first_clue=1).
 * Output seems like a partial copy of input g[6:25] with minimal changes (only some 5→bkg? but many 5's persist; 0's unchanged, which may be invalid—puzzle likely requires full resolution to colors/8/bkg); does not match expected logic (e.g., should place 8 pairs in upper rows based on clues, prop in rows with original 8's like row 13?, fill bkg=3 in empties, preserve 2/9/1/4 blocks).
 * Likely issues: len(g)!=25 check failed or early return; clue parsing missed (0's in groups may skip activation); no has_prop rows detected (input has no original 8's?); upper_block_start not found properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 25x24 grid where the goal is to generate a modified 19-row output (rows 6-24 of the input) by detecting a background color, interpreting clues in row 1 to place pairs of "8" elements (representing seeds or props), and applying propagations to fill ranges of 8's based on rules for upper and lower blocks, while replacing 5's with background and handling special cases like right-fills and has-prop rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bkg) is determined by the most common non-0,5,8 value in rows 6+, defaulting to 3 if none; 5's are always replaced by bkg across the output.
 * Clues in row 1 are grouped in 4-cell blocks starting at columns 1,7,13,19; each group has a key color (first non-0/5 value) at a position (0-3) that dictates pair placement for 8's: e.g., position 0 with color 4/6 or (lower and 1) activates left-leaning pairs; position 3 with 2/4/6 activates right-leaning pairs; color 3 skips activation.
 * Upper pairs (for rows 0- max_prop_i in output indexing) are computed from all 4 groups (is_lower=False); lower pairs (for rows max_prop_i+1 to 18) use first group info and original 8-range if present.
 * Propagations: "has_prop" rows (any original 8) fill 8's across min-max 8 columns; right-fill propagates 8's from a start column to end in specific upper/lower blocks; upper block is initial all-bkg rows (up to 2 for right prop); lower prop starts at row 13/14 with 2 rows of fill/propagation based on first color (1/4 triggers pair, 1/2 triggers right-fill, else has-prop).
 * Subtleties: Pair starts/ends vary by color/position (e.g., color 1 pos0 -> start+3; color 2 pos3 -> start+3 but special for last group; color 4 pos0 checks next group's color for +3 vs +1); original 8-range is min-max columns with 8 in rows 6-24; max_prop_i is highest has_prop row index; rightmost upper pair determines if +1 offset for right_fill_start; lower left_fill_start from first pair or original min.
 * Easy to miss: First group handles color 1 specially for lower; lower prop num=2 but clipped to 19; pairs only placed if activated and color !=3; output copies input rows 6-24 then modifies; invalid input returns empty list.
 * Across attempts: No full successes; common issues include over-placing 8's in non-prop areas, missing full range fills (e.g., not expanding to connect 8's properly), incorrect pair positions based on clue logic, and failing to handle block transitions (upper to lower) or special fills (right/left).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = Counter()
    for row in grid[6:]:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in [0, 5, 8]:
                count[cell] += 1
    return max(count, key=count.get) if count else 3
```
(This correctly identifies bkg by frequency, excluding specials; useful for all cases.)

```python
def get_clue_color(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> int:
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val
    return 0
```
(Extracts key color per group; helpful for pair logic, especially cross-group checks like color 4 pos0.)

```python
def get_original_eight_range(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_col = 24
    max_col = -1
    for i in range(6, 25):
        row = grid[i]
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 8:
                min_col = min(min_col, j)
                max_col = max(max_col, j)
    return min_col, max_col if max_col >= 0 else (0, -1)
```
(Finds global min-max 8 columns for lower pairs/propagations; essential for cases with pre-existing 8's.)

```python
def find_has_prop_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    has_prop = []
    for i in range(19):
        row = grid[6 + i]
        if any(cell == 8 for cell in row):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Identifies rows needing has-prop fill; useful but needs integration with max_prop_i for block split.)

```python
def propagate_has_prop(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> List[int]:
    new_row = row[:]
    eight_cols = [j for j, cell in enumerate(new_row) if cell == 8]
    if not eight_cols:
        return new_row
    min_j = min(eight_cols)
    max_j = max(eight_cols)
    for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
        if new_row[j] == bkg:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```
(Fills gaps between min-max 8's in a row; core for has-prop, but unhelpful if applied too broadly without 8's present.)

```python
def is_all_bkg_row(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> bool:
    return all(cell == bkg for cell in row)
```
(Detects pure bkg rows for upper block end; helpful for limiting initial placements.)

The `compute_seed_pairs` and `get_first_group_info` functions are partially helpful for pair extraction but buggy (e.g., incomplete activation logic, special cases like gi=3 for color 2 mishandled); `place_seeds` is straightforward but overused without checks. Overall program structure (copy output, replace 5's, place then propagate) is a good skeleton but fails on block transitions and specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, bkg detection, and pair placement but fails all training examples due to incorrect propagations and pair positions.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8's in rows 7-8 (full middle fill too early) and row 9 (8's at 4-5 instead of connecting properly); missed full connection in row 7-8 (expected 0-3 as 1's unchanged, but placed 8's wrongly); lower rows 14-16 overfilled with 8's instead of partial; rows 16-18 correct for 2's but upper mismatches blob shapes (unknown why, possibly wrong upper_pairs or prop range).
 * Train 2: Generated wrong 8-range in row 2 (8's at 14-17 instead of 14-23 full); missed full 8-propagation in rows 2-3 (expected 8's to 23); row 5 has extra 8's at 16-17 where expected 1's; row 14 has 8's at 8-15 instead of none; row 15 partial 8's missing; lower rows 16-18 correct but upper prop fails to connect properly (e.g., row 8-9 should connect more).
 * Train 3: Generated wrong initial 8's in row 0-2 (3's at 8-17 instead of 8's? Wait, expected has 8's at 18-19 but generated 3's there initially?); rows 4-6 have 8's at 8-17 but expected full 0-4 8's in row 4; row 12 has 8's at 5-13 but expected none/more specific; row 13 overfills 8's at 5-13; row 14 partial but misses full 14-23 8's; lower row 16-18 has 7's at 3-4 instead of none, and 4's start too early without full prop.
 * Common misses: Over-placement of 8's in non-activated areas; incorrect block split (max_prop_i too low/high, leading to wrong upper/lower pairs); right-fill applied wrongly (e.g., starts too early or not at all); lower prop start/num hardcoded poorly (14 for 1/4 but affects fills); original 8-range not always used for lower pairs; has_prop applied universally instead of selectively.
 * Function `propagate_lower_prop_right_fill` is helpful for right-fills but unhelpful when misapplied (e.g., fills from wrong start, overfills empty rows).
 * Function `get_first_group_info` is broken for some colors (e.g., doesn't handle pos0 color=4/6 fully, leading to wrong lower pairs in Train 1/2).
 * Overall, attempt shows core structure but lacks precise clue-to-pair mapping and prop conditions; unhelpful to reuse raw `program` without fixes to activation and block logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an ERROR (invalid grid format: returned <class 'list'> instead of proper 19x24 List[List[int]]), indicating a crash likely from unhandled input dimensions, empty pairs, or index errors in propagation (e.g., pair_end >23 or max_prop_i invalid).
 * No generated grid to evaluate, but based on training failures, it would likely mismatch by over/under-placing 8's, wrong bkg replacement, or failed propagations (e.g., missing connections in has-prop rows or incorrect lower fills); does not look correct as it didn't produce output at all—must fix input validation and edge cases like no 8's or unusual clue colors to handle test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a 25-row by 24-column grid where rows 6-24 represent a drawable area with a background color, existing "8" elements (likely props or paint to propagate), and clues in upper rows (e.g., row 1) that dictate pair placements and fills of "8"s in upper (top ~half) and lower (bottom ~half) sections. The goal is to propagate and fill "8"s based on clue-derived rules for pairs, gaps, special connections, and background replacement, while preserving non-background elements like colored blocks (1-7,9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection: Scan rows 6-24, count non-0/5/8 cells, pick most common as background (default 3); replace all 5's with it. Subtle: Ignores 0/5/8 to avoid miscounting empties/props/specials, but may fail if background is rare or tied to clues.
 * Clue row parsing: Clues in row 1, divided into 4 groups of 4 cells (starts at indices 1,7,13,19). Each group has a "color" (non-0/5 value) and "position" (0-3 offset where color appears). Color=0 or 3 skips group; others trigger pair starts based on color/pos combos (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may depend on next group's color). Subtle: Last group (start 19) has edge case for pos=3/color=2 shifting to 18; pairs are always 2-wide (start to start+1), but computation varies (e.g., color 6 at pos 0 -> start+1; color 4 at pos 3 -> start+2).
 * Upper vs. lower sections: Upper is rows 0 to max_prop_i (index of last row with original 8's); lower is after. Place pairs as 8's only if the slot is all-background. Subtle: Upper uses multiple pairs from all groups; lower uses single pair from first group (with extra color=1 case at pos=0 -> start+3) or original 8-range if no special lower condition.
 * Original 8's range: Find min/max col with 8's in rows 6-24; used for lower fills if not special. Subtle: If no 8's, defaults to (24,-1) which skips.
 * Has_prop rows: Rows (0-18 relative) with any original 8; after placing pairs/seeds, fill gaps between min/max 8 in that row with 8's (connect blobs horizontally).
 * Special lower fills: For rows 14-15 (absolute 20-21?) if first group color in {1,2,4}, connect existing 8's to a target range (e.g., color=1 -> to col 23; color=2 -> from min_col to 23; color=4 -> from leftmost 8 to min_col). Subtle: Only if min_col <24 and 8's exist; applied after seeds but before/in gap fill? Order matters for connections.
 * Right fill upper: If upper pairs exist, find rightmost pair start; if it matches a computed group position and is at group_start+1, fill from that col to 24 with 8's—but only in the FIRST all-background row up to max_prop_i. Subtle: Only activates for specific cases (e.g., gi !=-1 and exact pos); seems to target a "spillover" but only once, which may miss multi-row propagation.
 * Propagation order: Replace 5's first -> compute pairs/ranges -> place seeds in upper/lower -> gap fill in has_prop rows -> special lower fills. Subtle: Gap fill only in has_prop (not all rows), and special lower overrides/reconnects based on color; no vertical propagation, only horizontal connects/fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty pairs/ranges skip; indices 0-23 cols; output is rows 6-24 modified. Subtle: Lower special skips if color not in [1,2,4]; background may be non-3 (e.g., 1 or 7 in examples); clues may have 0/5 as fillers.
 * General: Preserve non-bkg/non-8 (e.g., 1-4,6,7,9 blocks); no overwriting existing 8's; fills only on bkg slots.

```
(Helpful: Finds global 8-range for lower seeds; identifies rows needing gap fills. Essential for sectioning upper/lower and connecting.)

```python
def get_first_color(clue_row: List[int]) -> int:
    return get_group_info(clue_row, 1)[0]
```
(Helpful: Quick first-group color for special lower trigger.)

The pair computation functions (compute_upper_pairs, compute_lower_pair) are partially helpful for deriving 2-wide starts from clues but buggy (see below; overcomplicated logic misses cases). apply_right_fill_upper is unhelpful/broken (only fills one row, specific pos, doesn't propagate). Gap fill logic in main loop is helpful but limited to has_prop rows only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/only attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, background, and horizontal fills but fails all trainings due to incomplete propagation.
 * Train 1: Generated correctly places some upper pairs (e.g., 8,8 at cols 8-9 and 16-17 in early rows) and lower 2's/4's, detects bkg=3, but misses full connections in has_prop rows (e.g., row 7: generated has 8's only at 4-5? Wait, actually generated row7 [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,3,3] but expected starts 8's at col0; diff: generated delays left-fill until row8, and row11 has extra 3's vs expected 8's? Unknown why partial gap fill). Also, row12 generated has 8's at 0-1 but expected none there; special lower not triggering full right-fill in rows 14-16. Right fill didn't activate.
 * Train 2: Generated places upper pairs correctly in some rows (e.g., 8,8 at 4-5,8-9), bkg=1, but misses extending 8's in lower non-special rows (e.g., row3: generated 8's only partial vs expected full 13-23; row14: generated no 8's vs expected full connect). Lower pair computation wrong (places at wrong pos for color=6?). Special lower (rows16-18 with 4's) correct but upstream misses prevent full blobs. Gap fill skips non-has_prop or doesn't connect to min_col properly.
 * Train 3: Generated bkg=7 correctly, places some 8's (e.g., 3-4,18-19 pairs), but misses vertical consistency and full upper connects (e.g., row4: generated 8's at 8-9 but expected full 0-23 except edges; row5-6 similar partial). Has_prop gap fill incomplete (e.g., row11: generated connects some but leaves gaps at 8-17 vs expected full). Lower special not handled (rows16-18: generated 4's start at col8 but expected from col3; unknown pos miscalc). Right fill absent. Edge: row14 generated partial 8's vs expected more connects.
 * Overall: Pair logic over-relies on pos/color combos, missing spillover (e.g., color4 depending on next group often wrong). Gap fill only horizontal/per-row, no multi-row or full-section flood. Special lower misfires (wrong leftmost/to_col for colors). apply_right_fill_upper unhelpful (too narrow, only one row, didn't trigger in any train). No vertical propagation, leading to fragmented 8's. compute_lower_pair adds color=1 case but buggy (pos=0/1 overlap?). Program preserves colors well but under-fills 8's systematically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it seems to mishandle background (fills early rows 0-2 with 2's, but if bkg=3 at end, why 2's? Possible clue color leak or wrong bkg detect—clues may have 2's dominating count). Upper pairs/seeds partial (e.g., row7 has 8's at 8-10 but fragmented with 9's; expected smoother connects based on trains). Has_prop gap fill inconsistent (e.g., row13: 8's scattered with 9's gaps vs expected solid blobs). Lower special likely wrong (rows17-18: 4's at 7-15 but 8's/9's around; if first_color=4, should connect to min_col=3? but mixes with 9's). Ends with 9's, suggesting bkg=9 or un-replaced, but trains show preservation—output has too many isolated 8's and no full right-fills. Doesn't match train patterns (e.g., no solid lower 8-range); likely misses clue-dependent pairs and over-relies on original 8's which may be sparse. Unknown test clues/grid, but fragmented 8's/9's suggest broken pair computation or gap fill not extending to edges.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to generate a 19x24 output grid (rows 6-24 of the input) representing a support structure filled with 8s (beams or props) on a background color, based on clues in row 1 that dictate group-based pair placements, anchors from original 8s, propagation of fills, and special conditional rules for upper/lower sections, while replacing temporary 5s with background and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid is 25 rows by 24 columns; output must be exactly rows 6-24 (19 rows x 24 cols), with all non-8 cells set to the detected background color (most common non-0/5/8 value in output rows, defaulting to 3 if none).
 * Clue row (g[1]) is divided into 4 groups starting at columns 1,7,13,19 (each 4 cols wide); each group has a "color" (1-7, non-0/5) and "pos" (0-3 offset where color appears), which triggers specific pair placements (cols for 8-pairs) in upper (top half) or lower (bottom half) sections, with activations only for certain color-pos combos (e.g., color 1 pos 0 triggers lower pairs and left support at col 4-5; color 2/4/6 at pos 0 or 3 trigger upper pairs with offsets like +1, +3).
 * Anchor range is the min-max columns of original 8s in input rows 6-24; these must be filled with 8s across all output rows if background, but only in "has_prop" rows (those originally containing any 8).
 * Upper pairs apply to rows <= max_has_prop (upper block), lower pairs to rows > max_has_prop (lower block); special left support pairs (col 4-5) apply only to upper has_prop rows if color 1 pos 0.
 * Propagation: In has_prop rows, fill all background cells between min and max 8 positions with 8s (gap filling).
 * Special fills: If color 1 pos 0, fill cols 4+ to end with 8s in specific lower rows (14-15, 0-indexed in output); for upper right fill, if rightmost upper pair starts at group_start+1, fill cols from that start to end in the first 2 all-background upper rows.
 * Subtleties: Pairs only place if both cells are background (no overwrite); color 4 at pos 0 may skip next group if followed by color 2; background detection ignores 0/5/8; 5s are placeholders to replace with background before placing; has_prop rows are only those with original 8s, and max_prop_i is their max index (splits upper/lower); for last group (start 19), pos 3 color 2 adjusts pair_start to 18; empty groups (all 0/5) or color 3 skip pairs; propagation is per-row and only in has_prop rows; upper right fill requires detecting "plus1" starts and finding initial all-background block (may be 0-2 rows).
 * Edge cases: No original 8s means no anchors/propagation/max_prop_i=-1 (all upper pairs, no lower/left support); test input may have different dimensions or empty clues, causing format errors; overwrites must be avoided, but fills can expand existing 8s; lower right fill is narrow (only rows 14-15, cols 4+); upper block for right fill is prefix of all-background rows.

**Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `compute_lower_pairs`: Too simplistic; only handles color 1 pos 0 with fixed pair at 1+3=4, but misses broader lower rules (e.g., no pairs for other colors, and doesn't integrate with has_prop split properly; generated outputs show missing lower 8s in Train 2 rows 2-4, where expected has 8s at 13-23).
- `apply_lower_right_fill`: Hardcoded to rows 14-15 (output indices 8-9?) and cols 4+, but only if color 1 pos 0; broken for general cases, as Train 1 generated no such fill but expected subtle right 3s (not 8s); causes overfill or miss.
- `apply_upper_right_fill`: Complex but buggy; detects "plus1" but fills only first 2 all-bkg upper rows from rightmost pair start; in Train 1, it overfills right cols 22-23 with 8s in early rows (generated has 8,8 vs expected 3,3), and in Train 3, it doesn't trigger correctly, missing full right expansions.
- `place_seeds`: Attempts conditional placement but ignores full grid state; places anchors everywhere (even non-has_prop), causing overfill in lower blocks (e.g., Train 1 rows 16-18 have extra 8s in cols 4-15 where expected 2s/3s); also places pairs without checking has_prop boundaries properly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of clue parsing (groups, colors, pos) and background/anchor basics, but fails on conditional placements, propagation limits, and special fills, leading to all trainings incorrect.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8-pairs at cols 22-23 in rows 0-2,6-12 (vs expected 3,3 there, indicating overactive upper right fill or anchor expansion); rows 4-6 have 8,8 at 22-23 vs expected 3,3 or 4,4/3,3; rows 9-10 have 3,3 at 22-23 vs expected 3,3 (match) but earlier mismatches like row 8 has 4,4/3,3 vs 4,4/3,3 (partial match); row 12 has 3,3 at end vs 3,3 (match); lower rows 14-15 overfill cols 4-23 with 8s vs expected 8s only in anchor range; rows 16-18 have 2s starting at col 4 but expected same (match, but propagation missed gaps). Propagation works partially but applies anchors too broadly.
 * Train 2: Generated missing wide 8-fill in rows 2-4 cols 13-23 (has 1,1/1,1/1,1 vs expected 8s across, indicating failed lower pair or right fill trigger for color 6); row 14 has 8s cols 8-15 vs expected 8s cols 8-23 (underfill right); row 15 overfills cols 0-7 with 1s? Wait, generated 1s but expected 8s cols 0-23 partial; lower rows 16-18 match 4s but no 8-propagation into them. Upper pairs placed correctly for cols 4-5/8-9 but missed color 6 specifics (pair at 13?).
 * Train 3: Generated partial anchor fills but missed full expansions, e.g., rows 4-6 have 8s at 8-9/18-19 but expected wider 8s cols 0-7/16-19 in some; rows 11-12 have 8s cols 3-23 but expected 8s cols 3-19/6+; row 13 has 7s cols 0-2/20-23 vs expected 8s expansions; row 14 underfills cols 0-2/20-23; lower rows 16-18 have 4s cols 8-21 but expected 4s cols 8-21 with 7s edges (match but no prop). Color 2/6 triggers partial pairs but propagation doesn't connect to anchors fully; left groups (cols 0-3) have mismatched 7/2 vs expected 8 expansions.
 * Common issues: Over-placement of anchors/pairs outside has_prop (e.g., full grid anchors in Train 1 lower); incorrect upper/lower split (max_prop_i not limiting lower pairs properly, causing Train 2 underfill); special fills trigger wrongly (extra right 8s in Train 1, missing in Train 3); replace_fives works (no 5s remain) but background=3 assumed correctly; compute_upper_pairs misses skips (e.g., Train 1 color 4 pos? followed by 2?); no handling for empty has_prop (max_prop_i=-1 leads to all-upper, but Train 2 expects lower 8s).
 * get_group_info and find_background are solid (clues parsed right, bkg=3/1/7 matches inputs); place_pair is helpful but too permissive (no full conflict check beyond bkg).

**Test output:**
 * No valid generated output (ERROR: returned <class 'list'> instead of List[List[int]]); likely a bug in program() return (e.g., slicing g[6:25] fails if input !=25 rows, or empty output [] if dimensions wrong); this suggests the program assumes fixed 25x24 but test input may vary (e.g., smaller grid or non-list), causing crash—does not make sense as output, as it can't be verified; expected output unknown without rules run, but mentally: if test has unique clues (e.g., color 3 skips, or no 8s), output should be mostly bkg with minimal pairs/anchors; to fix, add dimension checks and return empty/fixed grid on error, but current crash indicates poor robustness for test case.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top rows (likely 0-5) represent an "above-ground" or sky area filled with background, and the content from lower rows (6+) is shifted up into a new grid. The number 8 represents a filling substance (e.g., "sand" or "growth") that originates from seed positions in the shifted content and expands vertically upward and horizontally sideways into background areas, but only in connected regions without crossing barriers (possibly number 5 acts as a barrier since it's skipped in copying). The goal is to produce a filled grid matching the expected patterns, where 8's propagate in a way that forms connected blobs, often widening horizontally at certain levels and filling "pockets" above the seeds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a fixed structure: 25 rows x 24 columns (based on output lengths), with background determined from g[6][0], suggesting row 6 is a reference for ground level or initial background.
 * Shifting: Content from rows 6+ of input g is copied to rows 0+ of output, but only non-5 values are preserved; 5's are treated as erasable or barriers (replaced with background), and top 6 rows of output are pure background— this works partially but leads to incomplete fills if expansion doesn't account for post-shift connections.
 * Seeds for 8's: Identified as positions with 8 in rows 6+ of input (shifted to 0+), collecting unique columns and the lowest (max row index) seed row; this identifies starting points but misses that expansion should connect across multiple seeds horizontally if they are at similar levels or via background.
 * Vertical expansion: Fills upward (from max_row +1 to top) only in exact seed columns if background—this is too narrow; expected outputs show 8's filling entire connected horizontal spans (e.g., widening to multiple columns) and propagating up through adjacent background cells, not just vertically in seeds.
 * Sideways expansion: Only at the specific lower_row (max seed row shifted), expanding left/right from min/max seed columns until non-background—this is limited to one row and doesn't propagate upward or connect blobs; expected shows horizontal fills at multiple rows (e.g., full-width 8's in some levels) and diagonal-ish connections.
 * Barriers and non-fills: 8's do not overwrite existing non-background numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 stay intact); only background is filled. Number 5 is skipped in initial copy, acting like a temporary barrier or void. Expansions stop at edges or other numbers. Subtle: Fills can "bridge" across background at various heights if connected to seeds via paths (e.g., in training 1, 8's extend right to col 16-17 in top rows, suggesting horizontal connectivity above seeds).
 * Connectivity: Likely requires flood-fill-like behavior (BFS/DFS from seeds upward and sideways through background only), not just linear expands— this is a key miss, as current code treats seeds independently without merging blobs. Also, fills may not go infinitely up (stops at top or barriers), and some expected patterns show 8's "hanging" or widening mid-grid.
 * Other elements: Existing shapes (e.g., 1's, 2's, 4's) remain but may get 8's filled around/above them; bottom rows in some examples have unchanged patterns (e.g., 2's in training 1). Grids may have multiple disconnected 8 blobs that need independent expansion. Easy to miss: Expansions can happen in "pockets" above barriers, and seeds might not be in every column, requiring horizontal spread before vertical.
 * All training examples failed due to under-filling: 8's didn't spread wide enough horizontally or connect across rows/columns as in expected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current functions provide a basic framework for shifting and seed detection but need enhancement for proper expansion (e.g., integrate flood fill).

```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[6][0]  # Helpful: Correctly identifies background from a fixed reference point.
```

```python
def shift_and_fill(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    out = [[background for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
    for i in range(18):  # Assumes h=24, shifts 18 rows (6+ to 24)
        for j in range(w):
            val = g[i + 6][j]
            if val != 5:
                out[i][j] = val
    return out  # Helpful: Basic shifting and 5-skipping works (preserves shapes), but top 6 rows are correctly background-filled; issue is post-shift expansion.
```

```python
def find_seed_columns_and_max_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    seed_cols = set()
    max_row = -1
    for i in range(6, h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] == 8:
                seed_cols.add(j)
                if i > max_row:
                    max_row = i
    return list(seed_cols), max_row - 6 if max_row >= 6 else -1  # Helpful: Accurately finds 8 seeds in lower input rows and computes shifted max row; useful for starting flood fill from these points.
```

The expansion functions (expand_vertical, expand_sideways) are broken/not helpful: They perform linear fills only in seed columns or at one row, missing connected region filling—do not reuse without major changes (e.g., replace with flood fill from all seeds).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single summarized attempt (the provided program); it partially understands shifting and seed detection but fails on expansion logic across all training examples.
 * Worked: Background detection is correct (matches all examples). Shifting copies non-5 content accurately (e.g., preserves 1's, 2's, 4's shapes in all trainings). Seed column collection identifies starting 8 positions correctly (e.g., cols 8-9 in training 1).
 * Didn't work: Vertical expansion too narrow (only seed cols, no horizontal connectivity upward), leading to thin 8 columns instead of wide blobs (e.g., training 1 generated 8's only in cols 8-9 top-to-mid, but expected has cols 4-5 + 8-9 + extensions to 16-17; training 2 misses cols 4-5 and wide row 2-3; training 3 misses left/right spreads from col 3-4 to wider 8's).
 * Sideways expansion limited to one row (lower_row), no propagation (e.g., training 1 generated no right extension to col 16-17 in top rows; expected connects horizontally at multiple levels. Training 2 generated no 8's in cols 4-5 or wide row 2; expected has them. Training 3 generated 8's only in cols 12-13 mid-grid, but expected has full rows 4-5 as 8's from col 0-11+).
 * Overall under-filling of 8's: Generated outputs have fewer/sparser 8's than expected (e.g., training 1: generated row 8 has 8's only cols 8-9 + some lower, expected has cols 4-17; row 12 generated no 8's in col 4-5, expected has them. Training 2: generated row 2 has 8's only cols 8-9, expected cols 4-5+8-9+14-21. Training 3: generated row 4 has 7's where expected has 8's in cols 0-3+12. Differences are consistent: lack of blob merging and upward horizontal spread).
 * No handling of multi-level connectivity or flood fill, causing isolated 8's (e.g., unknown why training 1 row 9-10 have 8's only in cols 4-5? Wait, generated has 3's there, expected 8's—likely missed vertical from adjacent seeds).
 * Function expand_vertical is unhelpful/broken: Linear per-column fill ignores horizontal neighbors (don't reuse).
 * Function expand_sideways is unhelpful/broken: Single-row expansion doesn't propagate (don't reuse).
 * find_seed_columns_and_max_row is essential/helpful: Reuse for seed detection, but expand from all seeds simultaneously via flood fill.
 * shift_and_fill is essential/helpful: Core shifting works, but ensure post-shift grid allows connected fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and shows misunderstanding of expansion rules. It has 8's only in cols 8-10 for top 3 rows (narrow, like failed vertical expand), then mostly 9's in mid-grid with isolated 8's in row 7 cols 8-10, and bottom rows with 2's and a partial 4's row (row 17 has 4's in cols 7-16, but shifted oddly). This mismatches likely expectations: Based on patterns, test input probably has seeds in lower parts (e.g., around cols 8+), requiring wide 8 fills upward into background pockets around 9's and 1's, connecting horizontally (e.g., full-width 8's mid-grid like training 3, or extensions around 9's blob). Instead, generated under-fills 8's (no wide spreads), leaves excessive 9's unfilled, and doesn't connect bottom 2's area—looks like incomplete shifting/expansion, similar to training failures (e.g., no bridging over 9's). Make sure to account for flood-filling connected background regions from all seeds upward/sideways to handle test case's probable large 9's structure and bottom 2's/4's.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 representing colors) where the top 6 rows appear to be a header or metadata, and the task is to extract and shift down the content below it, identify rectangular "panels" or blocks of uniform color (excluding background, 0, 5, 8), detect a special "maroon" (8) connector block, and then augment the layout by filling gaps and extending 8-colored borders to connect panels horizontally and vertically in a structured way, likely simulating comic panel borders or a unified strip.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background color (bg) is determined by the most common non-0/5/8 color in rows below y=6; this works but can miss if ties or edge cases occur.
 * Content blocks are only rectangles of uniform color c (1-9, excluding bg/0/5/8) larger than 4 cells, starting from the topmost row with that color; non-rectangular or small blobs are ignored, which is key but fails if blocks aren't perfectly rectangular or if detection misses partial overlaps.
 * Maroon (8) block detection expands from the first found 8 cell to its full rectangle; it's treated specially as a connector, but the code assumes only one and starts search from y=6, potentially missing if multiple or positioned oddly.
 * Output grid is the input height minus 6 rows, initialized to bg, with content blocks placed shifted up by 6 rows; this cropping and shifting is core but can clip blocks if they extend into the top 6.
 * Connections with 8: Horizontal fills in "connection rows" (where maroon overlaps after shift) between content edges and maroon; full vertical middle bar through maroon x-range; conditional left lower bar extension if content below on left; right upper bar if content above on right; bottom horizontal fill near lowest blocks, with height based on gap size (1 or 2 rows) and x-range adjusted by reach; upper right gap fills between stacked right-side blocks, limited by their heights and connection row.
 * Subtleties: 5 might be a special non-content/non-bg color (ignored in counts/blocks); connections only fill bg cells (not overwriting content); horizontal fills in connection rows set uniform x-start/end but code computes per row, leading to inconsistencies; bottom fill x-start uses left_bar if extended, else maroon start, and x-end checks if lowest blocks reach right; upper right fills only for blocks entirely right of maroon and above connection, filling from right_bar to edge but only in gaps; no overwriting of existing non-bg; assumes w is constant; potential issues with y_min=6 exactly or maroon not overlapping content vertically after shift.
 * Edge cases: No maroon (returns empty, no connections); no blocks (empty output); maroon above y=6 (clips); overlapping blocks (detection takes first topmost); small gaps (h=1 vs 2 for bottom); right-side stacks with varying heights; left/right extensions only if content "touches" bar x-range; all fills are 8-only, no other colors.

 * Train 1: Generated correctly shifted and placed blocks (1's left, 4's right, 2's bottom), detected bg=3 and maroon at x=8-9, but missed extending 8's rightward in upper connection rows (expected 8's at x=16-17 in rows 0-6); lower left 1's connected partially but no bottom horizontal 8's under gap; rows 9-11 have 8's only in maroon without left extension to x=4; rows 12-14 missing left 8's entirely; bottom 2's placed but no connection.
 * Train 2: Generated placed blocks (2's left, 3's right, 4's bottom, 6's mid-right) and maroon at x=8-9, bg=1, but missed left 8 extensions in rows 0-4 (expected at x=0-1); row 2 has extra 8's in right but overwrote or misfilled; connection rows (likely 5-9) have partial horizontals but no full upper right 8 bar in rows 14-15; bottom 4's isolated without connection.
 * Train 3: Generated bg=7, blocks (2's left, 3's top, 4's bottom, 6's right), maroon at x=12-13, but missed left 8 extensions in early rows (expected at x=0-1 in rows 0-3); row 4 has full 8's but overwrote 3's incorrectly; middle bar partial; lower extensions missing in rows 13-16 (expected more 8's under 7's); bottom 4's connected but x-range wrong (starts too left); upper fills incomplete.
 * Block detection generally works for rectangles but may miss if not starting exactly at topmost full row or if >4 size threshold excludes small panels.
 * Maroon detection finds block but expansion assumes horizontal then vertical, which fails if irregular shape.
 * Connection logic attempts horizontals per row but sets uniform h_start/h_end incorrectly (uses first row's, ignores variations); left/right bar conditions check overlap but use wrong y-ranges post-shift; bottom horizontal gap calc uses min_y but h=1/2 based on >4 arbitrary; upper right gap fill sorts blocks but fills only to w, may overfill or underfill heights.
 * place_content_blocks clips y but doesn't handle x clipping; create_output_grid initializes correctly.
 * Overall, core shifting and block placement works in parts, but connection fills are inconsistent (e.g., no rightward extensions in train 1/2, missing vertical bars in train 3); function find_maroon_block is helpful but returns empty on no 8, skipping connections; get_background_color ignores 8 correctly but may pick wrong if sparse.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on training patterns; it shifts content down by 6 (top 3 rows of 2's become rows 0-2, bottom 4's to rows 17-19, 9's and 1's placed), detects bg likely as 3 or 9? but fills much of the grid with 9's incorrectly (e.g., rows 3-6,9-16 mostly 9's where expected might be isolated blocks), maroon at x=8-9 extended vertically but horizontals overfill (e.g., row 7 full 8's from x=3-20, but training suggests only targeted fills); right side has 8's at x=19-20 in some rows but inconsistent with expected connections; bottom rows 17-19 have 4's but surrounded by 9's instead of connected 8's; upper right (rows 20-23) all 9's with 8's, likely misbg or overfill; lacks targeted gap fills (e.g., no bottom horizontal under 1's/9's to 4's); overall too much 9-overwrite and missing precise 8-bars, doesn't match structured connections from training expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming a 24x24 grid by detecting a background color, creating a large structural "maroon" (color 8) overlay in the upper portion, shifting non-background shapes upward from the lower part of the original grid into this structure (with some exclusions and adjustments to avoid overlaps), filling remaining spaces with the background color, and applying targeted overrides to certain areas like the top rows. The goal is to produce a new grid that integrates shifted elements into a patterned maroon frame-like structure while preserving specific visual motifs from the original.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The maroon (8) structure is not a solid full-row block from rows 0-15; instead, it's a patterned frame or segmented bars (e.g., pairs of 8s separated by background color in specific columns, like cols 8-9 and 16-17 in train1, or more complex interruptions in train3), which gets partially overridden by shifted shapes but retains key segments to form a consistent "end" or boundary motif across examples.
 * Shapes to shift are non-background and non-zero, but the exclusion of color 8 (maroon) and 5 (possibly a special marker or small element) in the current program prevents placing original maroon elements or certain accents, leading to missing 8s in expected positions; subtle rule may be to shift all non-background except perhaps only exclude 0 and true background, or handle 5/8 differently per shape.
 * Shifting is mostly upward by 6 rows from original rows 6+, but with a variable shift (5 for rows >=21) to handle bottom elements without overlap; however, this doesn't account for per-shape alignment or column-specific placements, causing misalignment (e.g., in train1, shifted 1s and 4s don't align with expected positions around the maroon bars).
 * Background detection samples from rows 6-23 and non-zero cells in col 24? (code has range(24), but intent may be edge sampling); this works for uniform bgs like 3 or 1 but may fail if bg varies or has patterns.
 * Top rows (0-2) need override of maroon back to bg only in areas not intended for structure, but current full-row override erases too much (e.g., in train1 expected, top 8s remain in specific cols); subtle: overrides should be selective, perhaps only where no shifted shape or structure is present, or propagate bg only in empty top areas.
 * Bottom rows (16+) seem to receive shifted elements correctly in some cases (e.g., the 2-bar in train1 rows 16-17 matches), but in others like train2, shifted 4s and 1s are misplaced or overfilled with bg.
 * Original grid has "small ones" or accents (e.g., color 5?) that may need special handling, like omission or separate shifting, as noted in code comments but not implemented effectively.
 * Overall, the transformation creates a "scroll" or "panel" effect: upper half gets a maroon frame with inserted shifted shapes, lower half gets remaining shifted elements on bg, but must match exact patterns without overfilling 8s or misaligning shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Maroon structures vary slightly per example (e.g., full-width in lower parts of train1 row14-15, but interrupted in train3), suggesting detection or hardcoding of frame based on bg or global rules; also, some expected 8s appear in shifted positions, implying original 8s should sometimes be shifted too.
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes a fixed large maroon block, which ignores per-example frame patterns; shifting excludes too much, leading to loss of structural 8s; fill_background after shifting is good but happens too late/early in sequence for overrides.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Samples non-zero pixels from lower-right area (rows 6-23, cols 0-23 effectively) to find dominant bg color; helpful for uniform bgs but may need expansion to full grid or edge detection for patterned bgs.
    pixels = [g[r][c] for r in range(6, 24) for c in range(24) if g[r][c] != 0]
    if not pixels:
        return 0
    return Counter(pixels).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def fill_background(new_g: List[List[int]], bg_color: int):
    # Fills all 0s with bg after placing structures/shifts; this is useful and correctly sequenced in the program, as it cleans up empties without overwriting placed elements.
    for r in range(24):
        for c in range(24):
            if new_g[r][c] == 0:
                new_g[r][c] = bg_color
```

```python
def place_top_override(new_g: List[List[int]], bg_color: int):
    # Overrides 8s to bg in top 3 rows; partially helpful for bg propagation but too broad—should be conditional on positions without structure or shifts to preserve expected 8 bars.
    for r in range(3):
        for c in range(24):
            if new_g[r][c] == 8:
                new_g[r][c] = bg_color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg color (e.g., 3 in train1, 1 in train2, 7 in train3) and partially shifts bottom shapes upward (e.g., the 2-bar in train1 rows16-17 and 4-bar in train2 rows17-18 land in reasonable positions without overlap).
 * Shifting logic works for avoiding bottom overlaps (variable shift 5/6) and excluding 0/bg, but fails by excluding all 5 and 8, causing loss of accent elements and failure to place original maroons into the structure (e.g., in train3, expected has shifted 8s in mid-grid, but generated has solid 8 blocks instead).
 * Large maroon placement as full rows 0-15 is incorrect—generates solid 8 blocks that get partially overridden, but expected has sparse, paired 8s (e.g., train1 top: 8s only in cols8-9/16-17 amid bg 3s; train2: similar pairs with 8s in shifted areas like row2 cols13-20).
 * Top override erases too many 8s, leading to full bg rows 0-2 in generated (vs. expected patterned 8s in train1/2/3 tops).
 * In train1: Generated has solid 8s in rows3-15 with left 1s overriding incorrectly (full left 4 cols as 1s in rows3-11, but expected has 1s only in row3 left, then 3s interrupting 8s); bottom 2s in rows17-18 match expected positions but row16 is wrong (full 3s vs. expected empty-ish).
 * In train2: Generated shifts 2s and 3s into solid 8s but misaligns (e.g., row5 2s start at col0 over 8s, but expected has them starting col0 with 8 interruptions); top rows have misplaced 1s/6s without patterns (row0-1 full 1s left/mid 6s, but expected has 8 pairs); bottom 4s in rows17-18 match but surrounded by wrong 1s.
 * In train3: Generated has solid 8s overriding everything, with 2s shifting to row7+ but not aligning (e.g., row7 2s at col0-2 over 8s, expected has them at col0-2 with 8s starting col3); top 7s/3s in row0-2 match bg but miss 8 pairs; bottom 4s in rows17-18 match positions but row16 has wrong 2s/7s.
 * place_shifted_shapes is mostly helpful for bulk shifting but broken for exclusions (skips 8/5, causing missing elements) and doesn't handle per-column or shape-specific adjustments.
 * place_large_maroon is unhelpful/broken: assumes uniform full-width 8s, but puzzle needs patterned 8 frames (e.g., detect or hardcode bar positions based on bg); don't use this as-is in future.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of shift+bg+override sequence but misses core patterned maroon rule, leading to all INCORRECT; no object extraction function present, which might help identify shapes for precise placement (e.g., detect bars and their cols).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it has full bg 2 rows 0-2 (but with right cols22-23 as 3, mismatched), solid 8 blocks in rows3-15 (overridden only by left 1s in rows6-12), and bottom shifts like 9s full in row16-18/20-23 with partial 4s in row18, but lacks any patterned 8 frames seen in training expecteds (e.g., no paired 8s separated by bg in top/mid).
 * It overfills 8s similarly to training fails, with shifts (1s from presumed original, 9s/4s bottom) misaligned—e.g., 1s only left in rows6-12 suggest incomplete shift exclusion, and row14-15 solid 8s vs. likely expected interruptions; bottom 9s seem like a wide shifted shape but dominate too much without bg interruptions.
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: misses the "frame" motif (e.g., expected likely has 8 bars in specific cols like 4-5/12-13 or similar, with 2/3 bg patterns integrated), and right-edge 3s in top suggest bg detection issue or unhandled original elements; to fix, need patterned 8 placement and inclusive shifting of certain colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes a 25x24 input grid (with clues in row 1 and a 19x24 working area starting from row 6) to output a completed 19x24 grid by identifying background colors, detecting and propagating special "8" elements (likely representing propagatable or filled areas), placing seed pairs of 8s based on clue groups in row 1, and applying conditional fills in upper/lower/right sections. The puzzle involves color-coded rules for activating and positioning pairs, handling "property" rows (those containing 8s), and ensuring background (bkg) cells are overwritten only under specific conditions, resembling a constrained paint-by-numbers or blob-filling puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bkg) is the most common non-0/5/8 color in the working grid (rows 6-24); 5s are always replaced by bkg early on, but 0s and 8s are preserved or used as seeds.
 * Clue row (g[1]) has 4 groups starting at columns 1,7,13,19 (each 4 cells wide); each group has a key color (first non-0/5 value) that determines activation and pair positioning—e.g., color 1 in lower context or 4/6 in pos 0 activates left-leaning pairs, 2/4/6 in pos 3 activates right-leaning pairs; color 3 is neutral/inactive.
 * Seed pairs are computed separately for "upper" (first 3 groups, max_group=3, is_lower=False) and "lower" (last group or subsets, max_group=1, is_lower=True); pairs are 2-cell adjacent 8s placed at specific offsets (e.g., +1, +2, +3 from group start) based on color/position, with special handling like pair_start=18 for last group if color=2.
 * "has_prop" rows are indices i (0-18 for output rows 0-18) where input row 6+i contains any 8; max_prop_i is the highest such i, dividing the grid into upper (0 to max_prop_i) and lower (max_prop_i+1 to 18) sections for pair placement—upper uses upper_pairs, lower uses lower_pairs; additionally, all has_prop rows get lower_pairs overlaid.
 * Propagation: In has_prop rows, fill all bkg cells between the min and max column with 8s (horizontal expansion); this must happen after initial placements but before some fills.
 * Upper right fill: Find the first all-bkg row (upper_block_start) from row 0; fill min(2, remaining rows) starting there, from the rightmost upper pair start to col 23 with 8s, but only if the rightmost pair is at group_start+1 (is_plus1=True).
 * Lower right fill: If first group color is 1 or 2, start fill at row 13 (for 2) or 14 (for 1), for 2 rows, from the leftmost lower pair start to col 23 with 8s.
 * Subtleties: Pair activation skips if color=3 or no key color; lower pairs may override upper in overlap; propagation can expand existing 8s but only fills bkg (not overwriting other colors like 1/2/4/6/7); all-bkg checks use temp_output to avoid interference from prior placements; grid must be exactly 19x24 output with valid ints (error if not); existing non-bkg colors (e.g., 1,2,4,6,7) in output are preserved and not overwritten by 8s.
 * Edge cases: No has_prop means max_prop_i=-1, so upper covers all; empty pairs skip placements; last group (col 19-22) has off-by-one adjustments (e.g., pair_end <24); if no count in bkg detection, default to 3.
 * Common misses: Over-propagating 8s into non-bkg areas; wrong pair offsets (e.g., assuming fixed positions); not separating upper/lower logic properly; fills applying unconditionally; failing to preserve existing colors like 1/2/4 in expected outputs.

            new_row[j] = 8

    return all(cell == bkg for cell in row)
```
(Helpful for finding upper_block_start; used with temp_output to avoid placement interference—key subtlety.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented core structure (bkg detection, pair computation, has_prop detection, propagation, sectioned placements, conditional fills) but all training examples failed due to incorrect 8 placements and expansions.
 * Train 1: Correctly placed some upper pairs (e.g., 8s at cols 8-9 and 16-17 in rows 0-6) and lower pairs (e.g., cols 2-3 in rows 12-14), but failed to propagate 8s into cols 4-7 in rows 7-8 (generated 3s, expected 8s); over-placed 8s in row 6 cols 16-17 (should be 3s); wrong lower fill starting too early (cols 18-21 got 4s but no right-fill 8s); row 12 has extra 8s at 2-3 (not expected); propagation missed in row 14 (cols 4-23 should be 8s but partial).
 * Train 2: Partially correct upper pairs (e.g., 8s at 4-5,8-9 in early rows), but wrong in row 2 cols 13-19 (generated 1/8s, expected 8s across); lower section misplacements (e.g., row 10 has 8s at 4-15 but expected 1s at 4-7); row 12 has extra 8s at 0-3/20-23 (expected 1s); propagation failed in row 14 (cols 8-23 should be 8s); lower fill in rows 16-18 placed 8 at col 5 incorrectly (expected 1s there).
 * Train 3: Good initial pairs (e.g., 8s at 3-4,18-19 in rows 0-3), but failed upper propagation (rows 4-6 should have 8s at 8-17 but generated 7s/8s mismatched); row 6 has extra 8s at 0-3 (expected 7s); row 11 has 8s at 5-17 (expected partial); lower fill in rows 16-18 placed 8 at col 3 (expected 7); propagation in row 14 missed expanding to cols 20-23.
 * Pair logic worked partially (some expected 8 pairs match, like in train1 cols 8-9), but activation/offset rules are buggy (e.g., color=4 with next=2 not triggering +3 correctly; lower color=1 not always +3).
 * Section division via max_prop_i is helpful but misapplied—upper/lower placements overlap incorrectly, and has_prop overlay adds extras without checks.
 * Fills are over-aggressive: upper right applies even without is_plus1 in some cases; lower right uses wrong left_start (min pair instead of fixed).
 * Propagation is applied only to has_prop rows post-placement, but timing causes misses (e.g., needs re-propagation after fills?); doesn't handle vertical propagation.
 * Overall, preserves existing colors correctly (e.g., 1/2/4/6/7 not overwritten), but 8s overwrite bkg too selectively.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, though compute_seed_pairs has subtle bugs in offsets (e.g., for color=2 at end).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output provided—program errored with invalid format (<class 'list'>, likely returned [] or non-List[List[int]] due to early return if len(g)!=25 or len(g[0])!=24, suggesting test input didn't match expected dimensions).
 * Without output, cannot verify correctness, but based on training failures, it likely would mismatch: partial pairs/fills/propagation as seen in trains, potentially missing test-specific clues (e.g., unique color_pos or no has_prop). Test probably requires robust dimension check and default handling; error indicates lack of graceful fallbacks, making output unusable—does not look correct due to crash.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top rows define active colors and patterns, and the task is to transform the lower "base field" (rows 5-23) by identifying maroon (8) patches, extending them horizontally and vertically into pillars, filling connections between pillars while respecting active colors, clearing non-maroon elements below patches, and adding full horizontal connections in background areas to link to the bottom, ultimately outputting the first 19 rows of the modified grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The base field is always the lower 19 rows (g[5:24]), with borders (5's) replaced by background (3's) to simplify processing.
 * Active colors are unique non-0, non-5 values from rows 1-4 of the input grid; these must not be overwritten except where explicitly filling with 8's, and fills only occur on background (3) or non-active cells.
 * Maroon patches are contiguous horizontal sequences of 8's in the base field; the code assumes a single patch but should handle multiples via patch_infos list—subtlety: patches may shift after horizontal fills, so compute pillar positions post-fill.
 * Horizontal fills extend 8's left/right from each patch until hitting an active color or edge, but only at the patch row itself.
 * Pillars: Upper pillars (above patch) include left pillar (aligned to extended left), patch pillar, and right pillar (aligned to extended right); for the row immediately above the patch, add a full fill between the outermost pillars if background. Lower pillars (below patch) only include left and patch pillars, without right or full fills, and extend down fully.
 * Clearing below patch: Starting from the row after the patch, replace all active colors (except 8's) with 3's to remove obstructions, but preserve any existing 8's or background.
 * Full connections below: In rows sufficiently below the patch (e.g., after 2-3 pillar rows), if a row segment from left pillar start to near-right edge is all background (3's), fill it entirely with 8's to create horizontal links; leave space at bottom edges and avoid overfilling near active areas.
 * Subtle elements: Pillar widths must match the original patch width for alignment (e.g., right_pillar_left = right_end - patch_width + 1); upper fills may need to handle varying active interferences per row; lower sections often end with pattern-specific bars or fills (e.g., full 8 rows or color bars) that aren't cleared/overwritten; multiple patches require independent processing without interference; the output must exactly match expected row-by-row, including preserving top patterns like 1's, 2's, 4's in specific positions.
 * Edge cases: Patches may be off-center; active colors in lower rows block fills but aren't cleared until after pillar application; bottom 2-3 rows often preserve input patterns (e.g., color bars) without 8 fills; if no patches, return unmodified base field (but all examples have patches).
 * General: Grid width is 24 columns; deepcopy to avoid mutating input; process upper/lower separately after horizontal fills; avoid filling active colors or beyond grid edges.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and extracts the base field, replaces 5's with 3's, and gets active colors from top rows, which works across all examples as a solid foundation.
 * Horizontal fills at patch rows are mostly correct (e.g., extends 8's properly in train 1 and 2), but in train 3, it overextends or misaligns due to pre-existing actives like 7's blocking partially.
 * Pillar computation post-fill is helpful but buggy: in train 1, it sets left_pillar incorrectly, leading to no left pillar in upper rows (generated has empty left in rows 0-3, but expected has 1's preserved and no extra 8's there); upper pillars apply patch and right but miss full left+fill in immediate above row, resulting in row 4 having 1's instead of full 8's connection.
 * Lower pillars in train 1 apply left and patch correctly but fail to preserve expected 1's in rows 9-11 (generated clears to 3's and adds unnecessary 8's in right, but expected keeps 1's and shifts to 3's/4's); clearing active below works partially but over-clears preserved patterns like the 1's bar.
 * In train 2, upper pillars overfill row 0 with 1's into 8's (generated row 0 has 1's overwritten, but expected preserves them); horizontal fills miss the full right extension in rows 2-3 (generated has partial 8's, expected full 8's across right); lower clearing removes too much, turning expected 1's/3's into 8's in rows 12-16, and full connections below are absent or mistimed (no full 8's in rows 14-15 as expected).
 * Train 3 generated mismatches heavily: upper rows 0-3 have 7's preserved but no 8 extensions into them (expected has 8's starting row 0); patch at row 4-7 fills incorrectly, adding extra 8's in left/right where 7's should block; lower pillars extend wrong (e.g., row 8 has 2's overwritten partially, expected preserves 2's left); full connections below are missing (rows 14-16 should have more 8's connecting 7's, but generated has gaps); bottom rows 17-18 clear 4's incorrectly to 3's/8's, but expected keeps 4's bar.
 * add_full_connections_below is unhelpful/broken: arbitrary start_r= patch_r+3 and checks only partial width (left_start to width-3), leading to no fills in train 1 (expected full 8's in row 14), partial in train 2, and none in train 3; it ignores active interferences and bottom preservation.
 * clear_active_below_patch over-applies, removing expected active patterns below (e.g., 1's in train 1 row 9-11, 1's in train 2 rows 12-18, 7's/4's in train 3 rows 16-18); it should skip certain bottom rows or only clear non-connector actives.
 * apply_upper_pillars has logic for immediate above full fill but miscalculates min_fill/max_fill bounds (e.g., in train 1, it fills too narrowly, missing connection to 4's); it also applies to all upper rows including where actives like 1's block, but doesn't preserve them properly.
 * apply_lower_pillars misses right pillar in some cases and doesn't handle multiple patches; in train 2, it adds extra 8's in row 16-17 where expected has 1's/4's.
 * Overall, the single-patch assumption works for these but may fail multiples; deepcopy is good but excessive copies slow it; no handling for patch row variations (e.g., train 1 patch at row 7, train 2 at row 3, train 3 at row 0? wait, base indexing).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it starts with a top row of partial 8's but then has full 2's bars in rows 1-3 (likely from uncleared input patterns), which shouldn't be overwritten unless part of pillars, but expected likely needs 8 extensions into them based on patch at row 4.
 * Rows 4-6 show 9's preserved around central 8's patch, but horizontal fills seem incomplete (no extension left/right beyond 9's, whereas expected should fill to edges or actives); upper pillars in row 7-8 incorrectly overwrite 1's/9's with 8's without full connection.
 * Lower sections (rows 9-18) have repetitive 8's pillars but overextend into 9's areas without blocking, and row 18 has a weird partial 8's/3's mix with 9's, suggesting clearing failed to remove actives properly while missing full horizontal connections below (expected probably has full 8's links in background rows and preserves bottom 9's bar).
 * No full connections added below (e.g., rows 14-17 are pillar-only, but test likely needs horizontal 8's in all-3 segments to connect to bottom 9's); the output ignores active 9's blocking, leading to overfills, and bottom row 18 doesn't match typical bar preservation seen in training (e.g., no clean 9's bar).
 * Overall, it partially captures pillars but fails on preservation, blocking, and connections, making it incoherent compared to training expectations—e.g., too many 8's in right columns without justification, and missing upper connections.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle involving a 25x24 input grid (with clues in early rows) where the goal is to process and modify the lower 19 rows of a scene by detecting background colors, interpreting clue groups to place or extend "8" values (likely representing props, fills, or extensions), handling special pairing rules for upper and lower sections, and applying propagation rules like vertical/horizontal extensions and fills based on prop positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection: Identify the most common non-special (non-0,5,8) value in the output grid as background (bkg), then replace all 5's with it; this works but may fail if ties or special cases alter counts.
 * Clue interpretation: Clues in row 1 are divided into 4 groups of 4 cells (starts at 1,7,13,19); extract color (first non-0/5 value) and position (offset 0-3) per group using get_group_info; colors like 1-6 trigger specific activations for pairs or fills, with skips for certain combinations (e.g., color 4 with next 2 skips next group).
 * Upper pairs: For rows 0 to max_prop_row (where props=8 exist), place horizontal pairs of 8's in bkg areas based on clue activations (e.g., pos=0 with color 4/6 starts pair at +1 or +3; pos=3 with 2/4/6 adjusts start); includes skip logic for chained activations.
 * Lower pairs/special: For rows 16+ or prop rows, similar but limited (e.g., only for first group color=1 at pos=0 or color=4 at pos=3); special handling if first color=1/2 for left-to-right fills in rows 14-15 starting from min pair/col positions.
 * Prop propagation: For each column with original 8's, extend 8's upward from min_row and downward from max_row into adjacent bkg cells until non-bkg; also horizontal fill between min/max 8-cols in prop rows and specific rows (14,15).
 * Rightmost upper block fill: If rightmost upper pair starts at group_start+1, find first all-bkg upper row and fill rightward from pair start for up to 2 rows.
 * Subtleties: Max_prop_i limits upper fills to before last prop row; orig_min/max_row track original 8 positions before modifications; horizontal fills only in bkg gaps within 8-col ranges; potential overfill in chains (e.g., color 4+next2 skips but still pairs); lower fills start from 16 but may apply earlier in prop rows; entire rows 14-15 get rightward fills if first color=1/2, but only from left_fill_start.
 * Easy to miss: Pair positions must be <24 and +1 valid; for last group (start=19), pos=3 pair_start=18; vertical extensions stop at non-bkg; background count excludes 0/5/8 but defaults to 3 if empty; prop rows (with any 8) trigger extra horizontal fills.
 * Grid format: Output must be exactly 19x24 List[List[int]], no errors; input validation checks len(g)=25 and len(row)=24.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = Counter()
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in [0, 5, 8]:
                count[cell] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 3
```
(This reliably detects bkg; useful for replacing 5's and checking empty areas for fills.)

```python
def get_group_info(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val, p
    return 0, -1

def get_clue_color(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> int:
    return get_group_info(clue_row, group_start)[0]
```
(These extract per-group color/pos from clues; essential for all activations; handles 0/5 as skips.)

```python
def get_has_prop_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    has_prop = []
    for i in range(19):
        if any(cell == 8 for cell in grid[6 + i]):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop
```
(Identifies rows with original props=8; key for limiting upper fills and triggering specials; max() gives boundary.)

            if color in [4, 6]:
                activate = True
                if color == 6:
                    pair_start = start + 1

                    if next_c == 2:
                        pair_start = start + 3
                        skip_next = True
                    else:
                        pair_start = start + 1
        elif pos == 3:
            if color in [2, 4, 6]:
                activate = True
                if color == 2:
                    pair_start = start + 3
                    if start == 19:
                        pair_start = 18
                elif color == 4:
                    pair_start = start + 2
                    skip_next = True
                elif color == 6:
                    pair_start = start + 1
        if activate and pair_start != -1 and pair_start + 1 < 24:
            pairs.append((pair_start, pair_start + 1))
    return pairs
```
(This computes upper pair positions with skip logic; partially works but misses some activations or placements.)

```python
# Vertical/horizontal extension logic (from main program)
orig_min_row = {j: 19 for j in range(24)}
orig_max_row = {j: -1 for j in range(24)}
for i in range(19):
    for j in range(24):
        if g[6 + i][j] == 8:  # Original props
            orig_min_row[j] = min(orig_min_row[j], i)
            orig_max_row[j] = max(orig_max_row[j], i)
for j in range(24):
    if orig_max_row[j] >= 0:
        min_i = orig_min_row[j]
        for k in range(min_i - 1, -1, -1):
            if output[k][j] == bkg:
                output[k][j] = 8
            else:
                break
        max_i = orig_max_row[j]
        for k in range(max_i + 1, 19):
            if output[k][j] == bkg:
                output[k][j] = 8
            else:
                break
```
(This tracks original 8 positions and extends vertically into bkg; helpful for propagation but applied too late or without originals preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1: Fully correct, indicating core background replacement, basic pair placement in upper rows, and some extensions work well for simple cases.
 * Train 2: Incorrect; generated misses rightward 8-fills in rows 2-3 (positions 16-23 should be 8's but are 1's/bkg); row 4 has correct partial but expected has more 8's in 16-23? No, row 4 matches expected in provided snippet, but row 2-3 differ (generated has isolated 8-pairs without full row fill); lower rows 14-15 have correct 8-fills, but upper prop extensions incomplete; likely upper pair logic or block fill misses chaining to full rows.
 * Train 2: Rows 0-1 match expected (6's in 13-17); but rows 2-4 show partial pairs (e.g., 13-15 as 1's in generated row 2 vs 8's in expected); horizontal fills in prop rows (e.g., row 8-9) match, but vertical upward from props doesn't fully propagate to upper empty areas.
 * Train 3: Incorrect; major differences in upper-mid rows—e.g., row 4 generated has 7's in 0-7/15-17 where expected has full 8's across 0-14; row 5-6 generated has isolated 7's vs expected full 8's in 0-14; row 14 generated has 7's in 15-19 vs expected 7's only partial; suggests upper pair activations or bkg checks fail, leading to no fills in wide areas; lower rows 16-18 match expected 4's and 7's.
 * Train 3: Row 0-2 match; row 3 partial (20-23=7's vs 6's? No, expected row 3 has 6's in 20-23, generated matches); but row 4-6 over-rely on bkg without placing wide 8-blocks from clues; horizontal fills in row 7+ partial but miss left extensions; vertical extensions apply but don't cover full widths.
 * General: compute_lower_pairs and special lower_pair_for_special partially work (e.g., Train 2 rows 16+ correct), but range for lower fills is wrong (hardcoded 16 to 16? Typo in code: range(max_prop_i +1 if ... else 16, 16) is empty); upper_pairs_with_skip handles skips but misses some pos=0/3 cases or rightmost adjustments; rightmost block fill activates but num_rows= min(2, ...) may underfill; first_color=1/2 left_fill_start min() works but overfills if orig_min_col wrong; orig_min/max_row computed before some fills, so misses propagated 8's; prop row horizontal fills apply but only after pairs, causing gaps.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The lower_pairs range loop is broken (range(a,16) with a>=16 does nothing); upper block fill assumes max_prop_i but may not find upper_block_start correctly if no all-bkg row; entire program returns output but test errors on format (likely due to g[6:25] slicing if input invalid, or empty return on len check).

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an ERROR: "Program returned invalid grid format: <class 'list'>", indicating the function returned a flat list instead of List[List[int]]; this suggests a bug in output construction (e.g., slicing g[6:25] failed or row[:] copied wrong, or early return [] flattened somehow).
 * No actual grid generated, so cannot verify correctness; likely the input grid doesn't meet len=25x24, triggering empty return, but error message implies type mismatch rather than empty—program understanding is incomplete for edge cases like invalid inputs.
 * Without output, it doesn't make sense; fix validation/output copy first, then check if pairs/fills apply similarly to trains (e.g., expect bkg replacements and 8-extensions based on clues, but unknown without test input details).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input result: ERROR - Program returned invalid grid format: <class 'list'>
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 00:46:25] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a logic puzzle involving a 25-row by 24-column grid (with the output being a processed 19x24 subgrid from rows 6-24), where a clue row (row 1) encodes rules for placing "pillars" (filled with 8's) in specific columns, propagating them vertically and horizontally based on existing 8's (which indicate propagation zones), and filling regions to the right in certain cases. The goal is to deduce and apply these placements over a background color (most common non-special value), replacing 5's (likely placeholders) with background, while respecting group-based clues in the clue row divided into 4-cell groups starting at columns 1,7,13,19.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses numbers 0 (empty?), 5 (replaceable placeholder to background), 8 (pillar/fill indicator that propagates), and 1-7 (colors/regions); background is the most frequent non-0/5/8 value, defaulting to 3 if none.
 * Clue row groups (4 cells each at starts [1,7,13,19]) determine "pairs" of columns for pillars: activation based on non-0/5 color position (0 or 3 preferred) and value (e.g., 4/6 at pos 0 or 2/4/6 at pos 3 trigger pairs; special handling for adjacent groups like skipping or linking if next group has color 2).
 * Existing 8's in the 19x24 subgrid define "has_prop" rows (any 8 triggers horizontal propagation within pillar column bounds in that row) and original pillar columns (all columns with any 8, which get full vertical pillars).
 * Upper pillars (from clue pairs) fill from row 0 down to max_has_prop_row; lower pillars fill from max_has_prop_row+1 to bottom.
 * Subtleties: Pair starts vary by color/pos (e.g., color 6 at pos 0 -> start+1; color 4 at pos 0 may link to next group if next is 2, setting start+3 and skipping next; for last group pos 3 color 2, adjust to 18). Horizontal propagation only in has_prop rows, between min/max pillar columns. Right-fills: For upper-right, if rightmost pair is at group_start+1, fill 1-2 empty (all 0/bkg) rows starting from first such row up to max_prop, from pair_start to col 23 with 8's—but only if condition met, using temp grid copy from original. For lower-bottom, if first clue color is 1 (1 row) or 2 (2 rows), fill bottommost empty lower rows (all 0/bkg/8) from min pillar/orig col to 23 with 8's.
 * Easy to miss: max_prop_i is max has_prop index (0-18), or -1 if none; pillars overwrite only 0/bkg (preserve existing colors like 1/2/4/6/7). compute_upper_pairs_with_gi tracks group index (gi) for right-fill logic; lower pairs don't need gi. Pair validation: pair_start +1 <24. In lower fill, start_col depends on first color (pillar min for 1, orig min for 2). Temp grid in upper_right_fill checks original state before placements for "empty" detection. All fills are with 8's, but existing non-0/bkg cells (e.g., colors) are preserved.
 * Across attempts: Background detection/replacement works but may not handle all cases (e.g., if 8's skew counts). Pair computation has bugs (e.g., lower pairs limited to max_group=0, missing later groups; upper pairs skip logic inconsistent). Propagation misses vertical full-fills in some orig cols or horizontal bounds. Right-fills overfill/underfill (e.g., wrong row counts or starting points; temp grid deepcopy may fail if original_g altered). Error in test: Program returns list but invalid format (likely wrong dimensions or non-list-of-lists).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter
import copy

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = Counter()
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell not in [0, 5, 8]:
                count[cell] += 1
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0] if count else 3
```
(Detects background color reliably from non-special cells.)

```python
def replace_fives(grid: List[List[int]], bkg: int) -> None:
    for row in grid:
        for j in range(len(row)):
            if row[j] == 5:
                row[j] = bkg
```
(Preprocesses placeholders; modifies in-place, useful early.)

```python
def get_has_prop_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    has_prop = []
    for i in range(19):
        if any(cell == 8 for cell in g[6 + i]):
            has_prop.append(i)
    return has_prop

def get_original_eight_columns(g: List[List[int]]) -> set:
    cols = set()
    for i in range(19):
        for j in range(24):
            if g[6 + i][j] == 8:
                cols.add(j)
    return cols
```
(Extracts propagation rows and original pillar columns; essential for bounds and vertical fills.)

```python
def get_group_info(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    for p in range(4):
        val = clue_row[group_start + p]
        if val not in [0, 5]:
            return val, p
    return 0, -1

def get_clue_color(clue_row: List[int], group_start: int) -> int:
    return get_group_info(clue_row, group_start)[0]
```

(These handle vertical pillar placement and horizontal propagation correctly in principle, but order matters—call after pair computation, before fills; overwrite only 0/bkg to preserve colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of pair computation, propagation bounds, and fill rules; test input crashed with invalid format (likely due to early return [] if dimensions mismatch, or deepcopy/copy issues in apply_upper_right_fill).
 * Train 1: Generated overfilled pillars in rows 9-11 (cols 4-7 as 3's instead of 8's; expected 8's there for horizontal prop), underfilled row 12 (cols 0-1 as 1's instead of 8's? Wait, expected has 8's in cols 4-5 but generated 3's in some; row 13-14 cols 0-3 as 3's instead of 8's; row 15 full 8's but expected partial; bottom rows have 8's in cols 2-3 where expected 3's). Differences suggest missed horizontal prop in non-full has_prop rows and wrong min/max pillar (included too many cols like 0-3). Upper right fill likely over-applied, turning expected 3's to 8's in row 15.
 * Train 2: Generated mismatched colors/pillars, e.g., row 10 cols 0-3 as 8's instead of 1's (overfilled upper pillars into color region); row 11 cols 4-5 as 8's instead of 1's; row 12 cols 0-3 as 1's instead of 8's? Expected has 1's there but generated 1's too—wait, row 12 generated 1's in 0-3, expected 1's; but row 14 cols 0-3 as 1's instead of 8's (underfilled orig pillars); bottom fill in rows 16-18 cols 5-12 as 8's? No, generated 4's but expected 4's—wait, differences in row 10-11 (generated 8's in cols 0-3/4-5 where expected 1's/8's mixed); row 12 cols 4-5 as 8's instead of 1's. Seems lower pairs wrong (max_group=0 limits to first group, missing later activations); upper pairs overfilled vertically past max_prop.
 * Train 3: Generated underfilled upper pillars, e.g., rows 4-6 cols 0-2/8-17 as 7's/3's instead of 8's (expected full 8's in row 4 cols 0-7? No, expected row 4 cols 0-2 7's, but row 5 cols 0-7/12-13/19-20 as 8's where generated 7's/8's partial); row 14 cols 5-19 as 7's instead of 8's (missed horizontal in has_prop row); bottom rows 16-18 cols 0-2 as 2's, 3-23 partial 4's/7's but expected 7's in col 0 then 4's from col 8, with col 3 as 7's not 8's. Pair linking/skipping buggy (e.g., color 4 with next 2 not handled for upper); lower fill start_col wrong (used pillar min instead of orig for color 2?); propagation didn't full-fill orig cols vertically.
 * compute_upper_pairs_with_gi is partially helpful but buggy (inconsistent pos==0/3 logic for pair_start, e.g., color 4 at pos 0 sets pair_start=start+1 if no link, but skips only if link; gi tracking good for right-fill). compute_lower_pairs calls compute_seed_pairs with max_group=0, which is broken (only processes first group, missing activations in later groups like gi=2/3; don't use as-is). apply_upper_right_fill uses deepcopy of original_g[6:25] for temp check, helpful for "empty" detection, but condition (pair_start == group_start+1) too strict and num_fill min(2, rows) may over/under; also, fills with 8's but only if all-bkg row found—useful but crashes if no original_g passed correctly. apply_lower_bottom_fill good for bottom empty detection (sort reverse for bottommost), but start_col logic (min pillar for 1, orig for 2) and num_rows (1 for 1, 2 for 2) not triggering right (e.g., first_color detection assumes get_clue_color(1) but may miss if pos!=0). Overall, main program structure (output = copy g[6:25], bkg, replace, compute pairs/cols, place pillars/prop, then fills) is helpful but order wrong (fills use post-placement grid, but temp uses pre—fix by calling fills after prop but adjust temp). Function compute_seed_pairs is unhelpful/broken for lower (wrong params; generalize but fix max_group to 4).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output provided (ERROR: invalid grid format, likely [] returned due to len(g)!=25 or len(g[0])!=24 check failing, or deepcopy/copy error in apply_upper_right_fill returning non-list-of-lists). This does not make sense or look correct—program should always return a valid 19x24 list-of-lists, even if empty placements. Without output, can't verify, but error suggests dimension handling broken (e.g., test input may not be exactly 25x24, or g[6:25] slicing fails). To handle test, relax input check (assume valid), ensure all functions modify/output in-place correctly, and add try-except for deepcopy; expected output likely similar to trains: partial 8 pillars from clues/orig, horizontal in has_prop rows, right-fills in specific empty zones preserving colors like 1/2/4/6/7.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 00:46:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 01:13:18] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where starting points (indicated by specific colors in a pattern row) need to be connected to target regions (blobs or blocks of matching colors) in the main puzzle area using a consistent connector color (likely 8, representing paths or wires). The connections appear to form thick (width 2) vertical paths from the top down to the target's level, followed by horizontal connections across the target, but only overwriting background cells, with the goal of matching exact expected grid outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid has a structured layout: rows 0-5 seem to be headers/borders (e.g., row 1 is the pattern row for starts), main puzzle is rows 6-24 (19 rows), and the output should modify only the main area while preserving non-background cells.
 * Background is the most common color in the main grid (often 3 or 1 across examples), and paths (color 8) should only overwrite background cells, never existing objects or targets.
 * Starts are parsed from row 1 (g[1]): non-zero, non-5 values indicate (column, target_color) pairs; multiple starts may exist, each needing independent connections.
 * Targets are bounding boxes of cells matching the start's target_color; if not found, skip. Connections are vertical (thickness 2, in start column s and s+1) from row 0 down to the target's max_r (bottom row), then a single horizontal line at max_r across the target's min_c to max_c.
 * Subtle elements: Vertical paths start from the top (row 0) but may need to stop or adjust at the target's top if overlapping; thickness is always 2 columns wide, but if s+1 exceeds width, it falls back to s (potential edge case bug). Horizontals are only at the bottom of the target, not the top or sides. Paths do not extend below the target or connect multiple targets incorrectly. Existing structures (e.g., blocks of 1,2,4) must remain unchanged except where background is filled. In some cases, verticals appear to "hug" the left or right of targets, and horizontals may need to extend beyond the bounding box or connect at different rows. Overfilling (e.g., painting over non-background) or wrong column selection breaks matches. Edge cases: targets spanning full height/width, multiple overlapping starts/targets, or backgrounds varying per example (3 in ex1, 1 in ex2/ex3/test). No diagonal or curved paths—strictly axis-aligned. Preserve all non-path elements exactly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def extract_main_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Correctly extracts the main 19x? puzzle area (rows 6:25), returns a mutable copy for modifications.
    return [row[:] for row in g[6:25]]
```

```python
def find_background(main: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Accurately identifies background as the most common color via flattening and Counter.
    if not main:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in main for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def parse_starts(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Parses row 1 correctly for starts: (col, color) where color not in [0,5].
    pattern = g[1]
    w = len(pattern)
    starts = []
    i = 0
    while i < w:
        if pattern[i] not in [0, 5]:
            starts.append((i, pattern[i]))
        i += 1
    return starts
```

```python
def find_target_box(main: List[List[int]], target_color: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    # Efficiently finds target's bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) using flat loop; returns invalid if not found (e.g., max_r=-1).
    h = len(main)
    w = len(main[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    min_r = h
    max_r = -1
    min_c = w
    max_c = -1
    for i in range(h * w):
        r = i // w
        c = i % w
        if main[r][c] == target_color:
            min_r = min(min_r, r)
            max_r = max(max_r, r)
            min_c = min(min_c, c)
            max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `fill_vertical` and `fill_horizontal`: These implement the filling logic but are buggy—vertical fill uses a strided loop (k * w) which works but overfills if not clipped properly; horizontal is row-contiguous but both fail to handle cases where paths should stop at target's min_r or adjust for existing non-background cells in the path. They also assume thickness 2 blindly, leading to overflows or wrong positions. The single-loop optimization is inefficient/unnecessary and complicates debugging; better to use nested loops for clarity. Overall, the logic (vertical to bottom + horizontal at bottom) is incorrect for the puzzle's varying connection styles.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed to match expected outputs, indicating partial understanding: starts and targets are detected correctly (e.g., colors like 4 in ex1, 6/3 in ex2, 3/6/4 in ex3), background identified right (3 in ex1, 1 in ex2/ex3), but path drawing is wrong.
 * Train 1: Generated vertical 8's in columns 1-2 from top to ~row 10, plus misplaced 8's in mid-grid (e.g., rows 7-8 cols 8-9) and bottom horizontals too narrow/wrong position; expected has verticals hugging the right side of the 1-block (cols 8-9), full horizontal 8's across rows 7-8 cols 4-17 connecting to 4's, and extended 8's in rows 14-15 cols 4-21. Missed thickening horizontals to full blocks in some areas and vertical extensions below targets; overpainted some 3's as 8's incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated scattered 8's in cols 4-5 and 7-8 from top, with incomplete horizontals (e.g., row 2 cols 13-20 as 1's instead of 8's) and wrong verticals in row 10 (cols 8-9 as 8's but expected 1's); expected has paired 8's in cols 4-5 and 8-9, full horizontal 8-block in rows 2-3 cols 13-20, vertical 8's only to target's level in some places, and no overpainting of 3's or 6's. Mismatch in connection thickness and horizontal span (generated too spotty, missed full 8-block for the middle target).
 * Train 3: Generated vertical 8's in cols 4-5 and 7-8 from top, with extra 8's in row 4 cols 8-9 (overpainting 3's) and misplaced horizontals (e.g., row 11 cols 12-13 as 8's but expected 7's); expected has asymmetric verticals (e.g., cols 3-4 for first, then full 8-blocks in rows 4-5 and 11-12), horizontals at multiple levels (e.g., row 4 full across 0-19), and verticals stopping at target tops or extending precisely. Overfilled backgrounds and wrong column pairs (e.g., used s and s+1 blindly, but expected shifts like col 3 for start at ?).
 * General issues: Program assumes fixed vertical drop to target's bottom + horizontal only at bottom, but expected shows variable connection points (e.g., horizontals at target's top/mid in ex1/ex3, verticals not always thickness 2 or from absolute top). No handling for multiple targets per color or overlapping paths. Edge handling weak (e.g., s+1 overflow in narrow grids). extract_main_grid and find_target_box worked well (bounding boxes match implied targets), but filling logic is core failure—paths seem to "reach" the target side (left/right) rather than always bottom.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows vertical 8's only in cols 1-2 from rows 3-16 (too narrow, wrong position—likely from a single start at col 1?), with horizontals at row 13 cols 9-21 and row 17 cols 7-16 (spotty and misplaced), overpainting some 9's as 8's (e.g., row 7 col 9) and leaving most 9-block unfilled. Expected likely needs paired 8's hugging the 9-block's sides (e.g., cols 3-4 and 10-11 vertical from top to target's bottom ~row 17, full horizontal 8's across the 9's at bottom row 17 cols 3-21, and no changes to top 2's or bottom 4's). Background seems 3 (right side), but 9's are targets (probably from starts in row 1 matching 9), and generated misses connecting to the large 9-block properly—looks like partial vertical from wrong start column, incomplete horizontals, and no thickness 2 consistency. This suggests the program's s/s+1 vertical assumption fails here (test may have start at col 0 or multiple, requiring adjusted columns), and it over-relies on bottom-only horizontals without side connections.

[2025-10-03 01:13:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 01:37:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored regions (numbers 1-9 representing blocks or blobs of color) on a background, with initial 8's acting as seeds or starting points for paths; the goal is to extend and connect these blocks using lines of 8's (likely representing wires, paths, or bridges) in horizontal and vertical directions, filling background areas to link specific blocks while preserving existing colors and avoiding overwriting non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks are connected components of the same color, identified via flood fill (excluding background and 8's); these must be detected accurately to determine which ones to connect (e.g., upper blocks extend upward, bottom block anchors lower connections).
 * 8's are the fill color for paths and should only overwrite background cells, not existing colors or other 8's; paths often form cross-like or H-shaped connections between left, middle (seed), and right blocks, with verticals spanning full heights or partial ranges and horizontals bridging gaps.
 * Background is typically the dominant color (e.g., 3 in ex1, 1 in ex2, 7 in ex3) at canvas[0][0], but 5's in input may be placeholders to replace with background; the canvas starts from row 5 of input, suggesting a header or metadata in top rows.
 * Seed (initial 8 position) determines the middle vertical path; upper blocks (above seed row) may need special extension (e.g., one row up for all, two rows for the leftmost), while bottom block (lowest center) anchors lower horizontals.
 * Connections are not symmetric: left vertical often spans from upper to lower, right from top to bottom or partial, middle from top to lower; horizontals include upper (near seed) from left to right, lower (near bottom) from left to edge, but must align precisely with block edges (e.g., starting after left block's right edge).
 * Subtle elements: Paths can create enclosed areas (e.g., full horizontal 8 lines in ex1 row 7-8 connecting left 1's to right 4's via middle); in ex2, a wide horizontal 8 bridge in row 2-3 spans almost the full width; in ex3, vertical 8's on left and right sides connect multiple levels, with a bottom horizontal bridge; avoid filling over existing blocks—e.g., don't overwrite the 4's in ex1 or 6's in ex3.
 * Handle varying grid sizes and block positions: blocks may not touch edges, seeds may be offset, and some connections skip rows/columns if blocked; ensure fills stop at grid bounds and don't create unintended loops.
 * The puzzle emphasizes precise alignment—e.g., in ex1, upper horizontal is only 2 rows high at seed level, lower is 2 rows near bottom; verticals must match block heights exactly for connections.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies blocks via flood fill and finds the seed, which is essential for locating connection points, but fails to produce correct outputs for all training examples due to incorrect fill positions and ranges.
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated has scattered 8's (e.g., top rows with partial 8's, vertical 8's only in middle cols 8-9 rows 8-10, no full horizontal bridge in rows 7-8); expected has full vertical 8's on left (cols 0-3 from row 3 down), middle (cols 8-9 full height), right (cols 16-17 partial), and horizontals connecting them (e.g., row 7-8 full 8's from col 0 to 21, lower partial); the program overfilled some backgrounds with original colors (e.g., row 0-1 has 5's instead of 3's) and missed the wide horizontal at seed level, likely due to wrong left_start/right_end calculations (set left_start=0 but no left block detected properly, right_start misaligned).
 * In training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated has minimal 8's (only cols 8-9 rows 9-10, some misplaced horizontals like row 0 partial 8's); expected has extensive 8 connections (e.g., horizontal full-width in rows 2-3 cols 4-21, verticals on left cols 4-5 full height, middle cols 8-9 partial, right cols 16-21 partial with wide bridge); program failed to detect side blocks accurately (e.g., left 2's and right 3's not positioned for full spans), resulting in no vertical fills from top to bottom and wrong upper/lower horizontal ranges (e.g., filled row 0 incorrectly with 8's over 5's).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated has almost no 8 extensions (only cols 12-13 rows 12-13, some bottom fills misplaced); expected has complex 8 paths (e.g., left vertical cols 3-4 from row 0 down to bottom, right cols 18-19 partial, multiple horizontals like row 4 full 8's cols 0-21, row 12-13 wide 8's); program incorrectly identified bottom block (likely as the 4's instead of central), leading to wrong lh1/lh2 (lower horizontal at rows 16-17 instead of varied), and extend_upper_blocks didn't trigger for upper 3's, missing upward extensions and side alignments (e.g., right_start set to -something invalid).
 * extend_upper_blocks partially works for extending leftmost upper block by 2 rows but fails to apply correctly (e.g., no extension seen in generated ex1 rows 3-4); get_bottom_block and get_side_blocks are conceptually helpful but buggy in selecting (e.g., compares tuples directly instead of indices, may pick wrong block if ties).
 * fill_vertical and fill_horizontal are useful and correctly only fill background, but called with wrong params (e.g., uh1/uh2 too narrow, left_start=0 but should be after block edge, right_end miscalculated as seed_j+1).
 * get_main_canvas works for skipping rows and replacing 5's, but in ex1 generated row 0-1 still has 5's (possible off-by-one in replacement loop).
 * Overall, the attempt understands block detection and basic filling but misses puzzle's connection logic (e.g., full-width horizontals at key levels, verticals tying to block min/max_i precisely); no unhelpful functions, but direct tuple comparison in get_side_blocks is broken (use key=lambda b: (b[2] + b[3])/2 consistently).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it only adds a small 3x3 block of 8's in rows 8-10, cols 8-10 (near the seed), with no other fills, leaving most background (9's) unfilled and blocks (top 2's, left 1's, bottom 4's, right 3's) unconnected.
 * Expected likely includes vertical 8's on left (cols 0-3 from row 7 down to connect 1's to bottom), middle (cols 8-10 full height from seed), right (cols 21-23 partial to connect 3's), and horizontals (e.g., upper near row 7 full from left to right, lower near bottom bridging 4's); the minimal 8's suggest the program detected the seed but failed to identify side/bottom blocks properly (e.g., right 3's in cols 21-23 not treated as right_block, no extension or fills triggered), and no upper extensions for the 9's block above.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as connections should link all major blocks (similar to training examples' H or cross patterns); the isolated 8's ignore the wide 9's in middle rows 4-18 and don't bridge to edges, probably due to same issues as training (wrong block selection and fill ranges).

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 01:37:09] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating a Python program containing a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input, following unspecified puzzle rules for interpreting or transforming the grids.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid elements (e.g., extracting objects, counting features like holes or blobs, matching shapes), but no specific rules are provided—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or omissions based on criteria (e.g., hole counts or stretches across grid).
 * Inputs are grids (List[List[int]]), so code must parse 2D structures accurately; outputs should match expected puzzle solutions, possibly as strings, grids, or classifications.
 * All attempts must demonstrate puzzle understanding through correct handling of training examples before test; failures indicate lack of core structure.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure function signature matches expected (e.g., def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> ...); avoid syntax errors or unrelated code that prevents execution.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle rules extracted yet, so focus on boilerplate structure first; future attempts need functions for grid traversal, object detection (e.g., connected components), and rule application.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function entirely. Placeholder for future use:
```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> list:
    # Example: Identify connected components or blobs in grid
    # (Not implemented; essential for puzzles involving object counting or shape matching)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating the code was incomplete or lacked the entry point.
 * No puzzle logic was executed, so nothing worked—zero progress on visual rules, object extraction, or output generation.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the core requirement (presence of 'program' function), making it entirely unhelpful.
 * No functions like grid parsing or object extraction were present, so none can be salvaged; avoid generating non-functional code without the main function.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR due to missing 'program' function, so it does not make sense or look correct—it failed before any puzzle processing.
 * No actual output was generated for the test input, making it impossible to verify against expected puzzle solution (e.g., no grid transformation or rule application occurred).
 * This highlights that structural compliance is prerequisite; without it, test handling (e.g., applying rules to the specific test grid) cannot be assessed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving filling specific paths or branches (likely a tree, river, or connection puzzle) with a fill color (2 for maroon) starting from a seed element, guided by clues in the top rows, while respecting borders, regions, and empty spaces (0 or 8), without overwriting existing non-background elements like borders (3,5,6,7,9) or clues (1,4).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves regional boundaries defined by border colors (e.g., 3,5,7,9 act as walls that filling cannot cross; 6 may be special borders or clues).
 * Filling with 2 should only occur in background (0) or empty/unfilled (8) cells, but must be constrained to puzzle regions (e.g., between borders), not the entire grid—overfilling across borders is a major error.
 * Seed detection: The "seed" is likely a starting point for horizontal connection (often a partial 2 line in a middle row), but not necessarily the first row with any 2; it may be the primary horizontal trunk row.
 * Clue detection: Clues for vertical branches are in the top pattern row (row 1), but not strictly every 6 columns—detection should look for non-background/non-border cells (e.g., 1,3,4,6) that indicate branch starts, and branches may not span full height but stop at region boundaries or other clues.
 * Vertical filling: Branches from clues should fill downward/upward only within the current region (e.g., until hitting a border or another filled area), connecting to the horizontal seed but not extending beyond puzzle sections.
 * Horizontal filling: Connect across the seed row but only within the main playable area (skipping borders like column 0 or 23), and only where 0/8; do not fill the entire width if borders block.
 * Subtle elements: Some regions have internal dividers (e.g., vertical 1s or 4s that limit spread); 8s are pre-empty spaces to fill, but existing 2s in input should be preserved/extended; puzzles have multiple sections (e.g., left/middle/right panels separated by borders); bottom rows may have partial fills or patterns that interact with verticals.
 * Overall goal: Create connected paths (horizontal trunk + vertical branches) that match expected filled regions, often leaving some 8s unfilled if not part of the connection; avoid filling clue areas or borders.
 * Easy to miss: Clue columns aren't uniform (e.g., in train 1, clues at cols ~8-9,16-17; step of 6 misses some); seed row may have existing 2s that need extension, not full overwrite; verticals may need to stop at horizontal barriers (e.g., full rows of 3s or 1s).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Rule: Create a deep copy of the input grid to avoid mutating the original
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for safe manipulation.)

```python
def find_seed_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Observation: The seed row is the first row containing the fill color 2 (maroon), typically in the main area
    h = len(g)
    for r in range(h):
        if 2 in g[r]:
            return r
    return -1  # No seed found
```
(This is partially helpful for locating the trunk row, but may need refinement to find the primary horizontal seed, not any 2.)

```python
def fill_horizontal(g: List[List[int]], r: int, start_c: int, end_c: int) -> None:
    # Rule: Fill horizontal line at row r from start_c to end_c with 2 (maroon) only in background (0) or empty (8) cells
    for c in range(start_c, end_c + 1):
        if g[r][c] in (0, 8):
            g[r][c] = 2
```
(This is helpful for targeted horizontal filling, but needs better start/end detection to respect borders.)

```python
def fill_vertical(g: List[List[int]], c: int, start_r: int, end_r: int) -> None:
    # Rule: Fill vertical line at column c from start_r to end_r with 2 (maroon) only in background (0) or empty (8) cells
    for r in range(start_r, end_r + 1):
        if g[r][c] in (0, 8):
            g[r][c] = 2
```
(This is helpful for vertical branches, but start_r/end_r must be region-bounded, not full height.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly copies the grid and only fills 0/8 cells, avoiding overwrites of borders/clues— this worked well across all examples.
 * Seed row detection found rows with initial 2s (e.g., row 1 in train 1/2/3 and test), which is a good start for identifying the trunk.
 * Horizontal filling extended existing 2s in the seed row, partially matching expected connections (e.g., in train 1, it filled some 0s to 2s in row 1 cols 2-4,8-10,14-16,20-22, but overdid it by filling across borders like col 0/23 which stayed 5 but disrupted regions).
 * Vertical filling from detected clues connected some branches (e.g., in train 1, filled col 7? but code targets cols 1,7,13,19; actually filled cols based on row1 non-0/6/8, but step 6 missed some like col 19-20 pair).
 * However, clue column detection with fixed step 6 failed: In train 1, it hit cols 1,7,13,19 but clues are paired (e.g., 8-9,16-17? wait, row1 has 1 at col1,6 at7,4 at13,2 at19-22— so detected 1,13,19 but missed nuances; generated verticals overfilled full height, ignoring borders like row5-6 full 5s.
 * Full horizontal fill (0 to w-1) ignored borders, filling into border areas (e.g., train 1 row1 col0/23 stayed 5, but middle overfilled beyond regions; expected no full row1 2s, instead partial vertical 8-to-2 in lower areas).
 * Vertical full height (0 to h-1) overfilled: In train 1, it filled cols 1,13,19 full down, turning many 3s/1s/4s areas to 2 where shouldn't (but code skips non-0/8, so only filled 0/8, but still wrong extent—e.g., generated row22-24 full 2s in cols4-14, but expected only bottom row16-18 partial 2s).
 * In train 1, generated mismatched by filling top row1 horizontal fully with 2s (e.g., [5,1,2,2,2,5,...] became all 2s where 0, but expected keeps top as clues and fills lower 8s to 2 in specific vertical/horizontal pockets like rows3-15 cols8-9/16-17 to 2, but actually expected shows 8s remaining in some, 2s only in bottom horizontal row16 cols4-14 and partial verticals.
 * Train 1 also mismatched blob shapes: Generated bottom rows22-24 as partial 2s only cols4-15, but expected row16 cols4-14 2s; unknown why, but likely because seed was row1, not bottom.
 * In train 2, similar overfill: Horizontal in row1 filled to [5,2,2,2,2,5,...], verticals in cols1,7,13,17? (detected row1 non-0/6/8: col1=2? input row1 [5,2,2,2,2,5,5,4,2,2,2,5,5,2,2,2,6,5,5,3,2,2,2,5] so cols1-4,7-10,13-15,19-22; step6 hit 1,7,13,19—filled those vertical full, turning many 1s areas wrong, e.g., row6-23 cols1,7,13,19 to 2 where 0/8, but expected has 8-to-2 in scattered verticals like cols4-5,8-9 and horizontal in row5 cols0-3/20-23? Wait, expected row0-1 cols4-5/8-9 to 8, row2-4 cols12-19? to 8, but 2s in row5 cols0-3, row6-10 cols0-3/16-19, etc.—mismatch in not filling 8s to 2 in branch pockets and overfilling seed.
 * Train 2 generated row11-12 cols0-3 as 2s (from vertical col1), but expected row5 cols0-3 as 2s (different seed?); unknown reason for row shift.
 * In train 3, clue detection step6 hit cols1,7,13,19 (row1 [5,2,2,2,4,5,5,6,2,2,2,5,5,3,2,2,2,5,5,2,2,2,2,5] so cols1-3,8-10,13-17,19-22; detected 1,7,13,19—filled vertical full, but overfilled into 7/3 areas; generated row13 cols3 as 2? but expected has 8-to-2 in cols3-4 rows0-3/19-20 rows3-? and full vertical 8s in col3 rows13-16? Mismatch: generated bottom row24 cols8-21 as 4s unchanged but horizontals wrong.
 * Function detect_clue_cols is broken/not helpful: Fixed step 6 assumes uniform 6-col sections, but sections vary (e.g., train1 has ~6 but paired clues; train3 has overlapping); better to scan row1 for specific clue patterns (non-0/6/8 clusters).
 * The program(g) composition is unhelpful overall: It assumes full-grid fills post-seed, ignoring region detection—leads to overfill; no boundary finding for sections.
 * No function for region detection (e.g., find borders to limit fills)—essential, as all mismatches stem from ignoring sections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills similar to training examples, with full horizontal 2s in row1 (e.g., [5,1,2,2,2,5,...] filled to 2s across where 0, ignoring borders at cols0/5/6/11/etc.), and vertical full-height 2s in detected cols (row1 clues:1 at1,2 at7-9,3 at10,2 at13-16,2 at19-22; step6 hits1,7,13,19—fills those down, turning row6 cols1/7/13/19 to 2, row9-10 full 2s? Wait, row6 is [2,2,2,...] already filled horizontal, but lower row13-16 cols3? as 1-to-2 wrong, row22-24 cols7? as 4s unchanged but adjacent 2s overfill).
 * It mismatches expected logic: Likely expected should fill 8s to 2 in specific branch pockets (e.g., row13 cols8-10 to 2 vertical, connecting to bottom), partial horizontal in row6 (already 2s, extend within 2/9 borders), and verticals only to region ends (e.g., stop at row21 full 9s); instead, generated has extraneous 2s in row9-10 full (over seed?), and unfilled 8s in row13 cols8-10 remain 8? No, vertical col7/13 would fill them if 0/8, but step6 may miss col8-10 clue cluster.
 * Test has unique elements like 9 borders (thicker sections?), row6 partial 2s as seed (not row1), clues in row1 with 1,2,3,4 indicating branch types/directions; generated treats row1 as seed (first 2), wrong—output has row6 overfilled to full 2s across borders (cols21-23 stay 3, but cols0-20 2s where possible), missing pocket fills like row13-15 cols8-10/ ? to 2.
 * Does not make sense: Overfills ignore 9/3 borders (e.g., row9-12 cols0-20 stay 9 but verticals punch through to row13 1s as 2 wrong); bottom row24-26 4s unchanged but adjacent 2s from verticals spill; expected likely connected tree with 2s in row6 horizontal within cols0-20, verticals from row1 clues down to row6 then branch to bottom pockets, leaving some 8s as empty.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 25-row grid (including clue rows at the top) to generate a 19-row output grid by identifying background colors, placing "seeds" (marked as 8) based on clue interpretations in specific positions and rows, propagating those 8's horizontally in certain "prop" rows (based on original 8 placements or rules), and filling remaining background areas while preserving other colored elements (like 1,2,4,6,9). The goal is to complete incomplete grid sections (marked with 5 as placeholders) according to visual logic rules derived from clues, likely a custom colored fill-in puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bkg) is determined by uniform rows excluding 5's; fallback to 3 if none found—must handle cases where bkg is 1,3,7,9 across examples.
 * Clue row (g[1]) uses groups at positions [1:5,7:11,13:17,19:23]; non-0/5 values indicate colors (1,2,3,4,6) that trigger seed pair placements (consecutive positions for 8's) based on position within group (0 or 3) and color-specific rules (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may shift pair based on next group, color 1 for lower rows shifts differently).
 * Seeds are placed as pairs of 8's in upper rows (0-15, using upper pairs up to max prop row) or lower rows (switching to lower pairs after max prop); only overwrite bkg areas.
 * Propagation of 8's: In rows with original 8's (has_prop), extend left/right from min/max 8 positions and fill gaps between 8's with 8's (assuming bkg in between); subtle: only in rows 0-15, and doesn't overwrite non-bkg.
 * Upper block (initial all-bkg rows) may get right-side propagation of 8's if "plus1" condition (rightmost seed starts at group_start+1) and limited to 2 rows.
 * Lower prop rows depend on first clue color (1→rows 14-15 right-fill from leftmost lower seed; 2→rows 13-14 same); fill rightward from seed start to end if bkg.
 * Replace all 5's with bkg globally after initial copy.
 * Subtleties: Upper/lower seed computation differs (is_lower flag affects activation for color 1 at pos 0); pair starts/ends vary by color/pos (e.g., color 6 at pos 0→start+1; color 2 at pos 3→start+3, special for last group); max_group limits (3 for upper,1 for lower); preserve non-bkg colors (1,2,4,6,9) and don't propagate over them.
 * Grid is 19 output rows x 24 cols; input may have full 25 rows with clues in 0-5? but code uses g[6:25] and g[1] as clue.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only in specific rows; seeds only in bkg areas; rightmost upper prop only if is_plus1 and in upper block; lower prop only if seeds exist and specific first color; no vertical propagation.
 * Other: Original 8's in input determine has_prop and max_prop_i (last such row); fallback bkg=3 may fail if true bkg differs (e.g., 1 or 7 in ex2/ex3).

These functions handle clue parsing and seed placement core logic; they seem partially correct but need tuning for pair positions and activation (e.g., color 1 handling).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of propagation and seed placement rules.
 * Train 1: Generated missing 8's in prop rows (e.g., row 9 has 3's instead of 8's at cols 4-5 and 8-9; row 10 similar; row 11 has 3's at 4-5/8-9; row 12 has 3's at 2-3 instead of 8's; row 13 similar; upper block prop not applied correctly, leading to no right-side 8's in early rows).
 * Train 1: Lower prop not triggered (first_clue_color likely 1 or 2, but no right-fill in rows 13-15 from seeds); seeds placed but propagation gaps not filled properly.
 * Train 2: Background detection failed (used 1? but prop extended incorrectly, e.g., row 10 has 8's at 4-5/8-9/14-17 but expected 1's at 4-5; row 11 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 12 has 8's at 4-5 but expected 1's; row 15 has 8's at 4-5/8-9 but expected 1's; lower prop overfills with 8's where bkg=1 should remain).
 * Train 2: Seeds placed in upper but switched to lower too early or incorrectly; prop in has_prop rows overwrote non-bkg (1's) with 8's in gaps; no handling for color 6 in clues properly.
 * Train 3: Background=7 correct, but seeds misplaced (e.g., row 0 has 8's at 8-9 but expected at 3-4; entire upper structure wrong—no 8's at expected positions like 3-4/19-20; prop in rows 4-6 overfills with 7's instead of 8's; row 7 has 2's at 0-2 but no 8's at 3-4; row 12 has 8's at 12-13 but expected full 8's row; lower rows like 16-18 have 4's starting at col 8 but bkg=7 not propagated correctly).
 * Train 3: Upper block detection failed (no initial all-bkg rows, but prop not applied to right side); lower prop not handled (first_clue_color= ? but no right-fill); pair computation for color 2/4/6 positions off (e.g., special last-group adjustment not triggering correctly).
 * Overall: compute_seed_pairs activates correctly for some colors but pair_start/end positions often wrong (e.g., shifts for color 4 based on next=2 not always accurate; color 1 lower shift to +3 misses cases); has_prop detection works but propagation doesn't stop at non-bkg or handle min/max correctly in all cases; upper/lower switch at max_prop_i too rigid; is_plus1 logic for upper right prop buggy (not triggering when needed); lower_prop_rows hardcoded to first_clue_color but may need more conditions; global 5→bkg works but applied too early, missing some placements.
 * find_background helpful but fallback=3 fails when bkg=1/7/9; get_clue_color useful for group colors.
 * No extraction of "objects" like blobs or connected components attempted—may be needed for verifying prop boundaries, but current code assumes horizontal fills only (unhelpful for vertical or shaped elements).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it retains many unprocessed 5's across rows (e.g., row 0 all 5's; rows 1-4 copy clue-like patterns with 5's and 0's unchanged; row 5 all 5's; rows 6-8 copy 2's and 3's but no 8's placed; rows 9-11 copy 9's and 3's; rows 12-18 mix 1's/9's/3's with some 8's in row 13 cols 8-9 but incomplete; rows 19-24 all 9's or mixed but no systematic 8 propagation or bkg fill).
 * Background not detected/filled (should be 3? based on fallback or uniform rows like row 5/0, but 5's remain everywhere); no seeds placed (clue_row=g[1] has 1 at col1, 3 at10,2 at13,4 at19—should trigger upper pairs at ~cols 2-3 (for1?), 8-9/14-15/20-21? but none appear).
 * Propagation absent (e.g., no 8's extended in potential prop rows; row 13 has isolated 8's but no left/right fill; lower rows like 19-21 have 9's but no right-fill from seeds if first_clue=1).
 * Output seems like a partial copy of input g[6:25] with minimal changes (only some 5→bkg? but many 5's persist; 0's unchanged, which may be invalid—puzzle likely requires full resolution to colors/8/bkg); does not match expected logic (e.g., should place 8 pairs in upper rows based on clues, prop in rows with original 8's like row 13?, fill bkg=3 in empties, preserve 2/9/1/4 blocks).
 * Likely issues: len(g)!=25 check failed or early return; clue parsing missed (0's in groups may skip activation); no has_prop rows detected (input has no original 8's?); upper_block_start not found properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 25x24 grid where the goal is to generate a modified 19-row output (rows 6-24 of the input) by detecting a background color, interpreting clues in row 1 to place pairs of "8" elements (representing seeds or props), and applying propagations to fill ranges of 8's based on rules for upper and lower blocks, while replacing 5's with background and handling special cases like right-fills and has-prop rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bkg) is determined by the most common non-0,5,8 value in rows 6+, defaulting to 3 if none; 5's are always replaced by bkg across the output.
 * Clues in row 1 are grouped in 4-cell blocks starting at columns 1,7,13,19; each group has a key color (first non-0/5 value) at a position (0-3) that dictates pair placement for 8's: e.g., position 0 with color 4/6 or (lower and 1) activates left-leaning pairs; position 3 with 2/4/6 activates right-leaning pairs; color 3 skips activation.
 * Upper pairs (for rows 0- max_prop_i in output indexing) are computed from all 4 groups (is_lower=False); lower pairs (for rows max_prop_i+1 to 18) use first group info and original 8-range if present.
 * Propagations: "has_prop" rows (any original 8) fill 8's across min-max 8 columns; right-fill propagates 8's from a start column to end in specific upper/lower blocks; upper block is initial all-bkg rows (up to 2 for right prop); lower prop starts at row 13/14 with 2 rows of fill/propagation based on first color (1/4 triggers pair, 1/2 triggers right-fill, else has-prop).
 * Subtleties: Pair starts/ends vary by color/position (e.g., color 1 pos0 -> start+3; color 2 pos3 -> start+3 but special for last group; color 4 pos0 checks next group's color for +3 vs +1); original 8-range is min-max columns with 8 in rows 6-24; max_prop_i is highest has_prop row index; rightmost upper pair determines if +1 offset for right_fill_start; lower left_fill_start from first pair or original min.
 * Easy to miss: First group handles color 1 specially for lower; lower prop num=2 but clipped to 19; pairs only placed if activated and color !=3; output copies input rows 6-24 then modifies; invalid input returns empty list.
 * Across attempts: No full successes; common issues include over-placing 8's in non-prop areas, missing full range fills (e.g., not expanding to connect 8's properly), incorrect pair positions based on clue logic, and failing to handle block transitions (upper to lower) or special fills (right/left).

        if new_row[j] == bkg:
            new_row[j] = 8
    return new_row
```
(Fills gaps between min-max 8's in a row; core for has-prop, but unhelpful if applied too broadly without 8's present.)

```python
def is_all_bkg_row(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> bool:
    return all(cell == bkg for cell in row)
```
(Detects pure bkg rows for upper block end; helpful for limiting initial placements.)

The `compute_seed_pairs` and `get_first_group_info` functions are partially helpful for pair extraction but buggy (e.g., incomplete activation logic, special cases like gi=3 for color 2 mishandled); `place_seeds` is straightforward but overused without checks. Overall program structure (copy output, replace 5's, place then propagate) is a good skeleton but fails on block transitions and specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, bkg detection, and pair placement but fails all training examples due to incorrect propagations and pair positions.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8's in rows 7-8 (full middle fill too early) and row 9 (8's at 4-5 instead of connecting properly); missed full connection in row 7-8 (expected 0-3 as 1's unchanged, but placed 8's wrongly); lower rows 14-16 overfilled with 8's instead of partial; rows 16-18 correct for 2's but upper mismatches blob shapes (unknown why, possibly wrong upper_pairs or prop range).
 * Train 2: Generated wrong 8-range in row 2 (8's at 14-17 instead of 14-23 full); missed full 8-propagation in rows 2-3 (expected 8's to 23); row 5 has extra 8's at 16-17 where expected 1's; row 14 has 8's at 8-15 instead of none; row 15 partial 8's missing; lower rows 16-18 correct but upper prop fails to connect properly (e.g., row 8-9 should connect more).
 * Train 3: Generated wrong initial 8's in row 0-2 (3's at 8-17 instead of 8's? Wait, expected has 8's at 18-19 but generated 3's there initially?); rows 4-6 have 8's at 8-17 but expected full 0-4 8's in row 4; row 12 has 8's at 5-13 but expected none/more specific; row 13 overfills 8's at 5-13; row 14 partial but misses full 14-23 8's; lower row 16-18 has 7's at 3-4 instead of none, and 4's start too early without full prop.
 * Common misses: Over-placement of 8's in non-activated areas; incorrect block split (max_prop_i too low/high, leading to wrong upper/lower pairs); right-fill applied wrongly (e.g., starts too early or not at all); lower prop start/num hardcoded poorly (14 for 1/4 but affects fills); original 8-range not always used for lower pairs; has_prop applied universally instead of selectively.
 * Function `propagate_lower_prop_right_fill` is helpful for right-fills but unhelpful when misapplied (e.g., fills from wrong start, overfills empty rows).
 * Function `get_first_group_info` is broken for some colors (e.g., doesn't handle pos0 color=4/6 fully, leading to wrong lower pairs in Train 1/2).
 * Overall, attempt shows core structure but lacks precise clue-to-pair mapping and prop conditions; unhelpful to reuse raw `program` without fixes to activation and block logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an ERROR (invalid grid format: returned <class 'list'> instead of proper 19x24 List[List[int]]), indicating a crash likely from unhandled input dimensions, empty pairs, or index errors in propagation (e.g., pair_end >23 or max_prop_i invalid).
 * No generated grid to evaluate, but based on training failures, it would likely mismatch by over/under-placing 8's, wrong bkg replacement, or failed propagations (e.g., missing connections in has-prop rows or incorrect lower fills); does not look correct as it didn't produce output at all—must fix input validation and edge cases like no 8's or unusual clue colors to handle test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a 25-row by 24-column grid where rows 6-24 represent a drawable area with a background color, existing "8" elements (likely props or paint to propagate), and clues in upper rows (e.g., row 1) that dictate pair placements and fills of "8"s in upper (top ~half) and lower (bottom ~half) sections. The goal is to propagate and fill "8"s based on clue-derived rules for pairs, gaps, special connections, and background replacement, while preserving non-background elements like colored blocks (1-7,9).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection: Scan rows 6-24, count non-0/5/8 cells, pick most common as background (default 3); replace all 5's with it. Subtle: Ignores 0/5/8 to avoid miscounting empties/props/specials, but may fail if background is rare or tied to clues.
 * Clue row parsing: Clues in row 1, divided into 4 groups of 4 cells (starts at indices 1,7,13,19). Each group has a "color" (non-0/5 value) and "position" (0-3 offset where color appears). Color=0 or 3 skips group; others trigger pair starts based on color/pos combos (e.g., color 4 at pos 0 may depend on next group's color). Subtle: Last group (start 19) has edge case for pos=3/color=2 shifting to 18; pairs are always 2-wide (start to start+1), but computation varies (e.g., color 6 at pos 0 -> start+1; color 4 at pos 3 -> start+2).
 * Upper vs. lower sections: Upper is rows 0 to max_prop_i (index of last row with original 8's); lower is after. Place pairs as 8's only if the slot is all-background. Subtle: Upper uses multiple pairs from all groups; lower uses single pair from first group (with extra color=1 case at pos=0 -> start+3) or original 8-range if no special lower condition.
 * Original 8's range: Find min/max col with 8's in rows 6-24; used for lower fills if not special. Subtle: If no 8's, defaults to (24,-1) which skips.
 * Has_prop rows: Rows (0-18 relative) with any original 8; after placing pairs/seeds, fill gaps between min/max 8 in that row with 8's (connect blobs horizontally).
 * Special lower fills: For rows 14-15 (absolute 20-21?) if first group color in {1,2,4}, connect existing 8's to a target range (e.g., color=1 -> to col 23; color=2 -> from min_col to 23; color=4 -> from leftmost 8 to min_col). Subtle: Only if min_col <24 and 8's exist; applied after seeds but before/in gap fill? Order matters for connections.
 * Right fill upper: If upper pairs exist, find rightmost pair start; if it matches a computed group position and is at group_start+1, fill from that col to 24 with 8's—but only in the FIRST all-background row up to max_prop_i. Subtle: Only activates for specific cases (e.g., gi !=-1 and exact pos); seems to target a "spillover" but only once, which may miss multi-row propagation.
 * Propagation order: Replace 5's first -> compute pairs/ranges -> place seeds in upper/lower -> gap fill in has_prop rows -> special lower fills. Subtle: Gap fill only in has_prop (not all rows), and special lower overrides/reconnects based on color; no vertical propagation, only horizontal connects/fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty pairs/ranges skip; indices 0-23 cols; output is rows 6-24 modified. Subtle: Lower special skips if color not in [1,2,4]; background may be non-3 (e.g., 1 or 7 in examples); clues may have 0/5 as fillers.
 * General: Preserve non-bkg/non-8 (e.g., 1-4,6,7,9 blocks); no overwriting existing 8's; fills only on bkg slots.

The pair computation functions (compute_upper_pairs, compute_lower_pair) are partially helpful for deriving 2-wide starts from clues but buggy (see below; overcomplicated logic misses cases). apply_right_fill_upper is unhelpful/broken (only fills one row, specific pos, doesn't propagate). Gap fill logic in main loop is helpful but limited to has_prop rows only.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/only attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of clue parsing, background, and horizontal fills but fails all trainings due to incomplete propagation.
 * Train 1: Generated correctly places some upper pairs (e.g., 8,8 at cols 8-9 and 16-17 in early rows) and lower 2's/4's, detects bkg=3, but misses full connections in has_prop rows (e.g., row 7: generated has 8's only at 4-5? Wait, actually generated row7 [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,3,3] but expected starts 8's at col0; diff: generated delays left-fill until row8, and row11 has extra 3's vs expected 8's? Unknown why partial gap fill). Also, row12 generated has 8's at 0-1 but expected none there; special lower not triggering full right-fill in rows 14-16. Right fill didn't activate.
 * Train 2: Generated places upper pairs correctly in some rows (e.g., 8,8 at 4-5,8-9), bkg=1, but misses extending 8's in lower non-special rows (e.g., row3: generated 8's only partial vs expected full 13-23; row14: generated no 8's vs expected full connect). Lower pair computation wrong (places at wrong pos for color=6?). Special lower (rows16-18 with 4's) correct but upstream misses prevent full blobs. Gap fill skips non-has_prop or doesn't connect to min_col properly.
 * Train 3: Generated bkg=7 correctly, places some 8's (e.g., 3-4,18-19 pairs), but misses vertical consistency and full upper connects (e.g., row4: generated 8's at 8-9 but expected full 0-23 except edges; row5-6 similar partial). Has_prop gap fill incomplete (e.g., row11: generated connects some but leaves gaps at 8-17 vs expected full). Lower special not handled (rows16-18: generated 4's start at col8 but expected from col3; unknown pos miscalc). Right fill absent. Edge: row14 generated partial 8's vs expected more connects.
 * Overall: Pair logic over-relies on pos/color combos, missing spillover (e.g., color4 depending on next group often wrong). Gap fill only horizontal/per-row, no multi-row or full-section flood. Special lower misfires (wrong leftmost/to_col for colors). apply_right_fill_upper unhelpful (too narrow, only one row, didn't trigger in any train). No vertical propagation, leading to fragmented 8's. compute_lower_pair adds color=1 case but buggy (pos=0/1 overlap?). Program preserves colors well but under-fills 8's systematically.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it seems to mishandle background (fills early rows 0-2 with 2's, but if bkg=3 at end, why 2's? Possible clue color leak or wrong bkg detect—clues may have 2's dominating count). Upper pairs/seeds partial (e.g., row7 has 8's at 8-10 but fragmented with 9's; expected smoother connects based on trains). Has_prop gap fill inconsistent (e.g., row13: 8's scattered with 9's gaps vs expected solid blobs). Lower special likely wrong (rows17-18: 4's at 7-15 but 8's/9's around; if first_color=4, should connect to min_col=3? but mixes with 9's). Ends with 9's, suggesting bkg=9 or un-replaced, but trains show preservation—output has too many isolated 8's and no full right-fills. Doesn't match train patterns (e.g., no solid lower 8-range); likely misses clue-dependent pairs and over-relies on original 8's which may be sparse. Unknown test clues/grid, but fragmented 8's/9's suggest broken pair computation or gap fill not extending to edges.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to generate a 19x24 output grid (rows 6-24 of the input) representing a support structure filled with 8s (beams or props) on a background color, based on clues in row 1 that dictate group-based pair placements, anchors from original 8s, propagation of fills, and special conditional rules for upper/lower sections, while replacing temporary 5s with background and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid is 25 rows by 24 columns; output must be exactly rows 6-24 (19 rows x 24 cols), with all non-8 cells set to the detected background color (most common non-0/5/8 value in output rows, defaulting to 3 if none).
 * Clue row (g[1]) is divided into 4 groups starting at columns 1,7,13,19 (each 4 cols wide); each group has a "color" (1-7, non-0/5) and "pos" (0-3 offset where color appears), which triggers specific pair placements (cols for 8-pairs) in upper (top half) or lower (bottom half) sections, with activations only for certain color-pos combos (e.g., color 1 pos 0 triggers lower pairs and left support at col 4-5; color 2/4/6 at pos 0 or 3 trigger upper pairs with offsets like +1, +3).
 * Anchor range is the min-max columns of original 8s in input rows 6-24; these must be filled with 8s across all output rows if background, but only in "has_prop" rows (those originally containing any 8).
 * Upper pairs apply to rows <= max_has_prop (upper block), lower pairs to rows > max_has_prop (lower block); special left support pairs (col 4-5) apply only to upper has_prop rows if color 1 pos 0.
 * Propagation: In has_prop rows, fill all background cells between min and max 8 positions with 8s (gap filling).
 * Special fills: If color 1 pos 0, fill cols 4+ to end with 8s in specific lower rows (14-15, 0-indexed in output); for upper right fill, if rightmost upper pair starts at group_start+1, fill cols from that start to end in the first 2 all-background upper rows.
 * Subtleties: Pairs only place if both cells are background (no overwrite); color 4 at pos 0 may skip next group if followed by color 2; background detection ignores 0/5/8; 5s are placeholders to replace with background before placing; has_prop rows are only those with original 8s, and max_prop_i is their max index (splits upper/lower); for last group (start 19), pos 3 color 2 adjusts pair_start to 18; empty groups (all 0/5) or color 3 skip pairs; propagation is per-row and only in has_prop rows; upper right fill requires detecting "plus1" starts and finding initial all-background block (may be 0-2 rows).
 * Edge cases: No original 8s means no anchors/propagation/max_prop_i=-1 (all upper pairs, no lower/left support); test input may have different dimensions or empty clues, causing format errors; overwrites must be avoided, but fills can expand existing 8s; lower right fill is narrow (only rows 14-15, cols 4+); upper block for right fill is prefix of all-background rows.

**Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `compute_lower_pairs`: Too simplistic; only handles color 1 pos 0 with fixed pair at 1+3=4, but misses broader lower rules (e.g., no pairs for other colors, and doesn't integrate with has_prop split properly; generated outputs show missing lower 8s in Train 2 rows 2-4, where expected has 8s at 13-23).
- `apply_lower_right_fill`: Hardcoded to rows 14-15 (output indices 8-9?) and cols 4+, but only if color 1 pos 0; broken for general cases, as Train 1 generated no such fill but expected subtle right 3s (not 8s); causes overfill or miss.
- `apply_upper_right_fill`: Complex but buggy; detects "plus1" but fills only first 2 all-bkg upper rows from rightmost pair start; in Train 1, it overfills right cols 22-23 with 8s in early rows (generated has 8,8 vs expected 3,3), and in Train 3, it doesn't trigger correctly, missing full right expansions.
- `place_seeds`: Attempts conditional placement but ignores full grid state; places anchors everywhere (even non-has_prop), causing overfill in lower blocks (e.g., Train 1 rows 16-18 have extra 8s in cols 4-15 where expected 2s/3s); also places pairs without checking has_prop boundaries properly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of clue parsing (groups, colors, pos) and background/anchor basics, but fails on conditional placements, propagation limits, and special fills, leading to all trainings incorrect.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 8-pairs at cols 22-23 in rows 0-2,6-12 (vs expected 3,3 there, indicating overactive upper right fill or anchor expansion); rows 4-6 have 8,8 at 22-23 vs expected 3,3 or 4,4/3,3; rows 9-10 have 3,3 at 22-23 vs expected 3,3 (match) but earlier mismatches like row 8 has 4,4/3,3 vs 4,4/3,3 (partial match); row 12 has 3,3 at end vs 3,3 (match); lower rows 14-15 overfill cols 4-23 with 8s vs expected 8s only in anchor range; rows 16-18 have 2s starting at col 4 but expected same (match, but propagation missed gaps). Propagation works partially but applies anchors too broadly.
 * Train 2: Generated missing wide 8-fill in rows 2-4 cols 13-23 (has 1,1/1,1/1,1 vs expected 8s across, indicating failed lower pair or right fill trigger for color 6); row 14 has 8s cols 8-15 vs expected 8s cols 8-23 (underfill right); row 15 overfills cols 0-7 with 1s? Wait, generated 1s but expected 8s cols 0-23 partial; lower rows 16-18 match 4s but no 8-propagation into them. Upper pairs placed correctly for cols 4-5/8-9 but missed color 6 specifics (pair at 13?).
 * Train 3: Generated partial anchor fills but missed full expansions, e.g., rows 4-6 have 8s at 8-9/18-19 but expected wider 8s cols 0-7/16-19 in some; rows 11-12 have 8s cols 3-23 but expected 8s cols 3-19/6+; row 13 has 7s cols 0-2/20-23 vs expected 8s expansions; row 14 underfills cols 0-2/20-23; lower rows 16-18 have 4s cols 8-21 but expected 4s cols 8-21 with 7s edges (match but no prop). Color 2/6 triggers partial pairs but propagation doesn't connect to anchors fully; left groups (cols 0-3) have mismatched 7/2 vs expected 8 expansions.
 * Common issues: Over-placement of anchors/pairs outside has_prop (e.g., full grid anchors in Train 1 lower); incorrect upper/lower split (max_prop_i not limiting lower pairs properly, causing Train 2 underfill); special fills trigger wrongly (extra right 8s in Train 1, missing in Train 3); replace_fives works (no 5s remain) but background=3 assumed correctly; compute_upper_pairs misses skips (e.g., Train 1 color 4 pos? followed by 2?); no handling for empty has_prop (max_prop_i=-1 leads to all-upper, but Train 2 expects lower 8s).
 * get_group_info and find_background are solid (clues parsed right, bkg=3/1/7 matches inputs); place_pair is helpful but too permissive (no full conflict check beyond bkg).

**Test output:**
 * No valid generated output (ERROR: returned <class 'list'> instead of List[List[int]]); likely a bug in program() return (e.g., slicing g[6:25] fails if input !=25 rows, or empty output [] if dimensions wrong); this suggests the program assumes fixed 25x24 but test input may vary (e.g., smaller grid or non-list), causing crash—does not make sense as output, as it can't be verified; expected output unknown without rules run, but mentally: if test has unique clues (e.g., color 3 skips, or no 8s), output should be mostly bkg with minimal pairs/anchors; to fix, add dimension checks and return empty/fixed grid on error, but current crash indicates poor robustness for test case.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top rows (likely 0-5) represent an "above-ground" or sky area filled with background, and the content from lower rows (6+) is shifted up into a new grid. The number 8 represents a filling substance (e.g., "sand" or "growth") that originates from seed positions in the shifted content and expands vertically upward and horizontally sideways into background areas, but only in connected regions without crossing barriers (possibly number 5 acts as a barrier since it's skipped in copying). The goal is to produce a filled grid matching the expected patterns, where 8's propagate in a way that forms connected blobs, often widening horizontally at certain levels and filling "pockets" above the seeds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a fixed structure: 25 rows x 24 columns (based on output lengths), with background determined from g[6][0], suggesting row 6 is a reference for ground level or initial background.
 * Shifting: Content from rows 6+ of input g is copied to rows 0+ of output, but only non-5 values are preserved; 5's are treated as erasable or barriers (replaced with background), and top 6 rows of output are pure background— this works partially but leads to incomplete fills if expansion doesn't account for post-shift connections.
 * Seeds for 8's: Identified as positions with 8 in rows 6+ of input (shifted to 0+), collecting unique columns and the lowest (max row index) seed row; this identifies starting points but misses that expansion should connect across multiple seeds horizontally if they are at similar levels or via background.
 * Vertical expansion: Fills upward (from max_row +1 to top) only in exact seed columns if background—this is too narrow; expected outputs show 8's filling entire connected horizontal spans (e.g., widening to multiple columns) and propagating up through adjacent background cells, not just vertically in seeds.
 * Sideways expansion: Only at the specific lower_row (max seed row shifted), expanding left/right from min/max seed columns until non-background—this is limited to one row and doesn't propagate upward or connect blobs; expected shows horizontal fills at multiple rows (e.g., full-width 8's in some levels) and diagonal-ish connections.
 * Barriers and non-fills: 8's do not overwrite existing non-background numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 stay intact); only background is filled. Number 5 is skipped in initial copy, acting like a temporary barrier or void. Expansions stop at edges or other numbers. Subtle: Fills can "bridge" across background at various heights if connected to seeds via paths (e.g., in training 1, 8's extend right to col 16-17 in top rows, suggesting horizontal connectivity above seeds).
 * Connectivity: Likely requires flood-fill-like behavior (BFS/DFS from seeds upward and sideways through background only), not just linear expands— this is a key miss, as current code treats seeds independently without merging blobs. Also, fills may not go infinitely up (stops at top or barriers), and some expected patterns show 8's "hanging" or widening mid-grid.
 * Other elements: Existing shapes (e.g., 1's, 2's, 4's) remain but may get 8's filled around/above them; bottom rows in some examples have unchanged patterns (e.g., 2's in training 1). Grids may have multiple disconnected 8 blobs that need independent expansion. Easy to miss: Expansions can happen in "pockets" above barriers, and seeds might not be in every column, requiring horizontal spread before vertical.
 * All training examples failed due to under-filling: 8's didn't spread wide enough horizontally or connect across rows/columns as in expected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current functions provide a basic framework for shifting and seed detection but need enhancement for proper expansion (e.g., integrate flood fill).

```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[6][0]  # Helpful: Correctly identifies background from a fixed reference point.
```

```python
def shift_and_fill(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    out = [[background for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
    for i in range(18):  # Assumes h=24, shifts 18 rows (6+ to 24)
        for j in range(w):
            val = g[i + 6][j]
            if val != 5:
                out[i][j] = val
    return out  # Helpful: Basic shifting and 5-skipping works (preserves shapes), but top 6 rows are correctly background-filled; issue is post-shift expansion.
```

```python
def find_seed_columns_and_max_row(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    seed_cols = set()
    max_row = -1
    for i in range(6, h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] == 8:
                seed_cols.add(j)
                if i > max_row:
                    max_row = i
    return list(seed_cols), max_row - 6 if max_row >= 6 else -1  # Helpful: Accurately finds 8 seeds in lower input rows and computes shifted max row; useful for starting flood fill from these points.
```

The expansion functions (expand_vertical, expand_sideways) are broken/not helpful: They perform linear fills only in seed columns or at one row, missing connected region filling—do not reuse without major changes (e.g., replace with flood fill from all seeds).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single summarized attempt (the provided program); it partially understands shifting and seed detection but fails on expansion logic across all training examples.
 * Worked: Background detection is correct (matches all examples). Shifting copies non-5 content accurately (e.g., preserves 1's, 2's, 4's shapes in all trainings). Seed column collection identifies starting 8 positions correctly (e.g., cols 8-9 in training 1).
 * Didn't work: Vertical expansion too narrow (only seed cols, no horizontal connectivity upward), leading to thin 8 columns instead of wide blobs (e.g., training 1 generated 8's only in cols 8-9 top-to-mid, but expected has cols 4-5 + 8-9 + extensions to 16-17; training 2 misses cols 4-5 and wide row 2-3; training 3 misses left/right spreads from col 3-4 to wider 8's).
 * Sideways expansion limited to one row (lower_row), no propagation (e.g., training 1 generated no right extension to col 16-17 in top rows; expected connects horizontally at multiple levels. Training 2 generated no 8's in cols 4-5 or wide row 2; expected has them. Training 3 generated 8's only in cols 12-13 mid-grid, but expected has full rows 4-5 as 8's from col 0-11+).
 * Overall under-filling of 8's: Generated outputs have fewer/sparser 8's than expected (e.g., training 1: generated row 8 has 8's only cols 8-9 + some lower, expected has cols 4-17; row 12 generated no 8's in col 4-5, expected has them. Training 2: generated row 2 has 8's only cols 8-9, expected cols 4-5+8-9+14-21. Training 3: generated row 4 has 7's where expected has 8's in cols 0-3+12. Differences are consistent: lack of blob merging and upward horizontal spread).
 * No handling of multi-level connectivity or flood fill, causing isolated 8's (e.g., unknown why training 1 row 9-10 have 8's only in cols 4-5? Wait, generated has 3's there, expected 8's—likely missed vertical from adjacent seeds).
 * Function expand_vertical is unhelpful/broken: Linear per-column fill ignores horizontal neighbors (don't reuse).
 * Function expand_sideways is unhelpful/broken: Single-row expansion doesn't propagate (don't reuse).
 * find_seed_columns_and_max_row is essential/helpful: Reuse for seed detection, but expand from all seeds simultaneously via flood fill.
 * shift_and_fill is essential/helpful: Core shifting works, but ensure post-shift grid allows connected fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and shows misunderstanding of expansion rules. It has 8's only in cols 8-10 for top 3 rows (narrow, like failed vertical expand), then mostly 9's in mid-grid with isolated 8's in row 7 cols 8-10, and bottom rows with 2's and a partial 4's row (row 17 has 4's in cols 7-16, but shifted oddly). This mismatches likely expectations: Based on patterns, test input probably has seeds in lower parts (e.g., around cols 8+), requiring wide 8 fills upward into background pockets around 9's and 1's, connecting horizontally (e.g., full-width 8's mid-grid like training 3, or extensions around 9's blob). Instead, generated under-fills 8's (no wide spreads), leaves excessive 9's unfilled, and doesn't connect bottom 2's area—looks like incomplete shifting/expansion, similar to training failures (e.g., no bridging over 9's). Make sure to account for flood-filling connected background regions from all seeds upward/sideways to handle test case's probable large 9's structure and bottom 2's/4's.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 representing colors) where the top 6 rows appear to be a header or metadata, and the task is to extract and shift down the content below it, identify rectangular "panels" or blocks of uniform color (excluding background, 0, 5, 8), detect a special "maroon" (8) connector block, and then augment the layout by filling gaps and extending 8-colored borders to connect panels horizontally and vertically in a structured way, likely simulating comic panel borders or a unified strip.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background color (bg) is determined by the most common non-0/5/8 color in rows below y=6; this works but can miss if ties or edge cases occur.
 * Content blocks are only rectangles of uniform color c (1-9, excluding bg/0/5/8) larger than 4 cells, starting from the topmost row with that color; non-rectangular or small blobs are ignored, which is key but fails if blocks aren't perfectly rectangular or if detection misses partial overlaps.
 * Maroon (8) block detection expands from the first found 8 cell to its full rectangle; it's treated specially as a connector, but the code assumes only one and starts search from y=6, potentially missing if multiple or positioned oddly.
 * Output grid is the input height minus 6 rows, initialized to bg, with content blocks placed shifted up by 6 rows; this cropping and shifting is core but can clip blocks if they extend into the top 6.
 * Connections with 8: Horizontal fills in "connection rows" (where maroon overlaps after shift) between content edges and maroon; full vertical middle bar through maroon x-range; conditional left lower bar extension if content below on left; right upper bar if content above on right; bottom horizontal fill near lowest blocks, with height based on gap size (1 or 2 rows) and x-range adjusted by reach; upper right gap fills between stacked right-side blocks, limited by their heights and connection row.
 * Subtleties: 5 might be a special non-content/non-bg color (ignored in counts/blocks); connections only fill bg cells (not overwriting content); horizontal fills in connection rows set uniform x-start/end but code computes per row, leading to inconsistencies; bottom fill x-start uses left_bar if extended, else maroon start, and x-end checks if lowest blocks reach right; upper right fills only for blocks entirely right of maroon and above connection, filling from right_bar to edge but only in gaps; no overwriting of existing non-bg; assumes w is constant; potential issues with y_min=6 exactly or maroon not overlapping content vertically after shift.
 * Edge cases: No maroon (returns empty, no connections); no blocks (empty output); maroon above y=6 (clips); overlapping blocks (detection takes first topmost); small gaps (h=1 vs 2 for bottom); right-side stacks with varying heights; left/right extensions only if content "touches" bar x-range; all fills are 8-only, no other colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of connection rules.
 * Train 1: Generated correctly shifted and placed blocks (1's left, 4's right, 2's bottom), detected bg=3 and maroon at x=8-9, but missed extending 8's rightward in upper connection rows (expected 8's at x=16-17 in rows 0-6); lower left 1's connected partially but no bottom horizontal 8's under gap; rows 9-11 have 8's only in maroon without left extension to x=4; rows 12-14 missing left 8's entirely; bottom 2's placed but no connection.
 * Train 2: Generated placed blocks (2's left, 3's right, 4's bottom, 6's mid-right) and maroon at x=8-9, bg=1, but missed left 8 extensions in rows 0-4 (expected at x=0-1); row 2 has extra 8's in right but overwrote or misfilled; connection rows (likely 5-9) have partial horizontals but no full upper right 8 bar in rows 14-15; bottom 4's isolated without connection.
 * Train 3: Generated bg=7, blocks (2's left, 3's top, 4's bottom, 6's right), maroon at x=12-13, but missed left 8 extensions in early rows (expected at x=0-1 in rows 0-3); row 4 has full 8's but overwrote 3's incorrectly; middle bar partial; lower extensions missing in rows 13-16 (expected more 8's under 7's); bottom 4's connected but x-range wrong (starts too left); upper fills incomplete.
 * Block detection generally works for rectangles but may miss if not starting exactly at topmost full row or if >4 size threshold excludes small panels.
 * Maroon detection finds block but expansion assumes horizontal then vertical, which fails if irregular shape.
 * Connection logic attempts horizontals per row but sets uniform h_start/h_end incorrectly (uses first row's, ignores variations); left/right bar conditions check overlap but use wrong y-ranges post-shift; bottom horizontal gap calc uses min_y but h=1/2 based on >4 arbitrary; upper right gap fill sorts blocks but fills only to w, may overfill or underfill heights.
 * place_content_blocks clips y but doesn't handle x clipping; create_output_grid initializes correctly.
 * Overall, core shifting and block placement works in parts, but connection fills are inconsistent (e.g., no rightward extensions in train 1/2, missing vertical bars in train 3); function find_maroon_block is helpful but returns empty on no 8, skipping connections; get_background_color ignores 8 correctly but may pick wrong if sparse.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on training patterns; it shifts content down by 6 (top 3 rows of 2's become rows 0-2, bottom 4's to rows 17-19, 9's and 1's placed), detects bg likely as 3 or 9? but fills much of the grid with 9's incorrectly (e.g., rows 3-6,9-16 mostly 9's where expected might be isolated blocks), maroon at x=8-9 extended vertically but horizontals overfill (e.g., row 7 full 8's from x=3-20, but training suggests only targeted fills); right side has 8's at x=19-20 in some rows but inconsistent with expected connections; bottom rows 17-19 have 4's but surrounded by 9's instead of connected 8's; upper right (rows 20-23) all 9's with 8's, likely misbg or overfill; lacks targeted gap fills (e.g., no bottom horizontal under 1's/9's to 4's); overall too much 9-overwrite and missing precise 8-bars, doesn't match structured connections from training expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming a 24x24 grid by detecting a background color, creating a large structural "maroon" (color 8) overlay in the upper portion, shifting non-background shapes upward from the lower part of the original grid into this structure (with some exclusions and adjustments to avoid overlaps), filling remaining spaces with the background color, and applying targeted overrides to certain areas like the top rows. The goal is to produce a new grid that integrates shifted elements into a patterned maroon frame-like structure while preserving specific visual motifs from the original.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The maroon (8) structure is not a solid full-row block from rows 0-15; instead, it's a patterned frame or segmented bars (e.g., pairs of 8s separated by background color in specific columns, like cols 8-9 and 16-17 in train1, or more complex interruptions in train3), which gets partially overridden by shifted shapes but retains key segments to form a consistent "end" or boundary motif across examples.
 * Shapes to shift are non-background and non-zero, but the exclusion of color 8 (maroon) and 5 (possibly a special marker or small element) in the current program prevents placing original maroon elements or certain accents, leading to missing 8s in expected positions; subtle rule may be to shift all non-background except perhaps only exclude 0 and true background, or handle 5/8 differently per shape.
 * Shifting is mostly upward by 6 rows from original rows 6+, but with a variable shift (5 for rows >=21) to handle bottom elements without overlap; however, this doesn't account for per-shape alignment or column-specific placements, causing misalignment (e.g., in train1, shifted 1s and 4s don't align with expected positions around the maroon bars).
 * Background detection samples from rows 6-23 and non-zero cells in col 24? (code has range(24), but intent may be edge sampling); this works for uniform bgs like 3 or 1 but may fail if bg varies or has patterns.
 * Top rows (0-2) need override of maroon back to bg only in areas not intended for structure, but current full-row override erases too much (e.g., in train1 expected, top 8s remain in specific cols); subtle: overrides should be selective, perhaps only where no shifted shape or structure is present, or propagate bg only in empty top areas.
 * Bottom rows (16+) seem to receive shifted elements correctly in some cases (e.g., the 2-bar in train1 rows 16-17 matches), but in others like train2, shifted 4s and 1s are misplaced or overfilled with bg.
 * Original grid has "small ones" or accents (e.g., color 5?) that may need special handling, like omission or separate shifting, as noted in code comments but not implemented effectively.
 * Overall, the transformation creates a "scroll" or "panel" effect: upper half gets a maroon frame with inserted shifted shapes, lower half gets remaining shifted elements on bg, but must match exact patterns without overfilling 8s or misaligning shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Maroon structures vary slightly per example (e.g., full-width in lower parts of train1 row14-15, but interrupted in train3), suggesting detection or hardcoding of frame based on bg or global rules; also, some expected 8s appear in shifted positions, implying original 8s should sometimes be shifted too.
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes a fixed large maroon block, which ignores per-example frame patterns; shifting excludes too much, leading to loss of structural 8s; fill_background after shifting is good but happens too late/early in sequence for overrides.

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Samples non-zero pixels from lower-right area (rows 6-23, cols 0-23 effectively) to find dominant bg color; helpful for uniform bgs but may need expansion to full grid or edge detection for patterned bgs.
    pixels = [g[r][c] for r in range(6, 24) for c in range(24) if g[r][c] != 0]
    if not pixels:
        return 0
    return Counter(pixels).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def fill_background(new_g: List[List[int]], bg_color: int):
    # Fills all 0s with bg after placing structures/shifts; this is useful and correctly sequenced in the program, as it cleans up empties without overwriting placed elements.
    for r in range(24):
        for c in range(24):
            if new_g[r][c] == 0:
                new_g[r][c] = bg_color
```

```python
def place_top_override(new_g: List[List[int]], bg_color: int):
    # Overrides 8s to bg in top 3 rows; partially helpful for bg propagation but too broad—should be conditional on positions without structure or shifts to preserve expected 8 bars.
    for r in range(3):
        for c in range(24):
            if new_g[r][c] == 8:
                new_g[r][c] = bg_color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg color (e.g., 3 in train1, 1 in train2, 7 in train3) and partially shifts bottom shapes upward (e.g., the 2-bar in train1 rows16-17 and 4-bar in train2 rows17-18 land in reasonable positions without overlap).
 * Shifting logic works for avoiding bottom overlaps (variable shift 5/6) and excluding 0/bg, but fails by excluding all 5 and 8, causing loss of accent elements and failure to place original maroons into the structure (e.g., in train3, expected has shifted 8s in mid-grid, but generated has solid 8 blocks instead).
 * Large maroon placement as full rows 0-15 is incorrect—generates solid 8 blocks that get partially overridden, but expected has sparse, paired 8s (e.g., train1 top: 8s only in cols8-9/16-17 amid bg 3s; train2: similar pairs with 8s in shifted areas like row2 cols13-20).
 * Top override erases too many 8s, leading to full bg rows 0-2 in generated (vs. expected patterned 8s in train1/2/3 tops).
 * In train1: Generated has solid 8s in rows3-15 with left 1s overriding incorrectly (full left 4 cols as 1s in rows3-11, but expected has 1s only in row3 left, then 3s interrupting 8s); bottom 2s in rows17-18 match expected positions but row16 is wrong (full 3s vs. expected empty-ish).
 * In train2: Generated shifts 2s and 3s into solid 8s but misaligns (e.g., row5 2s start at col0 over 8s, but expected has them starting col0 with 8 interruptions); top rows have misplaced 1s/6s without patterns (row0-1 full 1s left/mid 6s, but expected has 8 pairs); bottom 4s in rows17-18 match but surrounded by wrong 1s.
 * In train3: Generated has solid 8s overriding everything, with 2s shifting to row7+ but not aligning (e.g., row7 2s at col0-2 over 8s, expected has them at col0-2 with 8s starting col3); top 7s/3s in row0-2 match bg but miss 8 pairs; bottom 4s in rows17-18 match positions but row16 has wrong 2s/7s.
 * place_shifted_shapes is mostly helpful for bulk shifting but broken for exclusions (skips 8/5, causing missing elements) and doesn't handle per-column or shape-specific adjustments.
 * place_large_maroon is unhelpful/broken: assumes uniform full-width 8s, but puzzle needs patterned 8 frames (e.g., detect or hardcode bar positions based on bg); don't use this as-is in future.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of shift+bg+override sequence but misses core patterned maroon rule, leading to all INCORRECT; no object extraction function present, which might help identify shapes for precise placement (e.g., detect bars and their cols).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it has full bg 2 rows 0-2 (but with right cols22-23 as 3, mismatched), solid 8 blocks in rows3-15 (overridden only by left 1s in rows6-12), and bottom shifts like 9s full in row16-18/20-23 with partial 4s in row18, but lacks any patterned 8 frames seen in training expecteds (e.g., no paired 8s separated by bg in top/mid).
 * It overfills 8s similarly to training fails, with shifts (1s from presumed original, 9s/4s bottom) misaligned—e.g., 1s only left in rows6-12 suggest incomplete shift exclusion, and row14-15 solid 8s vs. likely expected interruptions; bottom 9s seem like a wide shifted shape but dominate too much without bg interruptions.
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: misses the "frame" motif (e.g., expected likely has 8 bars in specific cols like 4-5/12-13 or similar, with 2/3 bg patterns integrated), and right-edge 3s in top suggest bg detection issue or unhandled original elements; to fix, need patterned 8 placement and inclusive shifting of certain colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic puzzle involving a 25-row by 24-column grid (with the output being a processed 19x24 subgrid from rows 6-24), where a clue row (row 1) encodes rules for placing "pillars" (filled with 8's) in specific columns, propagating them vertically and horizontally based on existing 8's (which indicate propagation zones), and filling regions to the right in certain cases. The goal is to deduce and apply these placements over a background color (most common non-special value), replacing 5's (likely placeholders) with background, while respecting group-based clues in the clue row divided into 4-cell groups starting at columns 1,7,13,19.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses numbers 0 (empty?), 5 (replaceable placeholder to background), 8 (pillar/fill indicator that propagates), and 1-7 (colors/regions); background is the most frequent non-0/5/8 value, defaulting to 3 if none.
 * Clue row groups (4 cells each at starts [1,7,13,19]) determine "pairs" of columns for pillars: activation based on non-0/5 color position (0 or 3 preferred) and value (e.g., 4/6 at pos 0 or 2/4/6 at pos 3 trigger pairs; special handling for adjacent groups like skipping or linking if next group has color 2).
 * Existing 8's in the 19x24 subgrid define "has_prop" rows (any 8 triggers horizontal propagation within pillar column bounds in that row) and original pillar columns (all columns with any 8, which get full vertical pillars).
 * Upper pillars (from clue pairs) fill from row 0 down to max_has_prop_row; lower pillars fill from max_has_prop_row+1 to bottom.
 * Subtleties: Pair starts vary by color/pos (e.g., color 6 at pos 0 -> start+1; color 4 at pos 0 may link to next group if next is 2, setting start+3 and skipping next; for last group pos 3 color 2, adjust to 18). Horizontal propagation only in has_prop rows, between min/max pillar columns. Right-fills: For upper-right, if rightmost pair is at group_start+1, fill 1-2 empty (all 0/bkg) rows starting from first such row up to max_prop, from pair_start to col 23 with 8's—but only if condition met, using temp grid copy from original. For lower-bottom, if first clue color is 1 (1 row) or 2 (2 rows), fill bottommost empty lower rows (all 0/bkg/8) from min pillar/orig col to 23 with 8's.
 * Easy to miss: max_prop_i is max has_prop index (0-18), or -1 if none; pillars overwrite only 0/bkg (preserve existing colors like 1/2/4/6/7). compute_upper_pairs_with_gi tracks group index (gi) for right-fill logic; lower pairs don't need gi. Pair validation: pair_start +1 <24. In lower fill, start_col depends on first color (pillar min for 1, orig min for 2). Temp grid in upper_right_fill checks original state before placements for "empty" detection. All fills are with 8's, but existing non-0/bkg cells (e.g., colors) are preserved.
 * Across attempts: Background detection/replacement works but may not handle all cases (e.g., if 8's skew counts). Pair computation has bugs (e.g., lower pairs limited to max_group=0, missing later groups; upper pairs skip logic inconsistent). Propagation misses vertical full-fills in some orig cols or horizontal bounds. Right-fills overfill/underfill (e.g., wrong row counts or starting points; temp grid deepcopy may fail if original_g altered). Error in test: Program returns list but invalid format (likely wrong dimensions or non-list-of-lists).

(These handle vertical pillar placement and horizontal propagation correctly in principle, but order matters—call after pair computation, before fills; overwrite only 0/bkg to preserve colors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of pair computation, propagation bounds, and fill rules; test input crashed with invalid format (likely due to early return [] if dimensions mismatch, or deepcopy/copy issues in apply_upper_right_fill).
 * Train 1: Generated overfilled pillars in rows 9-11 (cols 4-7 as 3's instead of 8's; expected 8's there for horizontal prop), underfilled row 12 (cols 0-1 as 1's instead of 8's? Wait, expected has 8's in cols 4-5 but generated 3's in some; row 13-14 cols 0-3 as 3's instead of 8's; row 15 full 8's but expected partial; bottom rows have 8's in cols 2-3 where expected 3's). Differences suggest missed horizontal prop in non-full has_prop rows and wrong min/max pillar (included too many cols like 0-3). Upper right fill likely over-applied, turning expected 3's to 8's in row 15.
 * Train 2: Generated mismatched colors/pillars, e.g., row 10 cols 0-3 as 8's instead of 1's (overfilled upper pillars into color region); row 11 cols 4-5 as 8's instead of 1's; row 12 cols 0-3 as 1's instead of 8's? Expected has 1's there but generated 1's too—wait, row 12 generated 1's in 0-3, expected 1's; but row 14 cols 0-3 as 1's instead of 8's (underfilled orig pillars); bottom fill in rows 16-18 cols 5-12 as 8's? No, generated 4's but expected 4's—wait, differences in row 10-11 (generated 8's in cols 0-3/4-5 where expected 1's/8's mixed); row 12 cols 4-5 as 8's instead of 1's. Seems lower pairs wrong (max_group=0 limits to first group, missing later activations); upper pairs overfilled vertically past max_prop.
 * Train 3: Generated underfilled upper pillars, e.g., rows 4-6 cols 0-2/8-17 as 7's/3's instead of 8's (expected full 8's in row 4 cols 0-7? No, expected row 4 cols 0-2 7's, but row 5 cols 0-7/12-13/19-20 as 8's where generated 7's/8's partial); row 14 cols 5-19 as 7's instead of 8's (missed horizontal in has_prop row); bottom rows 16-18 cols 0-2 as 2's, 3-23 partial 4's/7's but expected 7's in col 0 then 4's from col 8, with col 3 as 7's not 8's. Pair linking/skipping buggy (e.g., color 4 with next 2 not handled for upper); lower fill start_col wrong (used pillar min instead of orig for color 2?); propagation didn't full-fill orig cols vertically.
 * compute_upper_pairs_with_gi is partially helpful but buggy (inconsistent pos==0/3 logic for pair_start, e.g., color 4 at pos 0 sets pair_start=start+1 if no link, but skips only if link; gi tracking good for right-fill). compute_lower_pairs calls compute_seed_pairs with max_group=0, which is broken (only processes first group, missing activations in later groups like gi=2/3; don't use as-is). apply_upper_right_fill uses deepcopy of original_g[6:25] for temp check, helpful for "empty" detection, but condition (pair_start == group_start+1) too strict and num_fill min(2, rows) may over/under; also, fills with 8's but only if all-bkg row found—useful but crashes if no original_g passed correctly. apply_lower_bottom_fill good for bottom empty detection (sort reverse for bottommost), but start_col logic (min pillar for 1, orig for 2) and num_rows (1 for 1, 2 for 2) not triggering right (e.g., first_color detection assumes get_clue_color(1) but may miss if pos!=0). Overall, main program structure (output = copy g[6:25], bkg, replace, compute pairs/cols, place pillars/prop, then fills) is helpful but order wrong (fills use post-placement grid, but temp uses pre—fix by calling fills after prop but adjust temp). Function compute_seed_pairs is unhelpful/broken for lower (wrong params; generalize but fix max_group to 4).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output provided (ERROR: invalid grid format, likely [] returned due to len(g)!=25 or len(g[0])!=24 check failing, or deepcopy/copy error in apply_upper_right_fill returning non-list-of-lists). This does not make sense or look correct—program should always return a valid 19x24 list-of-lists, even if empty placements. Without output, can't verify, but error suggests dimension handling broken (e.g., test input may not be exactly 25x24, or g[6:25] slicing fails). To handle test, relax input check (assume valid), ensure all functions modify/output in-place correctly, and add try-except for deepcopy; expected output likely similar to trains: partial 8 pillars from clues/orig, horizontal in has_prop rows, right-fills in specific empty zones preserving colors like 1/2/4/6/7.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored regions (numbers 1-9 representing blocks or blobs of color) on a background, with initial 8's acting as seeds or starting points for paths; the goal is to extend and connect these blocks using lines of 8's (likely representing wires, paths, or bridges) in horizontal and vertical directions, filling background areas to link specific blocks while preserving existing colors and avoiding overwriting non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks are connected components of the same color, identified via flood fill (excluding background and 8's); these must be detected accurately to determine which ones to connect (e.g., upper blocks extend upward, bottom block anchors lower connections).
 * 8's are the fill color for paths and should only overwrite background cells, not existing colors or other 8's; paths often form cross-like or H-shaped connections between left, middle (seed), and right blocks, with verticals spanning full heights or partial ranges and horizontals bridging gaps.
 * Background is typically the dominant color (e.g., 3 in ex1, 1 in ex2, 7 in ex3) at canvas[0][0], but 5's in input may be placeholders to replace with background; the canvas starts from row 5 of input, suggesting a header or metadata in top rows.
 * Seed (initial 8 position) determines the middle vertical path; upper blocks (above seed row) may need special extension (e.g., one row up for all, two rows for the leftmost), while bottom block (lowest center) anchors lower horizontals.
 * Connections are not symmetric: left vertical often spans from upper to lower, right from top to bottom or partial, middle from top to lower; horizontals include upper (near seed) from left to right, lower (near bottom) from left to edge, but must align precisely with block edges (e.g., starting after left block's right edge).
 * Subtle elements: Paths can create enclosed areas (e.g., full horizontal 8 lines in ex1 row 7-8 connecting left 1's to right 4's via middle); in ex2, a wide horizontal 8 bridge in row 2-3 spans almost the full width; in ex3, vertical 8's on left and right sides connect multiple levels, with a bottom horizontal bridge; avoid filling over existing blocks—e.g., don't overwrite the 4's in ex1 or 6's in ex3.
 * Handle varying grid sizes and block positions: blocks may not touch edges, seeds may be offset, and some connections skip rows/columns if blocked; ensure fills stop at grid bounds and don't create unintended loops.
 * The puzzle emphasizes precise alignment—e.g., in ex1, upper horizontal is only 2 rows high at seed level, lower is 2 rows near bottom; verticals must match block heights exactly for connections.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies blocks via flood fill and finds the seed, which is essential for locating connection points, but fails to produce correct outputs for all training examples due to incorrect fill positions and ranges.
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated has scattered 8's (e.g., top rows with partial 8's, vertical 8's only in middle cols 8-9 rows 8-10, no full horizontal bridge in rows 7-8); expected has full vertical 8's on left (cols 0-3 from row 3 down), middle (cols 8-9 full height), right (cols 16-17 partial), and horizontals connecting them (e.g., row 7-8 full 8's from col 0 to 21, lower partial); the program overfilled some backgrounds with original colors (e.g., row 0-1 has 5's instead of 3's) and missed the wide horizontal at seed level, likely due to wrong left_start/right_end calculations (set left_start=0 but no left block detected properly, right_start misaligned).
 * In training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated has minimal 8's (only cols 8-9 rows 9-10, some misplaced horizontals like row 0 partial 8's); expected has extensive 8 connections (e.g., horizontal full-width in rows 2-3 cols 4-21, verticals on left cols 4-5 full height, middle cols 8-9 partial, right cols 16-21 partial with wide bridge); program failed to detect side blocks accurately (e.g., left 2's and right 3's not positioned for full spans), resulting in no vertical fills from top to bottom and wrong upper/lower horizontal ranges (e.g., filled row 0 incorrectly with 8's over 5's).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated has almost no 8 extensions (only cols 12-13 rows 12-13, some bottom fills misplaced); expected has complex 8 paths (e.g., left vertical cols 3-4 from row 0 down to bottom, right cols 18-19 partial, multiple horizontals like row 4 full 8's cols 0-21, row 12-13 wide 8's); program incorrectly identified bottom block (likely as the 4's instead of central), leading to wrong lh1/lh2 (lower horizontal at rows 16-17 instead of varied), and extend_upper_blocks didn't trigger for upper 3's, missing upward extensions and side alignments (e.g., right_start set to -something invalid).
 * extend_upper_blocks partially works for extending leftmost upper block by 2 rows but fails to apply correctly (e.g., no extension seen in generated ex1 rows 3-4); get_bottom_block and get_side_blocks are conceptually helpful but buggy in selecting (e.g., compares tuples directly instead of indices, may pick wrong block if ties).
 * fill_vertical and fill_horizontal are useful and correctly only fill background, but called with wrong params (e.g., uh1/uh2 too narrow, left_start=0 but should be after block edge, right_end miscalculated as seed_j+1).
 * get_main_canvas works for skipping rows and replacing 5's, but in ex1 generated row 0-1 still has 5's (possible off-by-one in replacement loop).
 * Overall, the attempt understands block detection and basic filling but misses puzzle's connection logic (e.g., full-width horizontals at key levels, verticals tying to block min/max_i precisely); no unhelpful functions, but direct tuple comparison in get_side_blocks is broken (use key=lambda b: (b[2] + b[3])/2 consistently).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it only adds a small 3x3 block of 8's in rows 8-10, cols 8-10 (near the seed), with no other fills, leaving most background (9's) unfilled and blocks (top 2's, left 1's, bottom 4's, right 3's) unconnected.
 * Expected likely includes vertical 8's on left (cols 0-3 from row 7 down to connect 1's to bottom), middle (cols 8-10 full height from seed), right (cols 21-23 partial to connect 3's), and horizontals (e.g., upper near row 7 full from left to right, lower near bottom bridging 4's); the minimal 8's suggest the program detected the seed but failed to identify side/bottom blocks properly (e.g., right 3's in cols 21-23 not treated as right_block, no extension or fills triggered), and no upper extensions for the 9's block above.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as connections should link all major blocks (similar to training examples' H or cross patterns); the isolated 8's ignore the wide 9's in middle rows 4-18 and don't bridge to edges, probably due to same issues as training (wrong block selection and fill ranges).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes a 25x24 input grid (with clues in row 1 and a 19x24 working area starting from row 6) to output a completed 19x24 grid by identifying background colors, detecting and propagating special "8" elements (likely representing propagatable or filled areas), placing seed pairs of 8s based on clue groups in row 1, and applying conditional fills in upper/lower/right sections. The puzzle involves color-coded rules for activating and positioning pairs, handling "property" rows (those containing 8s), and ensuring background (bkg) cells are overwritten only under specific conditions, resembling a constrained paint-by-numbers or blob-filling puzzle with propagation mechanics.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bkg) is the most common non-0/5/8 color in the working grid (rows 6-24); 5s are always replaced by bkg early on, but 0s and 8s are preserved or used as seeds.
 * Clue row (g[1]) has 4 groups starting at columns 1,7,13,19 (each 4 cells wide); each group has a key color (first non-0/5 value) that determines activation and pair positioning—e.g., color 1 in lower context or 4/6 in pos 0 activates left-leaning pairs, 2/4/6 in pos 3 activates right-leaning pairs; color 3 is neutral/inactive.
 * Seed pairs are computed separately for "upper" (first 3 groups, max_group=3, is_lower=False) and "lower" (last group or subsets, max_group=1, is_lower=True); pairs are 2-cell adjacent 8s placed at specific offsets (e.g., +1, +2, +3 from group start) based on color/position, with special handling like pair_start=18 for last group if color=2.
 * "has_prop" rows are indices i (0-18 for output rows 0-18) where input row 6+i contains any 8; max_prop_i is the highest such i, dividing the grid into upper (0 to max_prop_i) and lower (max_prop_i+1 to 18) sections for pair placement—upper uses upper_pairs, lower uses lower_pairs; additionally, all has_prop rows get lower_pairs overlaid.
 * Propagation: In has_prop rows, fill all bkg cells between the min and max column with 8s (horizontal expansion); this must happen after initial placements but before some fills.
 * Upper right fill: Find the first all-bkg row (upper_block_start) from row 0; fill min(2, remaining rows) starting there, from the rightmost upper pair start to col 23 with 8s, but only if the rightmost pair is at group_start+1 (is_plus1=True).
 * Lower right fill: If first group color is 1 or 2, start fill at row 13 (for 2) or 14 (for 1), for 2 rows, from the leftmost lower pair start to col 23 with 8s.
 * Subtleties: Pair activation skips if color=3 or no key color; lower pairs may override upper in overlap; propagation can expand existing 8s but only fills bkg (not overwriting other colors like 1/2/4/6/7); all-bkg checks use temp_output to avoid interference from prior placements; grid must be exactly 19x24 output with valid ints (error if not); existing non-bkg colors (e.g., 1,2,4,6,7) in output are preserved and not overwritten by 8s.
 * Edge cases: No has_prop means max_prop_i=-1, so upper covers all; empty pairs skip placements; last group (col 19-22) has off-by-one adjustments (e.g., pair_end <24); if no count in bkg detection, default to 3.
 * Common misses: Over-propagating 8s into non-bkg areas; wrong pair offsets (e.g., assuming fixed positions); not separating upper/lower logic properly; fills applying unconditionally; failing to preserve existing colors like 1/2/4 in expected outputs.

(Helpful for horizontal 8 expansion; correctly targets only bkg between 8s; applied too late or not at all in some mismatches.)

```python
def is_all_bkg_row(row: List[int], bkg: int) -> bool:
    return all(cell == bkg for cell in row)
```
(Helpful for finding upper_block_start; used with temp_output to avoid placement interference—key subtlety.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented core structure (bkg detection, pair computation, has_prop detection, propagation, sectioned placements, conditional fills) but all training examples failed due to incorrect 8 placements and expansions.
 * Train 1: Correctly placed some upper pairs (e.g., 8s at cols 8-9 and 16-17 in rows 0-6) and lower pairs (e.g., cols 2-3 in rows 12-14), but failed to propagate 8s into cols 4-7 in rows 7-8 (generated 3s, expected 8s); over-placed 8s in row 6 cols 16-17 (should be 3s); wrong lower fill starting too early (cols 18-21 got 4s but no right-fill 8s); row 12 has extra 8s at 2-3 (not expected); propagation missed in row 14 (cols 4-23 should be 8s but partial).
 * Train 2: Partially correct upper pairs (e.g., 8s at 4-5,8-9 in early rows), but wrong in row 2 cols 13-19 (generated 1/8s, expected 8s across); lower section misplacements (e.g., row 10 has 8s at 4-15 but expected 1s at 4-7); row 12 has extra 8s at 0-3/20-23 (expected 1s); propagation failed in row 14 (cols 8-23 should be 8s); lower fill in rows 16-18 placed 8 at col 5 incorrectly (expected 1s there).
 * Train 3: Good initial pairs (e.g., 8s at 3-4,18-19 in rows 0-3), but failed upper propagation (rows 4-6 should have 8s at 8-17 but generated 7s/8s mismatched); row 6 has extra 8s at 0-3 (expected 7s); row 11 has 8s at 5-17 (expected partial); lower fill in rows 16-18 placed 8 at col 3 (expected 7); propagation in row 14 missed expanding to cols 20-23.
 * Pair logic worked partially (some expected 8 pairs match, like in train1 cols 8-9), but activation/offset rules are buggy (e.g., color=4 with next=2 not triggering +3 correctly; lower color=1 not always +3).
 * Section division via max_prop_i is helpful but misapplied—upper/lower placements overlap incorrectly, and has_prop overlay adds extras without checks.
 * Fills are over-aggressive: upper right applies even without is_plus1 in some cases; lower right uses wrong left_start (min pair instead of fixed).
 * Propagation is applied only to has_prop rows post-placement, but timing causes misses (e.g., needs re-propagation after fills?); doesn't handle vertical propagation.
 * Overall, preserves existing colors correctly (e.g., 1/2/4/6/7 not overwritten), but 8s overwrite bkg too selectively.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, though compute_seed_pairs has subtle bugs in offsets (e.g., for color=2 at end).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output provided—program errored with invalid format (<class 'list'>, likely returned [] or non-List[List[int]] due to early return if len(g)!=25 or len(g[0])!=24, suggesting test input didn't match expected dimensions).
 * Without output, cannot verify correctness, but based on training failures, it likely would mismatch: partial pairs/fills/propagation as seen in trains, potentially missing test-specific clues (e.g., unique color_pos or no has_prop). Test probably requires robust dimension check and default handling; error indicates lack of graceful fallbacks, making output unusable—does not look correct due to crash.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top rows define active colors and patterns, and the task is to transform the lower "base field" (rows 5-23) by identifying maroon (8) patches, extending them horizontally and vertically into pillars, filling connections between pillars while respecting active colors, clearing non-maroon elements below patches, and adding full horizontal connections in background areas to link to the bottom, ultimately outputting the first 19 rows of the modified grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The base field is always the lower 19 rows (g[5:24]), with borders (5's) replaced by background (3's) to simplify processing.
 * Active colors are unique non-0, non-5 values from rows 1-4 of the input grid; these must not be overwritten except where explicitly filling with 8's, and fills only occur on background (3) or non-active cells.
 * Maroon patches are contiguous horizontal sequences of 8's in the base field; the code assumes a single patch but should handle multiples via patch_infos list—subtlety: patches may shift after horizontal fills, so compute pillar positions post-fill.
 * Horizontal fills extend 8's left/right from each patch until hitting an active color or edge, but only at the patch row itself.
 * Pillars: Upper pillars (above patch) include left pillar (aligned to extended left), patch pillar, and right pillar (aligned to extended right); for the row immediately above the patch, add a full fill between the outermost pillars if background. Lower pillars (below patch) only include left and patch pillars, without right or full fills, and extend down fully.
 * Clearing below patch: Starting from the row after the patch, replace all active colors (except 8's) with 3's to remove obstructions, but preserve any existing 8's or background.
 * Full connections below: In rows sufficiently below the patch (e.g., after 2-3 pillar rows), if a row segment from left pillar start to near-right edge is all background (3's), fill it entirely with 8's to create horizontal links; leave space at bottom edges and avoid overfilling near active areas.
 * Subtle elements: Pillar widths must match the original patch width for alignment (e.g., right_pillar_left = right_end - patch_width + 1); upper fills may need to handle varying active interferences per row; lower sections often end with pattern-specific bars or fills (e.g., full 8 rows or color bars) that aren't cleared/overwritten; multiple patches require independent processing without interference; the output must exactly match expected row-by-row, including preserving top patterns like 1's, 2's, 4's in specific positions.
 * Edge cases: Patches may be off-center; active colors in lower rows block fills but aren't cleared until after pillar application; bottom 2-3 rows often preserve input patterns (e.g., color bars) without 8 fills; if no patches, return unmodified base field (but all examples have patches).
 * General: Grid width is 24 columns; deepcopy to avoid mutating input; process upper/lower separately after horizontal fills; avoid filling active colors or beyond grid edges.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and extracts the base field, replaces 5's with 3's, and gets active colors from top rows, which works across all examples as a solid foundation.
 * Horizontal fills at patch rows are mostly correct (e.g., extends 8's properly in train 1 and 2), but in train 3, it overextends or misaligns due to pre-existing actives like 7's blocking partially.
 * Pillar computation post-fill is helpful but buggy: in train 1, it sets left_pillar incorrectly, leading to no left pillar in upper rows (generated has empty left in rows 0-3, but expected has 1's preserved and no extra 8's there); upper pillars apply patch and right but miss full left+fill in immediate above row, resulting in row 4 having 1's instead of full 8's connection.
 * Lower pillars in train 1 apply left and patch correctly but fail to preserve expected 1's in rows 9-11 (generated clears to 3's and adds unnecessary 8's in right, but expected keeps 1's and shifts to 3's/4's); clearing active below works partially but over-clears preserved patterns like the 1's bar.
 * In train 2, upper pillars overfill row 0 with 1's into 8's (generated row 0 has 1's overwritten, but expected preserves them); horizontal fills miss the full right extension in rows 2-3 (generated has partial 8's, expected full 8's across right); lower clearing removes too much, turning expected 1's/3's into 8's in rows 12-16, and full connections below are absent or mistimed (no full 8's in rows 14-15 as expected).
 * Train 3 generated mismatches heavily: upper rows 0-3 have 7's preserved but no 8 extensions into them (expected has 8's starting row 0); patch at row 4-7 fills incorrectly, adding extra 8's in left/right where 7's should block; lower pillars extend wrong (e.g., row 8 has 2's overwritten partially, expected preserves 2's left); full connections below are missing (rows 14-16 should have more 8's connecting 7's, but generated has gaps); bottom rows 17-18 clear 4's incorrectly to 3's/8's, but expected keeps 4's bar.
 * add_full_connections_below is unhelpful/broken: arbitrary start_r= patch_r+3 and checks only partial width (left_start to width-3), leading to no fills in train 1 (expected full 8's in row 14), partial in train 2, and none in train 3; it ignores active interferences and bottom preservation.
 * clear_active_below_patch over-applies, removing expected active patterns below (e.g., 1's in train 1 row 9-11, 1's in train 2 rows 12-18, 7's/4's in train 3 rows 16-18); it should skip certain bottom rows or only clear non-connector actives.
 * apply_upper_pillars has logic for immediate above full fill but miscalculates min_fill/max_fill bounds (e.g., in train 1, it fills too narrowly, missing connection to 4's); it also applies to all upper rows including where actives like 1's block, but doesn't preserve them properly.
 * apply_lower_pillars misses right pillar in some cases and doesn't handle multiple patches; in train 2, it adds extra 8's in row 16-17 where expected has 1's/4's.
 * Overall, the single-patch assumption works for these but may fail multiples; deepcopy is good but excessive copies slow it; no handling for patch row variations (e.g., train 1 patch at row 7, train 2 at row 3, train 3 at row 0? wait, base indexing).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it starts with a top row of partial 8's but then has full 2's bars in rows 1-3 (likely from uncleared input patterns), which shouldn't be overwritten unless part of pillars, but expected likely needs 8 extensions into them based on patch at row 4.
 * Rows 4-6 show 9's preserved around central 8's patch, but horizontal fills seem incomplete (no extension left/right beyond 9's, whereas expected should fill to edges or actives); upper pillars in row 7-8 incorrectly overwrite 1's/9's with 8's without full connection.
 * Lower sections (rows 9-18) have repetitive 8's pillars but overextend into 9's areas without blocking, and row 18 has a weird partial 8's/3's mix with 9's, suggesting clearing failed to remove actives properly while missing full horizontal connections below (expected probably has full 8's links in background rows and preserves bottom 9's bar).
 * No full connections added below (e.g., rows 14-17 are pillar-only, but test likely needs horizontal 8's in all-3 segments to connect to bottom 9's); the output ignores active 9's blocking, leading to overfills, and bottom row 18 doesn't match typical bar preservation seen in training (e.g., no clean 9's bar).
 * Overall, it partially captures pillars but fails on preservation, blocking, and connections, making it incoherent compared to training expectations—e.g., too many 8's in right columns without justification, and missing upper connections.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where starting points (indicated by specific colors in a pattern row) need to be connected to target regions (blobs or blocks of matching colors) in the main puzzle area using a consistent connector color (likely 8, representing paths or wires). The connections appear to form thick (width 2) vertical paths from the top down to the target's level, followed by horizontal connections across the target, but only overwriting background cells, with the goal of matching exact expected grid outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid has a structured layout: rows 0-5 seem to be headers/borders (e.g., row 1 is the pattern row for starts), main puzzle is rows 6-24 (19 rows), and the output should modify only the main area while preserving non-background cells.
 * Background is the most common color in the main grid (often 3 or 1 across examples), and paths (color 8) should only overwrite background cells, never existing objects or targets.
 * Starts are parsed from row 1 (g[1]): non-zero, non-5 values indicate (column, target_color) pairs; multiple starts may exist, each needing independent connections.
 * Targets are bounding boxes of cells matching the start's target_color; if not found, skip. Connections are vertical (thickness 2, in start column s and s+1) from row 0 down to the target's max_r (bottom row), then a single horizontal line at max_r across the target's min_c to max_c.
 * Subtle elements: Vertical paths start from the top (row 0) but may need to stop or adjust at the target's top if overlapping; thickness is always 2 columns wide, but if s+1 exceeds width, it falls back to s (potential edge case bug). Horizontals are only at the bottom of the target, not the top or sides. Paths do not extend below the target or connect multiple targets incorrectly. Existing structures (e.g., blocks of 1,2,4) must remain unchanged except where background is filled. In some cases, verticals appear to "hug" the left or right of targets, and horizontals may need to extend beyond the bounding box or connect at different rows. Overfilling (e.g., painting over non-background) or wrong column selection breaks matches. Edge cases: targets spanning full height/width, multiple overlapping starts/targets, or backgrounds varying per example (3 in ex1, 1 in ex2/ex3/test). No diagonal or curved paths—strictly axis-aligned. Preserve all non-path elements exactly.

            max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
- `fill_vertical` and `fill_horizontal`: These implement the filling logic but are buggy—vertical fill uses a strided loop (k * w) which works but overfills if not clipped properly; horizontal is row-contiguous but both fail to handle cases where paths should stop at target's min_r or adjust for existing non-background cells in the path. They also assume thickness 2 blindly, leading to overflows or wrong positions. The single-loop optimization is inefficient/unnecessary and complicates debugging; better to use nested loops for clarity. Overall, the logic (vertical to bottom + horizontal at bottom) is incorrect for the puzzle's varying connection styles.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed to match expected outputs, indicating partial understanding: starts and targets are detected correctly (e.g., colors like 4 in ex1, 6/3 in ex2, 3/6/4 in ex3), background identified right (3 in ex1, 1 in ex2/ex3), but path drawing is wrong.
 * Train 1: Generated vertical 8's in columns 1-2 from top to ~row 10, plus misplaced 8's in mid-grid (e.g., rows 7-8 cols 8-9) and bottom horizontals too narrow/wrong position; expected has verticals hugging the right side of the 1-block (cols 8-9), full horizontal 8's across rows 7-8 cols 4-17 connecting to 4's, and extended 8's in rows 14-15 cols 4-21. Missed thickening horizontals to full blocks in some areas and vertical extensions below targets; overpainted some 3's as 8's incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated scattered 8's in cols 4-5 and 7-8 from top, with incomplete horizontals (e.g., row 2 cols 13-20 as 1's instead of 8's) and wrong verticals in row 10 (cols 8-9 as 8's but expected 1's); expected has paired 8's in cols 4-5 and 8-9, full horizontal 8-block in rows 2-3 cols 13-20, vertical 8's only to target's level in some places, and no overpainting of 3's or 6's. Mismatch in connection thickness and horizontal span (generated too spotty, missed full 8-block for the middle target).
 * Train 3: Generated vertical 8's in cols 4-5 and 7-8 from top, with extra 8's in row 4 cols 8-9 (overpainting 3's) and misplaced horizontals (e.g., row 11 cols 12-13 as 8's but expected 7's); expected has asymmetric verticals (e.g., cols 3-4 for first, then full 8-blocks in rows 4-5 and 11-12), horizontals at multiple levels (e.g., row 4 full across 0-19), and verticals stopping at target tops or extending precisely. Overfilled backgrounds and wrong column pairs (e.g., used s and s+1 blindly, but expected shifts like col 3 for start at ?).
 * General issues: Program assumes fixed vertical drop to target's bottom + horizontal only at bottom, but expected shows variable connection points (e.g., horizontals at target's top/mid in ex1/ex3, verticals not always thickness 2 or from absolute top). No handling for multiple targets per color or overlapping paths. Edge handling weak (e.g., s+1 overflow in narrow grids). extract_main_grid and find_target_box worked well (bounding boxes match implied targets), but filling logic is core failure—paths seem to "reach" the target side (left/right) rather than always bottom.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows vertical 8's only in cols 1-2 from rows 3-16 (too narrow, wrong position—likely from a single start at col 1?), with horizontals at row 13 cols 9-21 and row 17 cols 7-16 (spotty and misplaced), overpainting some 9's as 8's (e.g., row 7 col 9) and leaving most 9-block unfilled. Expected likely needs paired 8's hugging the 9-block's sides (e.g., cols 3-4 and 10-11 vertical from top to target's bottom ~row 17, full horizontal 8's across the 9's at bottom row 17 cols 3-21, and no changes to top 2's or bottom 4's). Background seems 3 (right side), but 9's are targets (probably from starts in row 1 matching 9), and generated misses connecting to the large 9-block properly—looks like partial vertical from wrong start column, incomplete horizontals, and no thickness 2 consistency. This suggests the program's s/s+1 vertical assumption fails here (test may have start at col 0 or multiple, requiring adjusted columns), and it over-relies on bottom-only horizontals without side connections.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle involving a 25x24 input grid (with clues in early rows) where the goal is to process and modify the lower 19 rows of a scene by detecting background colors, interpreting clue groups to place or extend "8" values (likely representing props, fills, or extensions), handling special pairing rules for upper and lower sections, and applying propagation rules like vertical/horizontal extensions and fills based on prop positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection: Identify the most common non-special (non-0,5,8) value in the output grid as background (bkg), then replace all 5's with it; this works but may fail if ties or special cases alter counts.
 * Clue interpretation: Clues in row 1 are divided into 4 groups of 4 cells (starts at 1,7,13,19); extract color (first non-0/5 value) and position (offset 0-3) per group using get_group_info; colors like 1-6 trigger specific activations for pairs or fills, with skips for certain combinations (e.g., color 4 with next 2 skips next group).
 * Upper pairs: For rows 0 to max_prop_row (where props=8 exist), place horizontal pairs of 8's in bkg areas based on clue activations (e.g., pos=0 with color 4/6 starts pair at +1 or +3; pos=3 with 2/4/6 adjusts start); includes skip logic for chained activations.
 * Lower pairs/special: For rows 16+ or prop rows, similar but limited (e.g., only for first group color=1 at pos=0 or color=4 at pos=3); special handling if first color=1/2 for left-to-right fills in rows 14-15 starting from min pair/col positions.
 * Prop propagation: For each column with original 8's, extend 8's upward from min_row and downward from max_row into adjacent bkg cells until non-bkg; also horizontal fill between min/max 8-cols in prop rows and specific rows (14,15).
 * Rightmost upper block fill: If rightmost upper pair starts at group_start+1, find first all-bkg upper row and fill rightward from pair start for up to 2 rows.
 * Subtleties: Max_prop_i limits upper fills to before last prop row; orig_min/max_row track original 8 positions before modifications; horizontal fills only in bkg gaps within 8-col ranges; potential overfill in chains (e.g., color 4+next2 skips but still pairs); lower fills start from 16 but may apply earlier in prop rows; entire rows 14-15 get rightward fills if first color=1/2, but only from left_fill_start.
 * Easy to miss: Pair positions must be <24 and +1 valid; for last group (start=19), pos=3 pair_start=18; vertical extensions stop at non-bkg; background count excludes 0/5/8 but defaults to 3 if empty; prop rows (with any 8) trigger extra horizontal fills.
 * Grid format: Output must be exactly 19x24 List[List[int]], no errors; input validation checks len(g)=25 and len(row)=24.

(This computes upper pair positions with skip logic; partially works but misses some activations or placements.)

```python
# Vertical/horizontal extension logic (from main program)
orig_min_row = {j: 19 for j in range(24)}
orig_max_row = {j: -1 for j in range(24)}
for i in range(19):
    for j in range(24):
        if g[6 + i][j] == 8:  # Original props
            orig_min_row[j] = min(orig_min_row[j], i)
            orig_max_row[j] = max(orig_max_row[j], i)
for j in range(24):
    if orig_max_row[j] >= 0:
        min_i = orig_min_row[j]
        for k in range(min_i - 1, -1, -1):
            if output[k][j] == bkg:
                output[k][j] = 8
            else:
                break
        max_i = orig_max_row[j]
        for k in range(max_i + 1, 19):
            if output[k][j] == bkg:
                output[k][j] = 8
            else:
                break
```
(This tracks original 8 positions and extends vertically into bkg; helpful for propagation but applied too late or without originals preserved.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1: Fully correct, indicating core background replacement, basic pair placement in upper rows, and some extensions work well for simple cases.
 * Train 2: Incorrect; generated misses rightward 8-fills in rows 2-3 (positions 16-23 should be 8's but are 1's/bkg); row 4 has correct partial but expected has more 8's in 16-23? No, row 4 matches expected in provided snippet, but row 2-3 differ (generated has isolated 8-pairs without full row fill); lower rows 14-15 have correct 8-fills, but upper prop extensions incomplete; likely upper pair logic or block fill misses chaining to full rows.
 * Train 2: Rows 0-1 match expected (6's in 13-17); but rows 2-4 show partial pairs (e.g., 13-15 as 1's in generated row 2 vs 8's in expected); horizontal fills in prop rows (e.g., row 8-9) match, but vertical upward from props doesn't fully propagate to upper empty areas.
 * Train 3: Incorrect; major differences in upper-mid rows—e.g., row 4 generated has 7's in 0-7/15-17 where expected has full 8's across 0-14; row 5-6 generated has isolated 7's vs expected full 8's in 0-14; row 14 generated has 7's in 15-19 vs expected 7's only partial; suggests upper pair activations or bkg checks fail, leading to no fills in wide areas; lower rows 16-18 match expected 4's and 7's.
 * Train 3: Row 0-2 match; row 3 partial (20-23=7's vs 6's? No, expected row 3 has 6's in 20-23, generated matches); but row 4-6 over-rely on bkg without placing wide 8-blocks from clues; horizontal fills in row 7+ partial but miss left extensions; vertical extensions apply but don't cover full widths.
 * General: compute_lower_pairs and special lower_pair_for_special partially work (e.g., Train 2 rows 16+ correct), but range for lower fills is wrong (hardcoded 16 to 16? Typo in code: range(max_prop_i +1 if ... else 16, 16) is empty); upper_pairs_with_skip handles skips but misses some pos=0/3 cases or rightmost adjustments; rightmost block fill activates but num_rows= min(2, ...) may underfill; first_color=1/2 left_fill_start min() works but overfills if orig_min_col wrong; orig_min/max_row computed before some fills, so misses propagated 8's; prop row horizontal fills apply but only after pairs, causing gaps.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The lower_pairs range loop is broken (range(a,16) with a>=16 does nothing); upper block fill assumes max_prop_i but may not find upper_block_start correctly if no all-bkg row; entire program returns output but test errors on format (likely due to g[6:25] slicing if input invalid, or empty return on len check).

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an ERROR: "Program returned invalid grid format: <class 'list'>", indicating the function returned a flat list instead of List[List[int]]; this suggests a bug in output construction (e.g., slicing g[6:25] failed or row[:] copied wrong, or early return [] flattened somehow).
 * No actual grid generated, so cannot verify correctness; likely the input grid doesn't meet len=25x24, triggering empty return, but error message implies type mismatch rather than empty—program understanding is incomplete for edge cases like invalid inputs.
 * Without output, it doesn't make sense; fix validation/output copy first, then check if pairs/fills apply similarly to trains (e.g., expect bkg replacements and 8-extensions based on clues, but unknown without test input details).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
