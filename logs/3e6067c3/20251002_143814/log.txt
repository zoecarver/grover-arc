=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 14:38:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 14:55:08] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style polyomino puzzle on a grid, where 1s represent walls or barriers, 8s are background/empty space, and scattered numbers (2-9) in the grid and possibly a clue row at the bottom indicate the required size of connected polyomino regions (orthogonally adjacent cells of the same number must form exactly N cells for a clue N). The task is to resolve and fill ambiguous or partial regions by expanding/connecting same-number cells into complete polyominoes of the exact size, without overlapping walls or background, while leaving walls, background, and the clue row unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are bounded by 1s (walls) and 8s (background); fillings must stay within these enclosures and cannot cross them—treat 1s and 8s as impassable.
 * Each number N must form exactly one or more polyominoes of size exactly N; cells with the same N must connect orthogonally (up/down/left/right, no diagonals) to form these shapes, and no polyomino can be larger or smaller than N.
 * Partial clues (single N cells) need to be expanded by claiming adjacent empty cells (non-1, non-8) to reach size N; if multiple possible expansions, resolve based on fitting all clues without conflict (e.g., don't overclaim space needed for another number).
 * The bottom row (e.g., [8, 2, 8, 3, ...]) acts as a fixed clue legend or seed row—do not modify it; it provides initial N placements that must be expanded upward into the grid.
 * Subtle: Some regions may have multiple clues of the same N, requiring multiple separate polyominoes of size N; avoid merging different Ns or same N across walls. Empty regions without clues might remain 8s or need inference from fitting.
 * Overlapping possibilities: If a region has space for multiple polyominoes, prioritize exact fits; e.g., a clue 7 in a larger space might need to snake or L-shape to fill exactly 7 cells without leaving orphans.
 * Edge cases: Thin corridors (e.g., 1-cell wide) limit shapes; vertical/horizontal stretches must match sizes (e.g., a 2x2 block for 4, not a 1x4 line if it doesn't fit clues). Background 8s in regions might be "empty" but can be filled if needed for polyominoes.
 * All training examples show the bottom clue row unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming it's fixed. Grids vary in width (20, 20, 27 cols across examples), so handle variable dimensions.
 * No diagonals for connectivity; only 4-directional adjacency.
 * If a region has no clues, leave as 8s; if overconstrained (impossible fit), but assuming inputs are solvable.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single prior program used flood-fill on non-background/non-wall cells to identify components, then applied rules like filling with "minority color" if no 1s or filling non-1 cells with the other color if 1s present—but this misinterprets the puzzle as color-based merging rather than size-constrained polyomino expansion.
 * Worked: Correctly detected some connected components (e.g., in Train 1, it kept existing 2s,5s,7s in place without overwriting clues); identified walls (1s) and background (8s) accurately; preserved the bottom clue row unchanged.
 * Didn't work: Ignored polyomino size rules entirely—e.g., filled entire components with one number regardless of size (overfilling 7s as just two cells instead of expanding to seven); treated 1s as "walls to fill around" but didn't use them as boundaries for exact N-shapes; minority/majority logic led to arbitrary fills (e.g., Train 1 row 2 kept 7s as two cells, missing extension to [7,7,7,7,7,7? wait no, expected has three 7s in middle and three on right, but generated only two each).
 * Train 1 differences: Generated missed vertical extensions (e.g., rows 6-8 should have 2s in cols 2-3 and 6s in cols 16-17, but output has all 8s there); row 10 has 3s only in two cells but expected extends to six 3s (cols 1-6); row 14 all 8s/1s but expected has 9s in cols 8-9 and 2s in 16-17; unknown why it didn't expand from bottom clues upward.
 * Train 2 differences: Generated left many areas as 1s or unchanged, e.g., row 2 has 2 and 3 isolated but expected connects 2s across (cols 2 and 4); row 4 all 8s but expected has 3 in col 6; row 6 has 7 and 4 isolated but expected connects 4s (cols 6-8? wait, cols 6 and 8 for 4); row 5 has 3 in col 6 but generated empty; failed to expand bottom clues (e.g., 3,4,6 into vertical polyominoes).
 * Train 3 differences: Similar isolation issues—e.g., row 3 has 3,2,9 as singles but expected expands 3 to cols 3-6 (four 3s?), 2 to cols 11-15 (five 2s?), 9 unchanged? Wait, expected has 3s in 3-6 and 3s in 7-9? No, row 3 expected: 3 at col3, then 1s, but actually expands horizontally/vertically; generated missed most expansions (e.g., row 9 has 6 and 4 isolated, expected connects 6s? and 4s in cols 14-18); rows 13-17 all 8s/6? but generated empty, expected has vertical 6s in col11; bottom expansions ignored entirely.
 * extract_regions (from the program) is helpful for finding bounded areas but broken for polyomino logic—needs integration with clue sizes (don't use raw minority fill). No other functions in the attempt; color_count logic is unhelpful/irrelevant (puzzle isn't about colors, but numbers as sizes—discard it).
 * Overall: Attempt shows basic component detection but zero grasp of Fillomino rules (no size enforcement, no expansion from clues), leading to underfilled grids; bottom clues not propagated upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills large rectangular blocks without respecting polyomino sizes (e.g., rows 1-6 have a 5x6 block of 4s, which is 30 cells, but if seeded from a single 4 clue, it should be exactly 4 cells, not 30; similarly, 5-row 9s block is 25 cells, way over size 9). 
 * It treats entire row-spanning areas as single fills (e.g., cols 8-12 as 8s across multiple rows, but 8 is background—should not fill with 8 if claiming for polyominoes; expected likely has smaller, connected shapes like 4-cell 4s snaking around 1s). 
 * Bottom row clues (e.g., 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) are unchanged (good), but no upward expansion visible (e.g., col1 has 4 in bottom, but above it rows 15-20 have 9s/4s/5s/3s, not connected to bottom 4). 
 * Borders of 1s are preserved, but inner empties (implied 8s?) are wrongly uniform-filled, ignoring exact N sizes—e.g., a 5x5 block of 5s would be 25 cells, not size 5; this mismatches Fillomino, where shapes must be exactly N connected cells per clue. 
 * Unknown why it filled with 8s in some blocks (e.g., cols 8-12), as 8 is background—perhaps mistaking empty regions, but expected should fill with numbers from nearby clues or leave empty only if no fit. Overall, it looks like crude region painting, not size-aware polyominoes; to fix, start from each clue position and grow exactly N cells using BFS/possible shapes, resolving conflicts by backtracking or deduction.

[2025-10-02 14:55:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 15:22:26] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a 2D array of integers representing colors or fills (1 likely as background/white, 2+ as colored regions, 8 as unknowns/blanks to be resolved, and other numbers like 3-9 as special markers or obstacles). The goal is to transform the grid by applying rules to fill or adjust 8's and possibly other elements based on patterns like bounded regions or connections, ensuring consistency across rows and potentially columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 8's should be filled only if they form internal sequences bounded by the same non-8 color (e.g., >1) on both sides within a row, treating them as part of an extending colored region; however, boundaries must handle edges carefully to avoid assuming a default color like 0.
 * Index bounds are critical: when scanning for left/right non-8 bounds around 8-sequences, the code must prevent out-of-range access (e.g., l < 0 or r >= n), which caused crashes; use safe checks like if l >= 0 before accessing row[l].
 * The puzzle likely involves row-wise processing first, but may require column-wise or global consistency checks, as the grid shows symmetric or repeating patterns (e.g., 2-regions with embedded numbers like 4,6,9 that might act as "seeds" or fixed points not to overwrite).
 * Subtle elements: Embedded numbers (3-9) in colored regions (e.g., 2's) should remain unchanged unless rules specify merging; all-1 rows suggest background filling, but over-filling (e.g., turning everything to 1) ignores colored blobs. 8's might only fill if bounds are strictly same and non-background (not 1). Training errors indicate the need for robust edge cases, like 8's at row starts/ends or isolated 8's.
 * Global considerations: The grid has vertical symmetry and repeating 2-blob structures with varying embedded numbers (e.g., row 3 has 4 and 9 in 2's, row 10 has 6,7,4,9); rules might propagate fills vertically or match patterns across the grid. Deepcopy is useful to avoid mutating input, but ensure the function returns a modified copy.
 * Potential misses: Not handling cases where 8's are adjacent to 1's (background) without a matching bound; ignoring vertical influences (e.g., 8 in row 4 might align with patterns above/below); assuming left_c/right_c >1 without verifying they are actual colors (1 might be invalid for filling).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def fill_eights_between_same_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Fills sequences of 8's in each row if they are bounded by the same non-8 color on both sides.

    """

    for r in range(len(g)):
        row = g[r]
        i = 0
        n = len(row)
        while i < n:
            if row[i] != 8:
                i += 1
                continue
            start = i
            while i < n and row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            # Find left bounding non-8 (safer version needed)
            l = start - 1
            while l >= 0 and row[l] == 8:
                l -= 1
            left_c = row[l] if l >= 0 else 0  # 0 as edge sentinel
            # Find right bounding non-8 (safer version needed)
            r = end + 1
            while r < n and row[r] == 8:
                r += 1
            right_c = row[r] if r < n else 0  # 0 as edge sentinel
            if left_c == right_c and left_c > 1:  # >1 to exclude background 1
                for k in range(start, end + 1):
                    row[k] = left_c
        g[r] = row
    return g
```
(Note: This function is conceptually helpful for row-wise 8-filling but is currently broken due to potential index errors in bound finding; it could be fixed with better sentinels or conditional access. No other types/tools from attempts, as this is the primary one.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on filling internal 8-sequences in rows bounded by matching colors >1, which aligns with a core rule for resolving blanks in colored regions.
 * What worked: Successfully deepcopy'd the grid to avoid mutation; generated a partial output for the test input without crashing it (unlike training); correctly skipped non-8 cells and identified sequences.
 * What didn't work: Caused "list assignment index out of range" errors in all three training examples, likely due to unsafe access when l < 0 or r >= n during bound finding (e.g., row[l] or row[r] without checks); in test, it failed to fill the 8 in row 4 (position 3: [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]) because left bound (1) != right bound (1? but interrupted by 9), leaving 8 unchanged and not propagating any fills; over-filled some rows to all 1's? Wait, no—the output shows mostly unchanged rows with 8 intact, suggesting the filling condition never triggered properly.
 * The program function simply wraps the fill_eights, which is minimal but doesn't address vertical or multi-pass rules, missing broader puzzle elements like connecting 2-blobs vertically.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., blobs or regions) was attempted, which might be essential for identifying bounded areas globally; this attempt assumes purely row-local rules, ignoring potential column interactions.
 * Training mismatches: All errored out, so no validation; unknown why index errors occurred (possibly training grids have 8's at edges without sentinels), but it demonstrates lack of robustness.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It largely mirrors the input grid (assuming standard input has similar structure), with the 8 in row 4 (0-indexed) remaining unfilled (output shows [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]), and embedded numbers like 9,4,7 unchanged, but no evident filling of 8's despite the rule intent—suggesting the bounding condition failed (left of 8 is 1, right is 1 but with 9 nearby, possibly not matching strictly).
 * Many rows are output as repeating 1's or partial 2-blobs (e.g., row 1: [1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,...] unchanged), which might be correct if no 8's to fill, but the all-1 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,7) look like background preservation; however, later rows like 15-19 show 2-blobs with embedded 9,4,5,3 which remain, indicating no overwriting happened.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should resolve the 8 to match surrounding pattern (e.g., fill to 1 or extend a color, but based on rules, possibly to 4 if bounded by 4's—though here bounds are 1's); instead, 8 persists, and no vertical consistency (e.g., row 27 mirrors row 4 with 8 and 9's unfilled). This doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as 8's are unresolved blanks; it seems like the code ran but skipped filling due to mismatched bounds or bugs.

[2025-10-02 15:22:26] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style polyomino puzzle on a grid, where 1s represent walls or barriers, 8s are background/empty space, and scattered numbers (2-9) in the grid and possibly a clue row at the bottom indicate the required size of connected polyomino regions (orthogonally adjacent cells of the same number must form exactly N cells for a clue N). The task is to resolve and fill ambiguous or partial regions by expanding/connecting same-number cells into complete polyominoes of the exact size, without overlapping walls or background, while leaving walls, background, and the clue row unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are bounded by 1s (walls) and 8s (background); fillings must stay within these enclosures and cannot cross them—treat 1s and 8s as impassable.
 * Each number N must form exactly one or more polyominoes of size exactly N; cells with the same N must connect orthogonally (up/down/left/right, no diagonals) to form these shapes, and no polyomino can be larger or smaller than N.
 * Partial clues (single N cells) need to be expanded by claiming adjacent empty cells (non-1, non-8) to reach size N; if multiple possible expansions, resolve based on fitting all clues without conflict (e.g., don't overclaim space needed for another number).
 * The bottom row (e.g., [8, 2, 8, 3, ...]) acts as a fixed clue legend or seed row—do not modify it; it provides initial N placements that must be expanded upward into the grid.
 * Subtle: Some regions may have multiple clues of the same N, requiring multiple separate polyominoes of size N; avoid merging different Ns or same N across walls. Empty regions without clues might remain 8s or need inference from fitting.
 * Overlapping possibilities: If a region has space for multiple polyominoes, prioritize exact fits; e.g., a clue 7 in a larger space might need to snake or L-shape to fill exactly 7 cells without leaving orphans.
 * Edge cases: Thin corridors (e.g., 1-cell wide) limit shapes; vertical/horizontal stretches must match sizes (e.g., a 2x2 block for 4, not a 1x4 line if it doesn't fit clues). Background 8s in regions might be "empty" but can be filled if needed for polyominoes.
 * All training examples show the bottom clue row unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming it's fixed. Grids vary in width (20, 20, 27 cols across examples), so handle variable dimensions.
 * No diagonals for connectivity; only 4-directional adjacency.
 * If a region has no clues, leave as 8s; if overconstrained (impossible fit), but assuming inputs are solvable.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single prior program used flood-fill on non-background/non-wall cells to identify components, then applied rules like filling with "minority color" if no 1s or filling non-1 cells with the other color if 1s present—but this misinterprets the puzzle as color-based merging rather than size-constrained polyomino expansion.
 * Worked: Correctly detected some connected components (e.g., in Train 1, it kept existing 2s,5s,7s in place without overwriting clues); identified walls (1s) and background (8s) accurately; preserved the bottom clue row unchanged.
 * Didn't work: Ignored polyomino size rules entirely—e.g., filled entire components with one number regardless of size (overfilling 7s as just two cells instead of expanding to seven); treated 1s as "walls to fill around" but didn't use them as boundaries for exact N-shapes; minority/majority logic led to arbitrary fills (e.g., Train 1 row 2 kept 7s as two cells, missing extension to [7,7,7,7,7,7? wait no, expected has three 7s in middle and three on right, but generated only two each).
 * Train 1 differences: Generated missed vertical extensions (e.g., rows 6-8 should have 2s in cols 2-3 and 6s in cols 16-17, but output has all 8s there); row 10 has 3s only in two cells but expected extends to six 3s (cols 1-6); row 14 all 8s/1s but expected has 9s in cols 8-9 and 2s in 16-17; unknown why it didn't expand from bottom clues upward.
 * Train 2 differences: Generated left many areas as 1s or unchanged, e.g., row 2 has 2 and 3 isolated but expected connects 2s across (cols 2 and 4); row 4 all 8s but expected has 3 in col 6; row 6 has 7 and 4 isolated but expected connects 4s (cols 6-8? wait, cols 6 and 8 for 4); row 5 has 3 in col 6 but generated empty; failed to expand bottom clues (e.g., 3,4,6 into vertical polyominoes).
 * Train 3 differences: Similar isolation issues—e.g., row 3 has 3,2,9 as singles but expected expands 3 to cols 3-6 (four 3s?), 2 to cols 11-15 (five 2s?), 9 unchanged? Wait, expected has 3s in 3-6 and 3s in 7-9? No, row 3 expected: 3 at col3, then 1s, but actually expands horizontally/vertically; generated missed most expansions (e.g., row 9 has 6 and 4 isolated, expected connects 6s? and 4s in cols 14-18); rows 13-17 all 8s/6? but generated empty, expected has vertical 6s in col11; bottom expansions ignored entirely.
 * extract_regions (from the program) is helpful for finding bounded areas but broken for polyomino logic—needs integration with clue sizes (don't use raw minority fill). No other functions in the attempt; color_count logic is unhelpful/irrelevant (puzzle isn't about colors, but numbers as sizes—discard it).
 * Overall: Attempt shows basic component detection but zero grasp of Fillomino rules (no size enforcement, no expansion from clues), leading to underfilled grids; bottom clues not propagated upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills large rectangular blocks without respecting polyomino sizes (e.g., rows 1-6 have a 5x6 block of 4s, which is 30 cells, but if seeded from a single 4 clue, it should be exactly 4 cells, not 30; similarly, 5-row 9s block is 25 cells, way over size 9). 
 * It treats entire row-spanning areas as single fills (e.g., cols 8-12 as 8s across multiple rows, but 8 is background—should not fill with 8 if claiming for polyominoes; expected likely has smaller, connected shapes like 4-cell 4s snaking around 1s). 
 * Bottom row clues (e.g., 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) are unchanged (good), but no upward expansion visible (e.g., col1 has 4 in bottom, but above it rows 15-20 have 9s/4s/5s/3s, not connected to bottom 4). 
 * Borders of 1s are preserved, but inner empties (implied 8s?) are wrongly uniform-filled, ignoring exact N sizes—e.g., a 5x5 block of 5s would be 25 cells, not size 5; this mismatches Fillomino, where shapes must be exactly N connected cells per clue. 
 * Unknown why it filled with 8s in some blocks (e.g., cols 8-12), as 8 is background—perhaps mistaking empty regions, but expected should fill with numbers from nearby clues or leave empty only if no fit. Overall, it looks like crude region painting, not size-aware polyominoes; to fix, start from each clue position and grow exactly N cells using BFS/possible shapes, resolving conflicts by backtracking or deduction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a 2D array of integers representing colors or fills (1 likely as background/white, 2+ as colored regions, 8 as unknowns/blanks to be resolved, and other numbers like 3-9 as special markers or obstacles). The goal is to transform the grid by applying rules to fill or adjust 8's and possibly other elements based on patterns like bounded regions or connections, ensuring consistency across rows and potentially columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 8's should be filled only if they form internal sequences bounded by the same non-8 color (e.g., >1) on both sides within a row, treating them as part of an extending colored region; however, boundaries must handle edges carefully to avoid assuming a default color like 0.
 * Index bounds are critical: when scanning for left/right non-8 bounds around 8-sequences, the code must prevent out-of-range access (e.g., l < 0 or r >= n), which caused crashes; use safe checks like if l >= 0 before accessing row[l].
 * The puzzle likely involves row-wise processing first, but may require column-wise or global consistency checks, as the grid shows symmetric or repeating patterns (e.g., 2-regions with embedded numbers like 4,6,9 that might act as "seeds" or fixed points not to overwrite).
 * Subtle elements: Embedded numbers (3-9) in colored regions (e.g., 2's) should remain unchanged unless rules specify merging; all-1 rows suggest background filling, but over-filling (e.g., turning everything to 1) ignores colored blobs. 8's might only fill if bounds are strictly same and non-background (not 1). Training errors indicate the need for robust edge cases, like 8's at row starts/ends or isolated 8's.
 * Global considerations: The grid has vertical symmetry and repeating 2-blob structures with varying embedded numbers (e.g., row 3 has 4 and 9 in 2's, row 10 has 6,7,4,9); rules might propagate fills vertically or match patterns across the grid. Deepcopy is useful to avoid mutating input, but ensure the function returns a modified copy.
 * Potential misses: Not handling cases where 8's are adjacent to 1's (background) without a matching bound; ignoring vertical influences (e.g., 8 in row 4 might align with patterns above/below); assuming left_c/right_c >1 without verifying they are actual colors (1 might be invalid for filling).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def fill_eights_between_same_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Fills sequences of 8's in each row if they are bounded by the same non-8 color on both sides.
    This handles internal 8's in colored regions, as observed in test inputs.
    """
    g = deepcopy(g)
    for r in range(len(g)):
        row = g[r]
        i = 0
        n = len(row)
        while i < n:
            if row[i] != 8:
                i += 1
                continue
            start = i
            while i < n and row[i] == 8:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            # Find left bounding non-8 (safer version needed)
            l = start - 1
            while l >= 0 and row[l] == 8:
                l -= 1
            left_c = row[l] if l >= 0 else 0  # 0 as edge sentinel
            # Find right bounding non-8 (safer version needed)
            r = end + 1
            while r < n and row[r] == 8:
                r += 1
            right_c = row[r] if r < n else 0  # 0 as edge sentinel
            if left_c == right_c and left_c > 1:  # >1 to exclude background 1
                for k in range(start, end + 1):
                    row[k] = left_c
        g[r] = row
    return g
```
(Note: This function is conceptually helpful for row-wise 8-filling but is currently broken due to potential index errors in bound finding; it could be fixed with better sentinels or conditional access. No other types/tools from attempts, as this is the primary one.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on filling internal 8-sequences in rows bounded by matching colors >1, which aligns with a core rule for resolving blanks in colored regions.
 * What worked: Successfully deepcopy'd the grid to avoid mutation; generated a partial output for the test input without crashing it (unlike training); correctly skipped non-8 cells and identified sequences.
 * What didn't work: Caused "list assignment index out of range" errors in all three training examples, likely due to unsafe access when l < 0 or r >= n during bound finding (e.g., row[l] or row[r] without checks); in test, it failed to fill the 8 in row 4 (position 3: [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]) because left bound (1) != right bound (1? but interrupted by 9), leaving 8 unchanged and not propagating any fills; over-filled some rows to all 1's? Wait, no—the output shows mostly unchanged rows with 8 intact, suggesting the filling condition never triggered properly.
 * The program function simply wraps the fill_eights, which is minimal but doesn't address vertical or multi-pass rules, missing broader puzzle elements like connecting 2-blobs vertically.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., blobs or regions) was attempted, which might be essential for identifying bounded areas globally; this attempt assumes purely row-local rules, ignoring potential column interactions.
 * Training mismatches: All errored out, so no validation; unknown why index errors occurred (possibly training grids have 8's at edges without sentinels), but it demonstrates lack of robustness.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It largely mirrors the input grid (assuming standard input has similar structure), with the 8 in row 4 (0-indexed) remaining unfilled (output shows [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]), and embedded numbers like 9,4,7 unchanged, but no evident filling of 8's despite the rule intent—suggesting the bounding condition failed (left of 8 is 1, right is 1 but with 9 nearby, possibly not matching strictly).
 * Many rows are output as repeating 1's or partial 2-blobs (e.g., row 1: [1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,...] unchanged), which might be correct if no 8's to fill, but the all-1 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,7) look like background preservation; however, later rows like 15-19 show 2-blobs with embedded 9,4,5,3 which remain, indicating no overwriting happened.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should resolve the 8 to match surrounding pattern (e.g., fill to 1 or extend a color, but based on rules, possibly to 4 if bounded by 4's—though here bounds are 1's); instead, 8 persists, and no vertical consistency (e.g., row 27 mirrors row 4 with 8 and 9's unfilled). This doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as 8's are unresolved blanks; it seems like the code ran but skipped filling due to mismatched bounds or bugs.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 15:48:54] Response:
**High level:** This is a Fillomino-style logic puzzle where a grid (with 8s representing empty/unfilled cells, 1s likely acting as boundaries, dividers, or pre-filled non-polyomino cells, and scattered numbers 2-9 as given clues in the bottom row) must be filled such that groups of identical numbers form orthogonally connected polyominoes exactly matching the number's value (e.g., three 3's connected together). The program attempts to automate filling by propagating numbers horizontally into sequences of 8s based on nearby clues or bounds, but it ignores vertical connections, full polyomino validation, and multi-step deduction.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Polyominoes must be exactly the size of the number (e.g., a 5 requires exactly five connected 5's; no more, no less), and same-number polyominoes cannot touch orthogonally even if separate groups.
 * 8s are empty cells to be filled; 1s appear to serve as fixed boundaries or walls that cannot be part of polyominoes (they block horizontal/vertical propagation and remain 1s in outputs).
 * Clues (2-9) are given primarily in the bottom row, separated by 8s, but fillings can extend vertically into upper rows; horizontal-only filling misses cases where polyominoes span rows (e.g., vertical stacks like three 2's in rows 5-7 of train1 expected output).
 * Deduction often requires looking beyond immediate bounds: if a sequence of 8s is bounded by 1s, the fill number comes from the nearest clue (left or right), but only if the sequence length matches or can connect to form the exact polyomino size; over-filling (e.g., assigning a number to a sequence longer/shorter than needed) breaks the rule.
 * Subtle: Some regions remain 8s if they are not part of any clue-based polyomino (e.g., isolated 8s between groups in train1 row2 positions 5-6 stay 8, not filled with 5). Propagation must consider both directions and avoid assuming all 8-sequences are fillable—some are "gaps" between polyominoes.
 * The bottom row (clues) is untouchable (skipped in processing), and the puzzle assumes orthogonal (up/down/left/right) connectivity only—no diagonals.
 * Edge cases: Single-cell clues (rare, but if length=1 bounded by 1s, it may copy the nearest clue directly); long 1-sequences may indicate separate regions; vertical priority over horizontal in conflicts (e.g., train1 rows 5-7 fill vertically with 2's and 6's despite horizontal 8s).
 * All attempts fail to validate polyomino sizes post-filling (e.g., no check if a filled group actually connects to exactly N cells), leading to overfills or wrong numbers.
 * Grids vary in size (20x20 for train1/2, 27x27 for train3), so dimension handling is key, but processing only upper rows (skipping bottom) is correct but insufficient without vertical logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
```
(This is a simple, correct utility for getting grid height/width; useful for iteration bounds.)

The main `program` function is an attempt at filling logic but is broken overall (see below); it correctly identifies horizontal 8-sequences but fails on number selection and vertical integration. No other helper functions are provided, but a potential useful addition could be a function to find nearest clue horizontally/vertically:
```python
def find_nearest_clue(g: List[List[int]], row: int, col: int, direction: str) -> int:
    # Example stub: search left/right/up/down from (row, col) for first 2-9, skipping 1s and 8s
    # Return 0 if none found
    pass
```
(This is conceptual; not in the attempt but would help for better propagation than the attempt's buggy left/right search.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and skips the bottom clue row, uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, and properly detects horizontal sequences of 8s bounded by non-8s (e.g., correctly fills the two 2's in train1 row2/3 bounded by 1s, matching expected).
 * It works for simple cases where a horizontal 8-sequence is directly bounded by matching clues >1 (e.g., partial matches in train1 for 7's in row2/3), and sometimes picks the right number from left/right when bounded by 1s (e.g., 3's in train9/10).
 * However, it fails to handle vertical propagation entirely—no code for checking/connecting across rows, leading to misses like the vertical 2's and 6's in train1 rows5-7 (generated keeps 8s, expected fills them) and vertical 6's in train3 rows13-17 (generated all 8s, expected 6's in col11).
 * Bug in bound detection: The left/right bound finding loops incorrectly extend bounds if adjacent 8s (e.g., in train1 row2, it over-extends left/right for the 5-clue area, filling positions 5-6 with 5's where expected 8,8 as a gap).
 * Flawed 1-bounded logic: When bounded by 1s, it prefers left clue but only if left 1-sequence length==1, else right— this is arbitrary and wrong (e.g., in train1 row9, it picks 9 for a sequence that should be 3 from left, and fills 6's correctly but in wrong spot; in train2 row2, it leaves 3's as 1's instead of filling adjacent 8? Wait, input unclear but generated has 1,2,1,2 instead of expected 1,2,1,2 but misses later 3/8).
 * In train3, it fills upper horizontal groups (e.g., 3's and 2's in row3) but completely ignores lower vertical stacks (e.g., expected 6's in rows13-17 col11 stay 8s; expected 4's in row9 col14-16 become wrong 6,1,1 or similar—mismatch in positioning).
 * Over-filling issue: Fills sequences longer than the clue (e.g., train1 row9 fills four 9's? but clue is 9, yet expected uses 3's instead, suggesting vertical or size mismatch not checked).
 * The while-loop for sequence detection skips non-8 cells correctly but doesn't revisit after filling (no iterative propagation), so partial fills don't trigger further changes (e.g., train2 misses filling after initial 8's to 3/4).
 * Function `program` is partially helpful for horizontal detection but broken for full solving (don't reuse without vertical logic and validation); the inner left/right clue search is unhelpful/buggy as it skips 1s but doesn't search vertically or validate size.
 * All training examples incorrect: Train1 mismatches in filled gaps (e.g., extra 5's/9's where 8's/3's expected) and misses verticals; Train2 mismatches in partial horizontals (e.g., generated 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,3 but expected 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,8 and vertical 3/4/6/7/9 in row4/6); Train3 mismatches in verticals (e.g., no 6's or 4's in lower rows) and some horizontals (e.g., row9 has 6,1,1,6,6,6 but expected 6,1,1,4,4,4).
 * Unknown reasons for some mismatches (e.g., why train1 row10 fills 8,8,8 with 6's correctly but row9 overfills 9's—possibly bound detection error in while l >=0 and g[i][l]==8).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-fills nearly the entire grid with groups of five 2's (e.g., rows2-6 have long horizontal 2,2,2,2,2 sequences bounded by 1s), but this ignores clue sizes in the bottom row (e.g., clues like 4,9,4,7,6,9 require exact polyominoes of those sizes, not all 2's; a group of five 2's would need to be part of ten 2's total for validity, but no such connection exists).
 * It treats borders as all 1s (e.g., row0 all 1s, many rows starting/ending with 1s), suggesting the input had 8s replaced indiscriminately, but expected should leave gaps as 1s or 8s and form vertical/horizontal polyominoes matching bottom clues (e.g., a 9-clue should have nine connected 9's spanning rows, not scattered 2's or 9's in single positions like row3 col22).
 * Wrong numbers in key spots: e.g., row17 has 2,2,9,2,2 but a 9 should connect to eight more 9's (not isolated); row18 has scattered higher numbers (9,4,2,2,5,2,2,3,2,2) that don't form valid polyominoes (e.g., single 9 can't be valid). This indicates the horizontal-only logic failed on a larger/wider grid (29 cols?), creating artificial 1-boundaries and ignoring vertical needs.
 * To handle test, must add vertical search/propagation and size validation (e.g., after filling a group, count connected same-number cells == number value).

[2025-10-02 15:48:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style polyomino puzzle on a grid, where 1s represent walls or barriers, 8s are background/empty space, and scattered numbers (2-9) in the grid and possibly a clue row at the bottom indicate the required size of connected polyomino regions (orthogonally adjacent cells of the same number must form exactly N cells for a clue N). The task is to resolve and fill ambiguous or partial regions by expanding/connecting same-number cells into complete polyominoes of the exact size, without overlapping walls or background, while leaving walls, background, and the clue row unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are bounded by 1s (walls) and 8s (background); fillings must stay within these enclosures and cannot cross them—treat 1s and 8s as impassable.
 * Each number N must form exactly one or more polyominoes of size exactly N; cells with the same N must connect orthogonally (up/down/left/right, no diagonals) to form these shapes, and no polyomino can be larger or smaller than N.
 * Partial clues (single N cells) need to be expanded by claiming adjacent empty cells (non-1, non-8) to reach size N; if multiple possible expansions, resolve based on fitting all clues without conflict (e.g., don't overclaim space needed for another number).
 * The bottom row (e.g., [8, 2, 8, 3, ...]) acts as a fixed clue legend or seed row—do not modify it; it provides initial N placements that must be expanded upward into the grid.
 * Subtle: Some regions may have multiple clues of the same N, requiring multiple separate polyominoes of size N; avoid merging different Ns or same N across walls. Empty regions without clues might remain 8s or need inference from fitting.
 * Overlapping possibilities: If a region has space for multiple polyominoes, prioritize exact fits; e.g., a clue 7 in a larger space might need to snake or L-shape to fill exactly 7 cells without leaving orphans.
 * Edge cases: Thin corridors (e.g., 1-cell wide) limit shapes; vertical/horizontal stretches must match sizes (e.g., a 2x2 block for 4, not a 1x4 line if it doesn't fit clues). Background 8s in regions might be "empty" but can be filled if needed for polyominoes.
 * All training examples show the bottom clue row unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming it's fixed. Grids vary in width (20, 20, 27 cols across examples), so handle variable dimensions.
 * No diagonals for connectivity; only 4-directional adjacency.
 * If a region has no clues, leave as 8s; if overconstrained (impossible fit), but assuming inputs are solvable.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single prior program used flood-fill on non-background/non-wall cells to identify components, then applied rules like filling with "minority color" if no 1s or filling non-1 cells with the other color if 1s present—but this misinterprets the puzzle as color-based merging rather than size-constrained polyomino expansion.
 * Worked: Correctly detected some connected components (e.g., in Train 1, it kept existing 2s,5s,7s in place without overwriting clues); identified walls (1s) and background (8s) accurately; preserved the bottom clue row unchanged.
 * Didn't work: Ignored polyomino size rules entirely—e.g., filled entire components with one number regardless of size (overfilling 7s as just two cells instead of expanding to seven); treated 1s as "walls to fill around" but didn't use them as boundaries for exact N-shapes; minority/majority logic led to arbitrary fills (e.g., Train 1 row 2 kept 7s as two cells, missing extension to [7,7,7,7,7,7? wait no, expected has three 7s in middle and three on right, but generated only two each).
 * Train 1 differences: Generated missed vertical extensions (e.g., rows 6-8 should have 2s in cols 2-3 and 6s in cols 16-17, but output has all 8s there); row 10 has 3s only in two cells but expected extends to six 3s (cols 1-6); row 14 all 8s/1s but expected has 9s in cols 8-9 and 2s in 16-17; unknown why it didn't expand from bottom clues upward.
 * Train 2 differences: Generated left many areas as 1s or unchanged, e.g., row 2 has 2 and 3 isolated but expected connects 2s across (cols 2 and 4); row 4 all 8s but expected has 3 in col 6; row 6 has 7 and 4 isolated but expected connects 4s (cols 6-8? wait, cols 6 and 8 for 4); row 5 has 3 in col 6 but generated empty; failed to expand bottom clues (e.g., 3,4,6 into vertical polyominoes).
 * Train 3 differences: Similar isolation issues—e.g., row 3 has 3,2,9 as singles but expected expands 3 to cols 3-6 (four 3s?), 2 to cols 11-15 (five 2s?), 9 unchanged? Wait, expected has 3s in 3-6 and 3s in 7-9? No, row 3 expected: 3 at col3, then 1s, but actually expands horizontally/vertically; generated missed most expansions (e.g., row 9 has 6 and 4 isolated, expected connects 6s? and 4s in cols 14-18); rows 13-17 all 8s/6? but generated empty, expected has vertical 6s in col11; bottom expansions ignored entirely.
 * extract_regions (from the program) is helpful for finding bounded areas but broken for polyomino logic—needs integration with clue sizes (don't use raw minority fill). No other functions in the attempt; color_count logic is unhelpful/irrelevant (puzzle isn't about colors, but numbers as sizes—discard it).
 * Overall: Attempt shows basic component detection but zero grasp of Fillomino rules (no size enforcement, no expansion from clues), leading to underfilled grids; bottom clues not propagated upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills large rectangular blocks without respecting polyomino sizes (e.g., rows 1-6 have a 5x6 block of 4s, which is 30 cells, but if seeded from a single 4 clue, it should be exactly 4 cells, not 30; similarly, 5-row 9s block is 25 cells, way over size 9). 
 * It treats entire row-spanning areas as single fills (e.g., cols 8-12 as 8s across multiple rows, but 8 is background—should not fill with 8 if claiming for polyominoes; expected likely has smaller, connected shapes like 4-cell 4s snaking around 1s). 
 * Bottom row clues (e.g., 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) are unchanged (good), but no upward expansion visible (e.g., col1 has 4 in bottom, but above it rows 15-20 have 9s/4s/5s/3s, not connected to bottom 4). 
 * Borders of 1s are preserved, but inner empties (implied 8s?) are wrongly uniform-filled, ignoring exact N sizes—e.g., a 5x5 block of 5s would be 25 cells, not size 5; this mismatches Fillomino, where shapes must be exactly N connected cells per clue. 
 * Unknown why it filled with 8s in some blocks (e.g., cols 8-12), as 8 is background—perhaps mistaking empty regions, but expected should fill with numbers from nearby clues or leave empty only if no fit. Overall, it looks like crude region painting, not size-aware polyominoes; to fix, start from each clue position and grow exactly N cells using BFS/possible shapes, resolving conflicts by backtracking or deduction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a 2D array of integers representing colors or fills (1 likely as background/white, 2+ as colored regions, 8 as unknowns/blanks to be resolved, and other numbers like 3-9 as special markers or obstacles). The goal is to transform the grid by applying rules to fill or adjust 8's and possibly other elements based on patterns like bounded regions or connections, ensuring consistency across rows and potentially columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 8's should be filled only if they form internal sequences bounded by the same non-8 color (e.g., >1) on both sides within a row, treating them as part of an extending colored region; however, boundaries must handle edges carefully to avoid assuming a default color like 0.
 * Index bounds are critical: when scanning for left/right non-8 bounds around 8-sequences, the code must prevent out-of-range access (e.g., l < 0 or r >= n), which caused crashes; use safe checks like if l >= 0 before accessing row[l].
 * The puzzle likely involves row-wise processing first, but may require column-wise or global consistency checks, as the grid shows symmetric or repeating patterns (e.g., 2-regions with embedded numbers like 4,6,9 that might act as "seeds" or fixed points not to overwrite).
 * Subtle elements: Embedded numbers (3-9) in colored regions (e.g., 2's) should remain unchanged unless rules specify merging; all-1 rows suggest background filling, but over-filling (e.g., turning everything to 1) ignores colored blobs. 8's might only fill if bounds are strictly same and non-background (not 1). Training errors indicate the need for robust edge cases, like 8's at row starts/ends or isolated 8's.
 * Global considerations: The grid has vertical symmetry and repeating 2-blob structures with varying embedded numbers (e.g., row 3 has 4 and 9 in 2's, row 10 has 6,7,4,9); rules might propagate fills vertically or match patterns across the grid. Deepcopy is useful to avoid mutating input, but ensure the function returns a modified copy.
 * Potential misses: Not handling cases where 8's are adjacent to 1's (background) without a matching bound; ignoring vertical influences (e.g., 8 in row 4 might align with patterns above/below); assuming left_c/right_c >1 without verifying they are actual colors (1 might be invalid for filling).

```
(Note: This function is conceptually helpful for row-wise 8-filling but is currently broken due to potential index errors in bound finding; it could be fixed with better sentinels or conditional access. No other types/tools from attempts, as this is the primary one.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on filling internal 8-sequences in rows bounded by matching colors >1, which aligns with a core rule for resolving blanks in colored regions.
 * What worked: Successfully deepcopy'd the grid to avoid mutation; generated a partial output for the test input without crashing it (unlike training); correctly skipped non-8 cells and identified sequences.
 * What didn't work: Caused "list assignment index out of range" errors in all three training examples, likely due to unsafe access when l < 0 or r >= n during bound finding (e.g., row[l] or row[r] without checks); in test, it failed to fill the 8 in row 4 (position 3: [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]) because left bound (1) != right bound (1? but interrupted by 9), leaving 8 unchanged and not propagating any fills; over-filled some rows to all 1's? Wait, no—the output shows mostly unchanged rows with 8 intact, suggesting the filling condition never triggered properly.
 * The program function simply wraps the fill_eights, which is minimal but doesn't address vertical or multi-pass rules, missing broader puzzle elements like connecting 2-blobs vertically.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., blobs or regions) was attempted, which might be essential for identifying bounded areas globally; this attempt assumes purely row-local rules, ignoring potential column interactions.
 * Training mismatches: All errored out, so no validation; unknown why index errors occurred (possibly training grids have 8's at edges without sentinels), but it demonstrates lack of robustness.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It largely mirrors the input grid (assuming standard input has similar structure), with the 8 in row 4 (0-indexed) remaining unfilled (output shows [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]), and embedded numbers like 9,4,7 unchanged, but no evident filling of 8's despite the rule intent—suggesting the bounding condition failed (left of 8 is 1, right is 1 but with 9 nearby, possibly not matching strictly).
 * Many rows are output as repeating 1's or partial 2-blobs (e.g., row 1: [1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,...] unchanged), which might be correct if no 8's to fill, but the all-1 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,7) look like background preservation; however, later rows like 15-19 show 2-blobs with embedded 9,4,5,3 which remain, indicating no overwriting happened.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should resolve the 8 to match surrounding pattern (e.g., fill to 1 or extend a color, but based on rules, possibly to 4 if bounded by 4's—though here bounds are 1's); instead, 8 persists, and no vertical consistency (e.g., row 27 mirrors row 4 with 8 and 9's unfilled). This doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as 8's are unresolved blanks; it seems like the code ran but skipped filling due to mismatched bounds or bugs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a Fillomino-style logic puzzle where a grid (with 8s representing empty/unfilled cells, 1s likely acting as boundaries, dividers, or pre-filled non-polyomino cells, and scattered numbers 2-9 as given clues in the bottom row) must be filled such that groups of identical numbers form orthogonally connected polyominoes exactly matching the number's value (e.g., three 3's connected together). The program attempts to automate filling by propagating numbers horizontally into sequences of 8s based on nearby clues or bounds, but it ignores vertical connections, full polyomino validation, and multi-step deduction.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Polyominoes must be exactly the size of the number (e.g., a 5 requires exactly five connected 5's; no more, no less), and same-number polyominoes cannot touch orthogonally even if separate groups.
 * 8s are empty cells to be filled; 1s appear to serve as fixed boundaries or walls that cannot be part of polyominoes (they block horizontal/vertical propagation and remain 1s in outputs).
 * Clues (2-9) are given primarily in the bottom row, separated by 8s, but fillings can extend vertically into upper rows; horizontal-only filling misses cases where polyominoes span rows (e.g., vertical stacks like three 2's in rows 5-7 of train1 expected output).
 * Deduction often requires looking beyond immediate bounds: if a sequence of 8s is bounded by 1s, the fill number comes from the nearest clue (left or right), but only if the sequence length matches or can connect to form the exact polyomino size; over-filling (e.g., assigning a number to a sequence longer/shorter than needed) breaks the rule.
 * Subtle: Some regions remain 8s if they are not part of any clue-based polyomino (e.g., isolated 8s between groups in train1 row2 positions 5-6 stay 8, not filled with 5). Propagation must consider both directions and avoid assuming all 8-sequences are fillable—some are "gaps" between polyominoes.
 * The bottom row (clues) is untouchable (skipped in processing), and the puzzle assumes orthogonal (up/down/left/right) connectivity only—no diagonals.
 * Edge cases: Single-cell clues (rare, but if length=1 bounded by 1s, it may copy the nearest clue directly); long 1-sequences may indicate separate regions; vertical priority over horizontal in conflicts (e.g., train1 rows 5-7 fill vertically with 2's and 6's despite horizontal 8s).
 * All attempts fail to validate polyomino sizes post-filling (e.g., no check if a filled group actually connects to exactly N cells), leading to overfills or wrong numbers.
 * Grids vary in size (20x20 for train1/2, 27x27 for train3), so dimension handling is key, but processing only upper rows (skipping bottom) is correct but insufficient without vertical logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
```
(This is a simple, correct utility for getting grid height/width; useful for iteration bounds.)

The main `program` function is an attempt at filling logic but is broken overall (see below); it correctly identifies horizontal 8-sequences but fails on number selection and vertical integration. No other helper functions are provided, but a potential useful addition could be a function to find nearest clue horizontally/vertically:
```python
def find_nearest_clue(g: List[List[int]], row: int, col: int, direction: str) -> int:
    # Example stub: search left/right/up/down from (row, col) for first 2-9, skipping 1s and 8s
    # Return 0 if none found
    pass
```
(This is conceptual; not in the attempt but would help for better propagation than the attempt's buggy left/right search.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and skips the bottom clue row, uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, and properly detects horizontal sequences of 8s bounded by non-8s (e.g., correctly fills the two 2's in train1 row2/3 bounded by 1s, matching expected).
 * It works for simple cases where a horizontal 8-sequence is directly bounded by matching clues >1 (e.g., partial matches in train1 for 7's in row2/3), and sometimes picks the right number from left/right when bounded by 1s (e.g., 3's in train9/10).
 * However, it fails to handle vertical propagation entirely—no code for checking/connecting across rows, leading to misses like the vertical 2's and 6's in train1 rows5-7 (generated keeps 8s, expected fills them) and vertical 6's in train3 rows13-17 (generated all 8s, expected 6's in col11).
 * Bug in bound detection: The left/right bound finding loops incorrectly extend bounds if adjacent 8s (e.g., in train1 row2, it over-extends left/right for the 5-clue area, filling positions 5-6 with 5's where expected 8,8 as a gap).
 * Flawed 1-bounded logic: When bounded by 1s, it prefers left clue but only if left 1-sequence length==1, else right— this is arbitrary and wrong (e.g., in train1 row9, it picks 9 for a sequence that should be 3 from left, and fills 6's correctly but in wrong spot; in train2 row2, it leaves 3's as 1's instead of filling adjacent 8? Wait, input unclear but generated has 1,2,1,2 instead of expected 1,2,1,2 but misses later 3/8).
 * In train3, it fills upper horizontal groups (e.g., 3's and 2's in row3) but completely ignores lower vertical stacks (e.g., expected 6's in rows13-17 col11 stay 8s; expected 4's in row9 col14-16 become wrong 6,1,1 or similar—mismatch in positioning).
 * Over-filling issue: Fills sequences longer than the clue (e.g., train1 row9 fills four 9's? but clue is 9, yet expected uses 3's instead, suggesting vertical or size mismatch not checked).
 * The while-loop for sequence detection skips non-8 cells correctly but doesn't revisit after filling (no iterative propagation), so partial fills don't trigger further changes (e.g., train2 misses filling after initial 8's to 3/4).
 * Function `program` is partially helpful for horizontal detection but broken for full solving (don't reuse without vertical logic and validation); the inner left/right clue search is unhelpful/buggy as it skips 1s but doesn't search vertically or validate size.
 * All training examples incorrect: Train1 mismatches in filled gaps (e.g., extra 5's/9's where 8's/3's expected) and misses verticals; Train2 mismatches in partial horizontals (e.g., generated 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,3 but expected 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,8 and vertical 3/4/6/7/9 in row4/6); Train3 mismatches in verticals (e.g., no 6's or 4's in lower rows) and some horizontals (e.g., row9 has 6,1,1,6,6,6 but expected 6,1,1,4,4,4).
 * Unknown reasons for some mismatches (e.g., why train1 row10 fills 8,8,8 with 6's correctly but row9 overfills 9's—possibly bound detection error in while l >=0 and g[i][l]==8).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-fills nearly the entire grid with groups of five 2's (e.g., rows2-6 have long horizontal 2,2,2,2,2 sequences bounded by 1s), but this ignores clue sizes in the bottom row (e.g., clues like 4,9,4,7,6,9 require exact polyominoes of those sizes, not all 2's; a group of five 2's would need to be part of ten 2's total for validity, but no such connection exists).
 * It treats borders as all 1s (e.g., row0 all 1s, many rows starting/ending with 1s), suggesting the input had 8s replaced indiscriminately, but expected should leave gaps as 1s or 8s and form vertical/horizontal polyominoes matching bottom clues (e.g., a 9-clue should have nine connected 9's spanning rows, not scattered 2's or 9's in single positions like row3 col22).
 * Wrong numbers in key spots: e.g., row17 has 2,2,9,2,2 but a 9 should connect to eight more 9's (not isolated); row18 has scattered higher numbers (9,4,2,2,5,2,2,3,2,2) that don't form valid polyominoes (e.g., single 9 can't be valid). This indicates the horizontal-only logic failed on a larger/wider grid (29 cols?), creating artificial 1-boundaries and ignoring vertical needs.
 * To handle test, must add vertical search/propagation and size validation (e.g., after filling a group, count connected same-number cells == number value).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style logic puzzle on a grid with walls (cells marked 1, which block regions), clue cells (numbers 2-9 indicating the exact size of the connected region that cell belongs to), and empty cells (marked 8, to be filled with numbers 2-9 such that all connected cells sharing the same number form a polyomino of exactly that size, without crossing walls or clues mismatched to their regions). The goal is to deduce and fill all 8s logically based on clues and constraints, ensuring no region violates size rules, clues are satisfied, and the grid is fully resolved without isolated cells or overflows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (1s) act as barriers; regions cannot connect across or include 1s, and 1s themselves are not part of any numbered region.
 * Clues (2-9) must be the starting point for a region of exactly that many connected cells ( orthogonally adjacent, no diagonals), all filled with the same number as the clue; no two different clues can be in the same region unless they match in value and size constraints.
 * Empty cells (8s) must be filled to extend regions logically; single-cell regions are impossible since clues start at 2, so all 8s must connect to existing clues or form new regions only if deducible (but typically all connect back to clues).
 * Horizontal and vertical fillings must consider adjacent clues and skipped walls (1s between sequences of 8s), but cannot assume fills without verifying total region size; over-filling (e.g., long chains of the same number exceeding the clue value) violates rules.
 * Special cases for all-8 rows: These may need targeted filling based on bottom clues (e.g., if a specific clue like bottom[13]==9 triggers patterns), but must avoid assuming offsets without bounds checking; even/odd indexing for offsets risks skipping or duplicating fills.
 * Subtle deduction rules: When 8s are bounded by clues on left/right (or up/down), fill with the matching clue if sizes align (e.g., equal clues with no/minimal skipped 1s); if unequal, prefer the closer/bounding clue or use length of 8s sequence to decide (e.g., short sequences like length=1 or 2 favor smaller/nearer clues, but only if total region won't exceed); symmetric cases (equal skipped 1s) require checking sequence length against clue (e.g., length=3 with 1 skipped might take max/min based on puzzle norms).
 * Avoid naive fills: Do not fill entire sequences of 8s with a single number without counting total connected cells (including vertical/horizontal extensions); this can create oversized regions (e.g., five 2s in a row is invalid for size 2).
 * Grid structure: Clues often in bottom/top rows separated by 1s; upper grid has blocks of 1s (solid walls) and open areas with 8s; fills must propagate across rows/columns without leaving isolated 8s.
 * Edge cases: Zero skipped 1s allows direct propagation from one side; multiple skipped 1s (e.g., 1 or 2) may block or weight toward one clue; clues like 9 may indicate large regions spanning multiple rows.
 * Full resolution: Program must iterate fills (horizontal then vertical, possibly multiple passes) until no 8s remain; partial fills (leftover 8s) indicate incomplete logic.
 * No diagonals or wrapping; regions are strictly orthogonal polyominoes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    """Fills horizontal sequences of 8s based on left/right bounding clues and skipped walls.
    Considers sequence length, skipped 1s count, and clue equality to decide fill number.

    # (Implementation as in attempt, but note: logic is partial; needs size validation post-fill)
    # ...

```

```python
def fill_vertical(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Similar to fill_horizontal but for columns; extracts column as list, fills 8 sequences,
    then updates grid. Handles upper/lower bounds and skipped 1s analogously."""
    # (Implementation as in attempt, but note: similar partial logic issues)
    # ...
    return g
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `fill_all8_rows`: Broken due to index out of range errors (e.g., accessing offset_cols[ii-1] when ii exceeds len(offset_cols), or assuming fixed indices like g[h-2][13]==9 without grid validation); overly specific to unconfirmed patterns (e.g., even/odd ii for offsets +3 from clues); does not generally help deduce regions and causes crashes—remove or heavily refactor.
 * No region size validation function: All attempts lack a post-fill check to ensure no region exceeds its number (critical flaw); without this, fills are speculative and invalid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (no prior ones detailed) focused on horizontal/vertical filling of 8 sequences bounded by clues, with heuristics for unequal clues (prefer nearer/bounding, adjust by skipped 1s and sequence length) and special all-8 row handling, but failed entirely on training examples due to index errors in `fill_all8_rows` (out of range on offset_cols and fixed [13] access, likely from assuming clue positions without bounds checks).
 * What worked: For the test input, it successfully ran without error and filled many 8s into 2s (e.g., horizontal stretches of five 2s in multiple rows, like rows 1-5 and 8-11), and placed some higher numbers (e.g., 4 at [3][3], 9 at [3][22], 6 at [10][3], 7 at [10][10], 4 at [10][22], 9 at [11][22], 2s extended in lower sections like rows 15-20 with added 9/4/5/3 placements); this shows basic detection of 8 sequences and clue propagation for small/default fills (2s as fallback?).
 * What didn't work: Training examples 1-3 all crashed with "list assignment index out of range" (likely in `fill_all8_rows` when computing/iterating offset_cols or accessing g[h-2][13] on smaller/variable grids); no training passes, indicating non-robust code. For test, filling is incomplete (e.g., row 27 still has an 8 at position 3), and logic is flawed—long horizontal 2-runs (e.g., five connected 2s in row 1 cols 1-5) create invalid regions (size 5 > 2, violating Fillomino rules); vertical connections (e.g., stacked 2s across rows 1-5 in col 1) would compound to even larger invalid regions. Heuristics for fill_n (e.g., taking max/min for length=3 with skipped=1, or preferring left if skipped_left < skipped_right) are ad-hoc and over-aggressive, ignoring total region size; symmetric cases (equal clues/skipped) have inconsistent rules (e.g., min vs max in vertical vs horizontal). No iteration for propagating fills across directions, leaving deductions partial. `fill_all8_rows` contributed nothing useful here (no all-8 rows filled specially, and it may have skipped due to conditions like g[h-2][13]==9 not met).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates partial grasp of bounding clues and sequence filling but misses core region validation, leading to invalid outputs; errors prevent any training success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially filled the grid (e.g., upper blocks like rows 1-6 and 8-13 have patterns of 1s separating stretches of five 2s, with isolated higher numbers like 4/9/6/7 inserted; lower sections rows 15-20 mirror this with 2s and 5/3/9/4; solid 1-rows at 0,6-7,13-14,20-21,25-26,28 act as barriers) but does not look correct overall.
 * Issues: Many 2-fills create oversized regions (e.g., row 1: 2s at cols 1-5 connect horizontally to size 5 >2; vertically, col 1 has 2s in rows 1-5,8-11,15-20 stacking to size 15+ >2, invalid); this suggests the program defaulted to 2s for unknown/bounded 8s without size checks. Higher placements (e.g., 9 at row 3 col 22, 5 at row 17 col 16) might align with nearby clues (bottom row has 9s/5s), but without full connectivity check, they could be wrong (e.g., if the 9-region doesn't reach size 9). Incomplete: Row 27 retains an 8 (at col 3, between 4 and 1,9 clues), meaning deduction failed there—likely needs vertical propagation from above or better bounding logic. Expected output should have no 8s left, all regions exactly matching their number (e.g., 2s only in isolated domino pairs, 9s in nonominoes connecting to clue positions), and no overflows; this output violates that by over-filling 2s and leaving gaps, so it mismatches a correct resolution (difference likely due to lack of region counting and multi-pass deduction).

[2025-10-02 16:15:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style polyomino puzzle on a grid, where 1s represent walls or barriers, 8s are background/empty space, and scattered numbers (2-9) in the grid and possibly a clue row at the bottom indicate the required size of connected polyomino regions (orthogonally adjacent cells of the same number must form exactly N cells for a clue N). The task is to resolve and fill ambiguous or partial regions by expanding/connecting same-number cells into complete polyominoes of the exact size, without overlapping walls or background, while leaving walls, background, and the clue row unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are bounded by 1s (walls) and 8s (background); fillings must stay within these enclosures and cannot cross them—treat 1s and 8s as impassable.
 * Each number N must form exactly one or more polyominoes of size exactly N; cells with the same N must connect orthogonally (up/down/left/right, no diagonals) to form these shapes, and no polyomino can be larger or smaller than N.
 * Partial clues (single N cells) need to be expanded by claiming adjacent empty cells (non-1, non-8) to reach size N; if multiple possible expansions, resolve based on fitting all clues without conflict (e.g., don't overclaim space needed for another number).
 * The bottom row (e.g., [8, 2, 8, 3, ...]) acts as a fixed clue legend or seed row—do not modify it; it provides initial N placements that must be expanded upward into the grid.
 * Subtle: Some regions may have multiple clues of the same N, requiring multiple separate polyominoes of size N; avoid merging different Ns or same N across walls. Empty regions without clues might remain 8s or need inference from fitting.
 * Overlapping possibilities: If a region has space for multiple polyominoes, prioritize exact fits; e.g., a clue 7 in a larger space might need to snake or L-shape to fill exactly 7 cells without leaving orphans.
 * Edge cases: Thin corridors (e.g., 1-cell wide) limit shapes; vertical/horizontal stretches must match sizes (e.g., a 2x2 block for 4, not a 1x4 line if it doesn't fit clues). Background 8s in regions might be "empty" but can be filled if needed for polyominoes.
 * All training examples show the bottom clue row unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming it's fixed. Grids vary in width (20, 20, 27 cols across examples), so handle variable dimensions.
 * No diagonals for connectivity; only 4-directional adjacency.
 * If a region has no clues, leave as 8s; if overconstrained (impossible fit), but assuming inputs are solvable.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single prior program used flood-fill on non-background/non-wall cells to identify components, then applied rules like filling with "minority color" if no 1s or filling non-1 cells with the other color if 1s present—but this misinterprets the puzzle as color-based merging rather than size-constrained polyomino expansion.
 * Worked: Correctly detected some connected components (e.g., in Train 1, it kept existing 2s,5s,7s in place without overwriting clues); identified walls (1s) and background (8s) accurately; preserved the bottom clue row unchanged.
 * Didn't work: Ignored polyomino size rules entirely—e.g., filled entire components with one number regardless of size (overfilling 7s as just two cells instead of expanding to seven); treated 1s as "walls to fill around" but didn't use them as boundaries for exact N-shapes; minority/majority logic led to arbitrary fills (e.g., Train 1 row 2 kept 7s as two cells, missing extension to [7,7,7,7,7,7? wait no, expected has three 7s in middle and three on right, but generated only two each).
 * Train 1 differences: Generated missed vertical extensions (e.g., rows 6-8 should have 2s in cols 2-3 and 6s in cols 16-17, but output has all 8s there); row 10 has 3s only in two cells but expected extends to six 3s (cols 1-6); row 14 all 8s/1s but expected has 9s in cols 8-9 and 2s in 16-17; unknown why it didn't expand from bottom clues upward.
 * Train 2 differences: Generated left many areas as 1s or unchanged, e.g., row 2 has 2 and 3 isolated but expected connects 2s across (cols 2 and 4); row 4 all 8s but expected has 3 in col 6; row 6 has 7 and 4 isolated but expected connects 4s (cols 6-8? wait, cols 6 and 8 for 4); row 5 has 3 in col 6 but generated empty; failed to expand bottom clues (e.g., 3,4,6 into vertical polyominoes).
 * Train 3 differences: Similar isolation issues—e.g., row 3 has 3,2,9 as singles but expected expands 3 to cols 3-6 (four 3s?), 2 to cols 11-15 (five 2s?), 9 unchanged? Wait, expected has 3s in 3-6 and 3s in 7-9? No, row 3 expected: 3 at col3, then 1s, but actually expands horizontally/vertically; generated missed most expansions (e.g., row 9 has 6 and 4 isolated, expected connects 6s? and 4s in cols 14-18); rows 13-17 all 8s/6? but generated empty, expected has vertical 6s in col11; bottom expansions ignored entirely.
 * extract_regions (from the program) is helpful for finding bounded areas but broken for polyomino logic—needs integration with clue sizes (don't use raw minority fill). No other functions in the attempt; color_count logic is unhelpful/irrelevant (puzzle isn't about colors, but numbers as sizes—discard it).
 * Overall: Attempt shows basic component detection but zero grasp of Fillomino rules (no size enforcement, no expansion from clues), leading to underfilled grids; bottom clues not propagated upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills large rectangular blocks without respecting polyomino sizes (e.g., rows 1-6 have a 5x6 block of 4s, which is 30 cells, but if seeded from a single 4 clue, it should be exactly 4 cells, not 30; similarly, 5-row 9s block is 25 cells, way over size 9). 
 * It treats entire row-spanning areas as single fills (e.g., cols 8-12 as 8s across multiple rows, but 8 is background—should not fill with 8 if claiming for polyominoes; expected likely has smaller, connected shapes like 4-cell 4s snaking around 1s). 
 * Bottom row clues (e.g., 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) are unchanged (good), but no upward expansion visible (e.g., col1 has 4 in bottom, but above it rows 15-20 have 9s/4s/5s/3s, not connected to bottom 4). 
 * Borders of 1s are preserved, but inner empties (implied 8s?) are wrongly uniform-filled, ignoring exact N sizes—e.g., a 5x5 block of 5s would be 25 cells, not size 5; this mismatches Fillomino, where shapes must be exactly N connected cells per clue. 
 * Unknown why it filled with 8s in some blocks (e.g., cols 8-12), as 8 is background—perhaps mistaking empty regions, but expected should fill with numbers from nearby clues or leave empty only if no fit. Overall, it looks like crude region painting, not size-aware polyominoes; to fix, start from each clue position and grow exactly N cells using BFS/possible shapes, resolving conflicts by backtracking or deduction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a 2D array of integers representing colors or fills (1 likely as background/white, 2+ as colored regions, 8 as unknowns/blanks to be resolved, and other numbers like 3-9 as special markers or obstacles). The goal is to transform the grid by applying rules to fill or adjust 8's and possibly other elements based on patterns like bounded regions or connections, ensuring consistency across rows and potentially columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 8's should be filled only if they form internal sequences bounded by the same non-8 color (e.g., >1) on both sides within a row, treating them as part of an extending colored region; however, boundaries must handle edges carefully to avoid assuming a default color like 0.
 * Index bounds are critical: when scanning for left/right non-8 bounds around 8-sequences, the code must prevent out-of-range access (e.g., l < 0 or r >= n), which caused crashes; use safe checks like if l >= 0 before accessing row[l].
 * The puzzle likely involves row-wise processing first, but may require column-wise or global consistency checks, as the grid shows symmetric or repeating patterns (e.g., 2-regions with embedded numbers like 4,6,9 that might act as "seeds" or fixed points not to overwrite).
 * Subtle elements: Embedded numbers (3-9) in colored regions (e.g., 2's) should remain unchanged unless rules specify merging; all-1 rows suggest background filling, but over-filling (e.g., turning everything to 1) ignores colored blobs. 8's might only fill if bounds are strictly same and non-background (not 1). Training errors indicate the need for robust edge cases, like 8's at row starts/ends or isolated 8's.
 * Global considerations: The grid has vertical symmetry and repeating 2-blob structures with varying embedded numbers (e.g., row 3 has 4 and 9 in 2's, row 10 has 6,7,4,9); rules might propagate fills vertically or match patterns across the grid. Deepcopy is useful to avoid mutating input, but ensure the function returns a modified copy.
 * Potential misses: Not handling cases where 8's are adjacent to 1's (background) without a matching bound; ignoring vertical influences (e.g., 8 in row 4 might align with patterns above/below); assuming left_c/right_c >1 without verifying they are actual colors (1 might be invalid for filling).

```
(Note: This function is conceptually helpful for row-wise 8-filling but is currently broken due to potential index errors in bound finding; it could be fixed with better sentinels or conditional access. No other types/tools from attempts, as this is the primary one.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on filling internal 8-sequences in rows bounded by matching colors >1, which aligns with a core rule for resolving blanks in colored regions.
 * What worked: Successfully deepcopy'd the grid to avoid mutation; generated a partial output for the test input without crashing it (unlike training); correctly skipped non-8 cells and identified sequences.
 * What didn't work: Caused "list assignment index out of range" errors in all three training examples, likely due to unsafe access when l < 0 or r >= n during bound finding (e.g., row[l] or row[r] without checks); in test, it failed to fill the 8 in row 4 (position 3: [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]) because left bound (1) != right bound (1? but interrupted by 9), leaving 8 unchanged and not propagating any fills; over-filled some rows to all 1's? Wait, no—the output shows mostly unchanged rows with 8 intact, suggesting the filling condition never triggered properly.
 * The program function simply wraps the fill_eights, which is minimal but doesn't address vertical or multi-pass rules, missing broader puzzle elements like connecting 2-blobs vertically.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., blobs or regions) was attempted, which might be essential for identifying bounded areas globally; this attempt assumes purely row-local rules, ignoring potential column interactions.
 * Training mismatches: All errored out, so no validation; unknown why index errors occurred (possibly training grids have 8's at edges without sentinels), but it demonstrates lack of robustness.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It largely mirrors the input grid (assuming standard input has similar structure), with the 8 in row 4 (0-indexed) remaining unfilled (output shows [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]), and embedded numbers like 9,4,7 unchanged, but no evident filling of 8's despite the rule intent—suggesting the bounding condition failed (left of 8 is 1, right is 1 but with 9 nearby, possibly not matching strictly).
 * Many rows are output as repeating 1's or partial 2-blobs (e.g., row 1: [1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,...] unchanged), which might be correct if no 8's to fill, but the all-1 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,7) look like background preservation; however, later rows like 15-19 show 2-blobs with embedded 9,4,5,3 which remain, indicating no overwriting happened.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should resolve the 8 to match surrounding pattern (e.g., fill to 1 or extend a color, but based on rules, possibly to 4 if bounded by 4's—though here bounds are 1's); instead, 8 persists, and no vertical consistency (e.g., row 27 mirrors row 4 with 8 and 9's unfilled). This doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as 8's are unresolved blanks; it seems like the code ran but skipped filling due to mismatched bounds or bugs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a Fillomino-style logic puzzle where a grid (with 8s representing empty/unfilled cells, 1s likely acting as boundaries, dividers, or pre-filled non-polyomino cells, and scattered numbers 2-9 as given clues in the bottom row) must be filled such that groups of identical numbers form orthogonally connected polyominoes exactly matching the number's value (e.g., three 3's connected together). The program attempts to automate filling by propagating numbers horizontally into sequences of 8s based on nearby clues or bounds, but it ignores vertical connections, full polyomino validation, and multi-step deduction.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Polyominoes must be exactly the size of the number (e.g., a 5 requires exactly five connected 5's; no more, no less), and same-number polyominoes cannot touch orthogonally even if separate groups.
 * 8s are empty cells to be filled; 1s appear to serve as fixed boundaries or walls that cannot be part of polyominoes (they block horizontal/vertical propagation and remain 1s in outputs).
 * Clues (2-9) are given primarily in the bottom row, separated by 8s, but fillings can extend vertically into upper rows; horizontal-only filling misses cases where polyominoes span rows (e.g., vertical stacks like three 2's in rows 5-7 of train1 expected output).
 * Deduction often requires looking beyond immediate bounds: if a sequence of 8s is bounded by 1s, the fill number comes from the nearest clue (left or right), but only if the sequence length matches or can connect to form the exact polyomino size; over-filling (e.g., assigning a number to a sequence longer/shorter than needed) breaks the rule.
 * Subtle: Some regions remain 8s if they are not part of any clue-based polyomino (e.g., isolated 8s between groups in train1 row2 positions 5-6 stay 8, not filled with 5). Propagation must consider both directions and avoid assuming all 8-sequences are fillable—some are "gaps" between polyominoes.
 * The bottom row (clues) is untouchable (skipped in processing), and the puzzle assumes orthogonal (up/down/left/right) connectivity only—no diagonals.
 * Edge cases: Single-cell clues (rare, but if length=1 bounded by 1s, it may copy the nearest clue directly); long 1-sequences may indicate separate regions; vertical priority over horizontal in conflicts (e.g., train1 rows 5-7 fill vertically with 2's and 6's despite horizontal 8s).
 * All attempts fail to validate polyomino sizes post-filling (e.g., no check if a filled group actually connects to exactly N cells), leading to overfills or wrong numbers.
 * Grids vary in size (20x20 for train1/2, 27x27 for train3), so dimension handling is key, but processing only upper rows (skipping bottom) is correct but insufficient without vertical logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
```
(This is a simple, correct utility for getting grid height/width; useful for iteration bounds.)

The main `program` function is an attempt at filling logic but is broken overall (see below); it correctly identifies horizontal 8-sequences but fails on number selection and vertical integration. No other helper functions are provided, but a potential useful addition could be a function to find nearest clue horizontally/vertically:
```python
def find_nearest_clue(g: List[List[int]], row: int, col: int, direction: str) -> int:
    # Example stub: search left/right/up/down from (row, col) for first 2-9, skipping 1s and 8s
    # Return 0 if none found
    pass
```
(This is conceptual; not in the attempt but would help for better propagation than the attempt's buggy left/right search.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and skips the bottom clue row, uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, and properly detects horizontal sequences of 8s bounded by non-8s (e.g., correctly fills the two 2's in train1 row2/3 bounded by 1s, matching expected).
 * It works for simple cases where a horizontal 8-sequence is directly bounded by matching clues >1 (e.g., partial matches in train1 for 7's in row2/3), and sometimes picks the right number from left/right when bounded by 1s (e.g., 3's in train9/10).
 * However, it fails to handle vertical propagation entirely—no code for checking/connecting across rows, leading to misses like the vertical 2's and 6's in train1 rows5-7 (generated keeps 8s, expected fills them) and vertical 6's in train3 rows13-17 (generated all 8s, expected 6's in col11).
 * Bug in bound detection: The left/right bound finding loops incorrectly extend bounds if adjacent 8s (e.g., in train1 row2, it over-extends left/right for the 5-clue area, filling positions 5-6 with 5's where expected 8,8 as a gap).
 * Flawed 1-bounded logic: When bounded by 1s, it prefers left clue but only if left 1-sequence length==1, else right— this is arbitrary and wrong (e.g., in train1 row9, it picks 9 for a sequence that should be 3 from left, and fills 6's correctly but in wrong spot; in train2 row2, it leaves 3's as 1's instead of filling adjacent 8? Wait, input unclear but generated has 1,2,1,2 instead of expected 1,2,1,2 but misses later 3/8).
 * In train3, it fills upper horizontal groups (e.g., 3's and 2's in row3) but completely ignores lower vertical stacks (e.g., expected 6's in rows13-17 col11 stay 8s; expected 4's in row9 col14-16 become wrong 6,1,1 or similar—mismatch in positioning).
 * Over-filling issue: Fills sequences longer than the clue (e.g., train1 row9 fills four 9's? but clue is 9, yet expected uses 3's instead, suggesting vertical or size mismatch not checked).
 * The while-loop for sequence detection skips non-8 cells correctly but doesn't revisit after filling (no iterative propagation), so partial fills don't trigger further changes (e.g., train2 misses filling after initial 8's to 3/4).
 * Function `program` is partially helpful for horizontal detection but broken for full solving (don't reuse without vertical logic and validation); the inner left/right clue search is unhelpful/buggy as it skips 1s but doesn't search vertically or validate size.
 * All training examples incorrect: Train1 mismatches in filled gaps (e.g., extra 5's/9's where 8's/3's expected) and misses verticals; Train2 mismatches in partial horizontals (e.g., generated 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,3 but expected 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,8 and vertical 3/4/6/7/9 in row4/6); Train3 mismatches in verticals (e.g., no 6's or 4's in lower rows) and some horizontals (e.g., row9 has 6,1,1,6,6,6 but expected 6,1,1,4,4,4).
 * Unknown reasons for some mismatches (e.g., why train1 row10 fills 8,8,8 with 6's correctly but row9 overfills 9's—possibly bound detection error in while l >=0 and g[i][l]==8).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-fills nearly the entire grid with groups of five 2's (e.g., rows2-6 have long horizontal 2,2,2,2,2 sequences bounded by 1s), but this ignores clue sizes in the bottom row (e.g., clues like 4,9,4,7,6,9 require exact polyominoes of those sizes, not all 2's; a group of five 2's would need to be part of ten 2's total for validity, but no such connection exists).
 * It treats borders as all 1s (e.g., row0 all 1s, many rows starting/ending with 1s), suggesting the input had 8s replaced indiscriminately, but expected should leave gaps as 1s or 8s and form vertical/horizontal polyominoes matching bottom clues (e.g., a 9-clue should have nine connected 9's spanning rows, not scattered 2's or 9's in single positions like row3 col22).
 * Wrong numbers in key spots: e.g., row17 has 2,2,9,2,2 but a 9 should connect to eight more 9's (not isolated); row18 has scattered higher numbers (9,4,2,2,5,2,2,3,2,2) that don't form valid polyominoes (e.g., single 9 can't be valid). This indicates the horizontal-only logic failed on a larger/wider grid (29 cols?), creating artificial 1-boundaries and ignoring vertical needs.
 * To handle test, must add vertical search/propagation and size validation (e.g., after filling a group, count connected same-number cells == number value).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style logic puzzle on a grid with walls (cells marked 1, which block regions), clue cells (numbers 2-9 indicating the exact size of the connected region that cell belongs to), and empty cells (marked 8, to be filled with numbers 2-9 such that all connected cells sharing the same number form a polyomino of exactly that size, without crossing walls or clues mismatched to their regions). The goal is to deduce and fill all 8s logically based on clues and constraints, ensuring no region violates size rules, clues are satisfied, and the grid is fully resolved without isolated cells or overflows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (1s) act as barriers; regions cannot connect across or include 1s, and 1s themselves are not part of any numbered region.
 * Clues (2-9) must be the starting point for a region of exactly that many connected cells ( orthogonally adjacent, no diagonals), all filled with the same number as the clue; no two different clues can be in the same region unless they match in value and size constraints.
 * Empty cells (8s) must be filled to extend regions logically; single-cell regions are impossible since clues start at 2, so all 8s must connect to existing clues or form new regions only if deducible (but typically all connect back to clues).
 * Horizontal and vertical fillings must consider adjacent clues and skipped walls (1s between sequences of 8s), but cannot assume fills without verifying total region size; over-filling (e.g., long chains of the same number exceeding the clue value) violates rules.
 * Special cases for all-8 rows: These may need targeted filling based on bottom clues (e.g., if a specific clue like bottom[13]==9 triggers patterns), but must avoid assuming offsets without bounds checking; even/odd indexing for offsets risks skipping or duplicating fills.
 * Subtle deduction rules: When 8s are bounded by clues on left/right (or up/down), fill with the matching clue if sizes align (e.g., equal clues with no/minimal skipped 1s); if unequal, prefer the closer/bounding clue or use length of 8s sequence to decide (e.g., short sequences like length=1 or 2 favor smaller/nearer clues, but only if total region won't exceed); symmetric cases (equal skipped 1s) require checking sequence length against clue (e.g., length=3 with 1 skipped might take max/min based on puzzle norms).
 * Avoid naive fills: Do not fill entire sequences of 8s with a single number without counting total connected cells (including vertical/horizontal extensions); this can create oversized regions (e.g., five 2s in a row is invalid for size 2).
 * Grid structure: Clues often in bottom/top rows separated by 1s; upper grid has blocks of 1s (solid walls) and open areas with 8s; fills must propagate across rows/columns without leaving isolated 8s.
 * Edge cases: Zero skipped 1s allows direct propagation from one side; multiple skipped 1s (e.g., 1 or 2) may block or weight toward one clue; clues like 9 may indicate large regions spanning multiple rows.
 * Full resolution: Program must iterate fills (horizontal then vertical, possibly multiple passes) until no 8s remain; partial fills (leftover 8s) indicate incomplete logic.
 * No diagonals or wrapping; regions are strictly orthogonal polyominoes.

    # (Implementation as in attempt, but note: similar partial logic issues)
    # ...
    return g
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `fill_all8_rows`: Broken due to index out of range errors (e.g., accessing offset_cols[ii-1] when ii exceeds len(offset_cols), or assuming fixed indices like g[h-2][13]==9 without grid validation); overly specific to unconfirmed patterns (e.g., even/odd ii for offsets +3 from clues); does not generally help deduce regions and causes crashes—remove or heavily refactor.
 * No region size validation function: All attempts lack a post-fill check to ensure no region exceeds its number (critical flaw); without this, fills are speculative and invalid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (no prior ones detailed) focused on horizontal/vertical filling of 8 sequences bounded by clues, with heuristics for unequal clues (prefer nearer/bounding, adjust by skipped 1s and sequence length) and special all-8 row handling, but failed entirely on training examples due to index errors in `fill_all8_rows` (out of range on offset_cols and fixed [13] access, likely from assuming clue positions without bounds checks).
 * What worked: For the test input, it successfully ran without error and filled many 8s into 2s (e.g., horizontal stretches of five 2s in multiple rows, like rows 1-5 and 8-11), and placed some higher numbers (e.g., 4 at [3][3], 9 at [3][22], 6 at [10][3], 7 at [10][10], 4 at [10][22], 9 at [11][22], 2s extended in lower sections like rows 15-20 with added 9/4/5/3 placements); this shows basic detection of 8 sequences and clue propagation for small/default fills (2s as fallback?).
 * What didn't work: Training examples 1-3 all crashed with "list assignment index out of range" (likely in `fill_all8_rows` when computing/iterating offset_cols or accessing g[h-2][13] on smaller/variable grids); no training passes, indicating non-robust code. For test, filling is incomplete (e.g., row 27 still has an 8 at position 3), and logic is flawed—long horizontal 2-runs (e.g., five connected 2s in row 1 cols 1-5) create invalid regions (size 5 > 2, violating Fillomino rules); vertical connections (e.g., stacked 2s across rows 1-5 in col 1) would compound to even larger invalid regions. Heuristics for fill_n (e.g., taking max/min for length=3 with skipped=1, or preferring left if skipped_left < skipped_right) are ad-hoc and over-aggressive, ignoring total region size; symmetric cases (equal clues/skipped) have inconsistent rules (e.g., min vs max in vertical vs horizontal). No iteration for propagating fills across directions, leaving deductions partial. `fill_all8_rows` contributed nothing useful here (no all-8 rows filled specially, and it may have skipped due to conditions like g[h-2][13]==9 not met).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates partial grasp of bounding clues and sequence filling but misses core region validation, leading to invalid outputs; errors prevent any training success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially filled the grid (e.g., upper blocks like rows 1-6 and 8-13 have patterns of 1s separating stretches of five 2s, with isolated higher numbers like 4/9/6/7 inserted; lower sections rows 15-20 mirror this with 2s and 5/3/9/4; solid 1-rows at 0,6-7,13-14,20-21,25-26,28 act as barriers) but does not look correct overall.
 * Issues: Many 2-fills create oversized regions (e.g., row 1: 2s at cols 1-5 connect horizontally to size 5 >2; vertically, col 1 has 2s in rows 1-5,8-11,15-20 stacking to size 15+ >2, invalid); this suggests the program defaulted to 2s for unknown/bounded 8s without size checks. Higher placements (e.g., 9 at row 3 col 22, 5 at row 17 col 16) might align with nearby clues (bottom row has 9s/5s), but without full connectivity check, they could be wrong (e.g., if the 9-region doesn't reach size 9). Incomplete: Row 27 retains an 8 (at col 3, between 4 and 1,9 clues), meaning deduction failed there—likely needs vertical propagation from above or better bounding logic. Expected output should have no 8s left, all regions exactly matching their number (e.g., 2s only in isolated domino pairs, 9s in nonominoes connecting to clue positions), and no overflows; this output violates that by over-filling 2s and leaving gaps, so it mismatches a correct resolution (difference likely due to lack of region counting and multi-pass deduction).

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...

**High level:** This is a region-filling puzzle on a grid where 1's serve as impassable boundaries (walls), 8's are empty cells to be filled, and clue numbers (2-9) are seeds placed within regions; the goal is to identify each connected region (4-way adjacent non-1 cells) bounded by 1's or grid edges, and fill all 8's in that region with the single clue number (2-9) present in it, leaving single-cell regions (like bottom-row clues separated by 8's) unchanged except for their clue.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) groups of 8's and exactly one clue per region; filling must propagate the clue to all connected 8's within the boundaries, even for non-rectangular or L-shaped regions spanning multiple rows/columns.
 * 1's block propagation entirely and are never changed; 8's on the grid edges or outside regions may remain 8's if not part of a fillable region.
 * Bottom row typically contains isolated single-cell regions with clues (2-9) separated by 8's, which stay as-is (clue in place, adjacent 8's unfilled since they may be boundaries or separate).
 * Assume exactly one clue (2-9) per region; no overwriting of existing clues or handling multiple clues per region (puzzle validity assumes this).
 * Propagation must handle vertical, horizontal, and turning connections (e.g., a clue in one row filling adjacent columns in another row); straight-line run filling alone misses complex shapes.
 * Iterative passes (horiz then vert) can approximate propagation but fail if not checking connectivity fully, as runs may not align with region bounds (e.g., bounded by 1's instead of matching clues).
 * Unfilled 8's in generated outputs often indicate missed vertical propagation or regions bounded by 1's (not same >1 clues).
 * Clues like 2-9 in bottom row do not propagate upward unless connected through a region (rarely, as they are isolated).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 20x20 in ex1-2, 27x27? in ex3), with borders often all-8 rows/columns that remain 8's.
 * Subtle: Some regions span multiple rows but are vertically bounded by 1's (e.g., rows 2-3 only), so no spillover to adjacent all-8 rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The previous attempt's `get_dimensions` is useful for getting grid size. No other functions from the attempt are helpful, as the core logic (run-based filling) is flawed for regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt used iterative (20 passes) horizontal and vertical run-filling: finds consecutive 8's in a row/column, extends to find bounding cells, and fills the run only if bounds are identical numbers >1; this worked partially for straight horizontal runs adjacent to clues >1 (e.g., ex1 row2 cols2-3 filled as 2,2; cols8-9 as 5,5; cols15-16 as 7,7; ex2 row2 col2=2 single; ex3 row3 col3=3 single, col11=2 single).
 * Failed completely for regions bounded by 1's (not >1 clues), leaving runs of 8's unfilled (e.g., ex1 row2 cols11-13 stayed 8,8,8 instead of 7,7,7 from a nearby 7 clue in the same row-bounded region; ex3 row3 cols6-8 stayed 1,1,1? but expected 3,3,3 from horizontal propagation within 1-bounded region).
 * Missed all vertical propagation into all-8 areas adjacent to filled rows (e.g., ex1 rows5-7 cols2-3 stayed 8's instead of 2,2; rows5-7 cols15-16 stayed 8's instead of 6,6; ex2 row4 col2 stayed 8 instead of 3; row6 col4-5 stayed 1,4,1? but expected 4,4 from vertical; ex3 rows13-17 col11 stayed 8's? but expected 6's vertically).
 * Did not handle region connectivity across turns/corners (e.g., ex1 row9 cols5-6=3,3 filled horizontally, but if vertically connected, would miss; ex3 row9 cols16-18=4,4,4 expected but gen missed vertical from row10? gen row10 has 1,1,6,1,1 but no full fill).
 * Bottom row clues stayed correctly unfilled around them (e.g., all examples kept isolated 2-9 with surrounding 8's as 8's), as bounds were 8's or edges (condition left_c == right_c >1 not met).
 * Worked for some isolated singles (e.g., ex2 row2 col6=3; ex3 row3 col20=9), but over-relied on bounds matching clues, ignoring 1-bounded regions.
 * Function `fill_horizontal` and `fill_vertical` are broken for this puzzle: they only fill straight runs bounded by matching >1 clues, useless for 1-bounded or multi-direction regions (do not use in future; replace with flood fill).
 * `program` iteration helped propagate some chained horizontal fills but stalled on vertical or bounded cases (e.g., ex1 filled initial 2's/5's/7's but no further).
 * Ex1: Generated mismatched 7's (cols11-13 row2-3=8's vs expected 7's; cols13 row2=8 vs 7; vertical 2's/6's in rows5-7=8's vs expected filled; row9 cols5-6=3,3 correct but row10 cols5-6=3,3 correct? wait gen row10=1,3,3,1 correct; row13 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 9,9?; row14 cols15-16=2,2 correct but reason unknown).
 * Ex2: Mismatched vertical fills (row4 col2=8 vs 3; row4 col10=8 vs 6; row4 col14=8 vs 7; row6 cols4-5=1,4,1? gen 1,4,1 but expected 4,4 vertical from row6 col4=4 seed?; row2 col4=8 vs 2).
 * Ex3: Mismatched horizontal extensions in 1-bounded regions (row3 cols3=3 single vs extended 3's at cols6-8; row9 cols16-18=1,1,1? vs 4,4,4; vertical 6's in rows13-17 col11=8's vs expected 6's; row6 col20=8 vs 9; row18-22 cols20-22=8's vs 7?).
 * `deepcopy` is helpful to avoid mutating input but irrelevant to core logic failure.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrated partial understanding of line-filling but zero grasp of full region flood fill, leading to all training failures; no extraction functions present, but one could be added for regions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows excessive horizontal filling with 2's in long runs bounded by 1's (e.g., row1 cols1-5=2's, row3 cols1-3=2's and cols5-6=2's around a 4 seed without overwriting or unifying the region, row10 cols1-5=2's, row16 cols1-5=2's and cols14-18=2's around 2's but with 5 at col16, row18 cols1-3=2's around 9/4 but kept separate), which suggests the run-filling logic applied blindly without checking region clues or vertical connections.
 * It preserves seeds like 4 (row3 col3), 9 (row3 col22), 6 (row10 col3), 7 (row10 col11), but fills adjacent 8's with 2's incorrectly if those seeds define different regions (e.g., row3 has 4 and 9 isolated but surrounded by 2-fills, implying wrong clue propagation; likely the 2's come from nearby seeds, but verticals like row16-17 cols14-18=2's may miss extensions from row18's 3/5/etc.).
 * Bottom row (row27?) has [1,4,1,8,1,9,...] with 1's as bounds? but fills none around singles, which is partially correct for isolation but wrong if any vertical regions exist above; overall, it looks like partial horizontal fills without full region awareness, leaving potential vertical/mixed connections (e.g., row8 all 1's? vs possible bounds, row15 all 1's) unfilled or mismatched—does not match puzzle rules, as regions with clues like 3/5/7 in row18 should fill connected 8's above/beside, not default to 2's.

[2025-10-02 16:30:17] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 16:31:43] Response:
### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all provided configurations (train inputs/outputs and test inputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in *every* example (across all train pairs and test inputs). Interactions are described factually without inference to rules, mechanisms, or outcomes beyond direct observation. No high-level interpretations or solutions are included. Only elements with clear, repeated connections (e.g., nesting, spatial overlap, property changes) are noted; irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated bottom-row squares with no demonstrated effect on other components) are excluded. Unknown or inconsistent aspects (e.g., exact reasons for color matching in additions, vertical vs. horizontal preferences) are flagged as such.

1. **Frame-Inner Nesting (Spatial Containment and Sizing)**:
   - Frames (larger bbox, holes=1, colors: Blue in train 1/2/3; Red in test 1; Maroon in test 2) consistently contain exactly one inner shape (smaller bbox fully nested within frame's bbox, holes=0, solid fill).
   - Interaction: Inner bbox is always centered within frame bbox (e.g., frame [1,1,4,4] contains inner [2,2,3,3]; frame [1,1,5,5] contains inner [3,3,3,3]). Inner size (pixels) is consistently smaller (1-4 pixels) relative to frame (8-24 pixels), occupying the central hole of the frame.
   - Effect: This nesting reduces the effective hole count in the frame (from potential full enclosure to 1 remaining hole around the inner). Observed in every frame across all configs; no exceptions.

2. **Foreground Additions and Background Pixel/Hole Reduction**:
   - New foreground elements (added in all train outputs; absent in test inputs) are small bars or extended shapes (pixels=1-6, holes=0, bbox spanning 1-3 units in x or y, colors matching existing inners).
   - Interaction: These additions are positioned adjacent to or between existing frames/inners in the same row (shared y-range, e.g., y=2-3 or y=9), without nesting in frames.
   - Effect on background: Background (full-canvas bbox, high holes=7-22, color Maroon in trains/Blue in tests, high pixels=175-573) consistently loses pixels exactly equal to the total pixels of added foreground elements (e.g., train 1: +28 foreground pixels, background -32 ≈ match accounting for minor discrepancies; train 2: +6, -6; train 3: +15, -15). Background holes also decrease (by 5-7 per config), correlating with addition count but not exactly 1:1 (unknown precise mapping). No such additions in test inputs, so background unchanged there.

3. **Row-Based Positional Alignment (Grid Structure)**:
   - Elements group into horizontal rows by shared y-bbox ranges (e.g., top row y=1-5; middle rows y=7-12 or y=8-11; lower rows y=13-19 or y=15-21; bottom reference row y=18/25/27/28).
   - Interaction: Frames and inners in the same row have non-overlapping x-bbox but aligned y-bbox (e.g., train 1 top row: frames at x=1-4, 7-10, 14-17 all y=1-4). Additions (in train outputs) align y with the row and extend x to bridge gaps between frames/inners in that row only.
   - Effect: Maintains row integrity; no cross-row interactions observed (e.g., no vertical bridging between rows in every config). Consistent across all configs, including tests (no additions, but row alignment holds).

4. **Color Propagation in Additions**:
   - Added elements (train outputs only) use colors from existing inners in the same row (e.g., train 1: Dark Red addition near Dark Red inner; train 3: Green addition near Green inner).
   - Interaction: Addition color directly matches at least one adjacent inner's color in the row (position-based proximity in x, same y-range).
   - Effect: No change to original inners or frames; additions remain independent but color-linked. Consistent in all train outputs; tests have no additions, so no effect observed.

5. **Background Enclosure of All Foreground**:
   - Background bbox fully encloses all other elements (e.g., [0,0,19,19] contains all in train 1/2; [0,0,28,28] in test 1).
   - Interaction: Foreground positions (frames, inners, additions) are subsets of background bbox, with no overlap between foreground elements themselves (except nesting).
   - Effect: Foreground presence consistently "subtracts" from background pixels/holes (as in #2); background color remains uniform (Maroon or Blue) unaffected by foreground colors. Observed in every config.

### Notes on Unknown/Inconsistent Aspects
- Exact trigger for additions (e.g., why some rows get horizontal extensions and others vertical, or why specific gaps are bridged) is unknown; not consistent across all rows in every config.
- Hole count changes in frames remain fixed at 1 (no interaction with additions); background hole reductions correlate with additions but vary slightly (e.g., -7 for 6 additions in train 1 vs. -6 for 6 in train 2).
- Bottom-row small squares (1 pixel, linear x-positions) have no demonstrated interaction with upper grid (unchanged in trains, no position/color effects on frames/inners/additions); excluded as irrelevant to connections.
- Frame color shifts (Blue → Red → Maroon across configs) have no consistent effect on inners or additions (unknown linkage).
- Pixel counts for additions do not always match bbox area exactly (e.g., train 1 Dark Red bbox width=2 height=1 but pixels=6); possible rendering artifact, but no consistent interaction explained.

[2025-10-02 16:31:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all provided configurations (train inputs/outputs and test inputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in *every* example (across all train pairs and test inputs). Interactions are described factually without inference to rules, mechanisms, or outcomes beyond direct observation. No high-level interpretations or solutions are included. Only elements with clear, repeated connections (e.g., nesting, spatial overlap, property changes) are noted; irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated bottom-row squares with no demonstrated effect on other components) are excluded. Unknown or inconsistent aspects (e.g., exact reasons for color matching in additions, vertical vs. horizontal preferences) are flagged as such.

1. **Frame-Inner Nesting (Spatial Containment and Sizing)**:
   - Frames (larger bbox, holes=1, colors: Blue in train 1/2/3; Red in test 1; Maroon in test 2) consistently contain exactly one inner shape (smaller bbox fully nested within frame's bbox, holes=0, solid fill).
   - Interaction: Inner bbox is always centered within frame bbox (e.g., frame [1,1,4,4] contains inner [2,2,3,3]; frame [1,1,5,5] contains inner [3,3,3,3]). Inner size (pixels) is consistently smaller (1-4 pixels) relative to frame (8-24 pixels), occupying the central hole of the frame.
   - Effect: This nesting reduces the effective hole count in the frame (from potential full enclosure to 1 remaining hole around the inner). Observed in every frame across all configs; no exceptions.

2. **Foreground Additions and Background Pixel/Hole Reduction**:
   - New foreground elements (added in all train outputs; absent in test inputs) are small bars or extended shapes (pixels=1-6, holes=0, bbox spanning 1-3 units in x or y, colors matching existing inners).
   - Interaction: These additions are positioned adjacent to or between existing frames/inners in the same row (shared y-range, e.g., y=2-3 or y=9), without nesting in frames.
   - Effect on background: Background (full-canvas bbox, high holes=7-22, color Maroon in trains/Blue in tests, high pixels=175-573) consistently loses pixels exactly equal to the total pixels of added foreground elements (e.g., train 1: +28 foreground pixels, background -32 ≈ match accounting for minor discrepancies; train 2: +6, -6; train 3: +15, -15). Background holes also decrease (by 5-7 per config), correlating with addition count but not exactly 1:1 (unknown precise mapping). No such additions in test inputs, so background unchanged there.

3. **Row-Based Positional Alignment (Grid Structure)**:
   - Elements group into horizontal rows by shared y-bbox ranges (e.g., top row y=1-5; middle rows y=7-12 or y=8-11; lower rows y=13-19 or y=15-21; bottom reference row y=18/25/27/28).
   - Interaction: Frames and inners in the same row have non-overlapping x-bbox but aligned y-bbox (e.g., train 1 top row: frames at x=1-4, 7-10, 14-17 all y=1-4). Additions (in train outputs) align y with the row and extend x to bridge gaps between frames/inners in that row only.
   - Effect: Maintains row integrity; no cross-row interactions observed (e.g., no vertical bridging between rows in every config). Consistent across all configs, including tests (no additions, but row alignment holds).

4. **Color Propagation in Additions**:
   - Added elements (train outputs only) use colors from existing inners in the same row (e.g., train 1: Dark Red addition near Dark Red inner; train 3: Green addition near Green inner).
   - Interaction: Addition color directly matches at least one adjacent inner's color in the row (position-based proximity in x, same y-range).
   - Effect: No change to original inners or frames; additions remain independent but color-linked. Consistent in all train outputs; tests have no additions, so no effect observed.

5. **Background Enclosure of All Foreground**:
   - Background bbox fully encloses all other elements (e.g., [0,0,19,19] contains all in train 1/2; [0,0,28,28] in test 1).
   - Interaction: Foreground positions (frames, inners, additions) are subsets of background bbox, with no overlap between foreground elements themselves (except nesting).
   - Effect: Foreground presence consistently "subtracts" from background pixels/holes (as in #2); background color remains uniform (Maroon or Blue) unaffected by foreground colors. Observed in every config.

### Notes on Unknown/Inconsistent Aspects
- Exact trigger for additions (e.g., why some rows get horizontal extensions and others vertical, or why specific gaps are bridged) is unknown; not consistent across all rows in every config.
- Hole count changes in frames remain fixed at 1 (no interaction with additions); background hole reductions correlate with additions but vary slightly (e.g., -7 for 6 additions in train 1 vs. -6 for 6 in train 2).
- Bottom-row small squares (1 pixel, linear x-positions) have no demonstrated interaction with upper grid (unchanged in trains, no position/color effects on frames/inners/additions); excluded as irrelevant to connections.
- Frame color shifts (Blue → Red → Maroon across configs) have no consistent effect on inners or additions (unknown linkage).
- Pixel counts for additions do not always match bbox area exactly (e.g., train 1 Dark Red bbox width=2 height=1 but pixels=6); possible rendering artifact, but no consistent interaction explained.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 16:47:38] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify background, detect framed blocks containing inner colored regions, extract a sequence of colors from a key row at the bottom, match inners to that sequence, and connect consecutive matched inners with paths of their color—horizontally within blocks and vertically between blocks, including shifting rows for multi-connection gaps. The output is the modified grid with these connections filled in, preserving the original structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the entire grid; all other colors represent objects, frames, or keys.
 * Blocks are vertical stacks of at least 2 consecutive non-background rows; they represent framed regions, and frames are detected as the dominant non-background color in uniform rows within a block (fallback to most frequent non-bg).
 * Inner regions are contiguous horizontal runs of the same non-background, non-frame color within blocks; these are merged vertically if they align in x-range and color, forming rectangular inners.
 * The key row is the bottommost row (scanning downward) with 3-12 isolated runs of non-background cells (total non-bg <=15), treated as single-cell colors in left-to-right order to form the sequence.
 * Inners are assigned to the sequence by matching colors, preferring leftmost unused inner for duplicates.
 * Connections: Horizontal gaps between same-block inners are filled directly if adjacent in x; vertical connections between different blocks use overlapping x-ranges in the gap rows between blocks, but for height-2 gaps with multiple connections, shift the lower block up by 1 row, fill the new single gap row with all connections (overlapping fills), and update positions.
 * Subtleties: Vertical plans only fill if x-overlap exists and gap rows are available; after shifts, remaining verticals are filled straightforwardly. Assume singles in key row (skip one after each non-bg). Fallback key row is h-2 if no match. No diagonal or non-rectangular fills. Preserve bg in fills only if empty.
 * Edge cases: No inners or short sequence skips output. Blocks sorted by y_start. Global updates for shifts affect blocks, key_row, and lower plans. Height-2 multi-conn shifts only bottom-to-top processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) implements a full pipeline for detecting bg, blocks, frames, inners, key row/sequence, assignment, and connections (horizontal direct, vertical with height-2 shift for multiples), but fails entirely due to a Python syntax error: "global key_row" is declared after key_row is used (in the shift logic), causing execution errors in all training examples and test.
 * What worked: Core detection functions (bg, blocks, inners, key row, sequence, assignment) appear logically sound based on puzzle rules; horizontal fills and basic vertical fills would likely work if executed; shift logic attempts to handle multi-connections in tight gaps by inserting space via row shift.
 * What didn't work: The global declaration bug crashes everything before any output; no actual grid modifications occur, so all results are errors instead of grids. Key row update in shifts uses global but is post-use. Assumes single-cell key entries (j +=1 after append), which may miss multi-cell keys. Vertical x-overlap is max(start)-min(end), which could be empty if no overlap. No handling for same-color inners in different blocks without vertical gaps. Fallback frame detection may pick inners as frame if no uniform rows.
 * The main program structure is helpful for future but needs bug fixes; inner extraction via temp_inners and grouping is essential for merging rectangles.
 * No prior attempts, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of sequencing and connections but zero execution success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error, not a grid, so it does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution; expected is a modified grid with connections filled, but nothing generates due to the crash.
 * Specifically, the error prevents any observation of whether detections (e.g., inners, sequence) or fills (e.g., horizontals, verticals with shifts) work for the test input; without running, we can't confirm if the logic would produce correct paths (e.g., if test has height-2 multi-conns needing shift, or non-overlapping verticals to skip).
 * The error output is identical across all examples, indicating the bug is universal and blocks all progress; test likely needs the shift logic (if multi-conns present) or basic verticals, but we can't verify differences from expected without fixed execution—assume incorrect until fixed and outputs grids.

- **Colored squares**: Primary elements are nested squares with solid fills in colors including red, green, blue, yellow, orange, pink, purple, and maroon; inner squares vary in size and position within blue, red, or maroon outer borders.
- **Grid arrangements**: 3x3 matrices of bordered squares in the main puzzle areas, with partial or incomplete rows in some sections; additional linear rows of small, unbordered colored squares at the bottom of inputs.
- **Borders and outlines**: Consistent blue borders around outer squares in inputs (forming a frame-like structure); red borders in the output; some vertical and horizontal lines connecting squares in the second input, suggesting paths or extensions.
- **Color patterns**: Inputs show progression of inner colors (e.g., red/orange/purple, green/blue/pink, yellow/red) with a bottom legend of 8 small colors; output features red-bordered squares with tiny inner dots or squares in varied colors (yellow, maroon, cyan, blue, etc.), arranged in a 3x3 with extras.
- **Structural variations**: Inputs include standalone nested squares and connected elements (e.g., vertical bars in second input); output shifts to red theme with embedded micro-squares and a bottom row of 8 small colors in yellow, maroon, cyan, magenta, pink, cyan, yellow, orange, green, magenta.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 16:48:01] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and their properties that show clear, consistent interactions or effects across **all** provided examples (train inputs/outputs 1-3 and test inputs 1-2). Interactions are limited to those that are obvious, directly observable in the data (e.g., via bbox overlap, adjacency, or shared properties like color), and present in **every** case without exception. I have excluded irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated pixels with no positional or color ties to others), inconsistent patterns (e.g., variable hole counts in backgrounds that don't reliably tie to specific components), and high-level interpretations. Only direct connections are noted; any transformation logic (e.g., why a specific color is chosen for a new shape) that cannot be explained consistently is marked as unknown.

#### 1. **Outer Frames and Inner Small Shapes (Nested Structure)**
   - **Components/Properties**:
     - Outer frames: Rectangular shapes with `holes=1`, large pixel counts (8-32 pixels), consistent colors (Blue in train inputs/outputs; Red or Maroon in test inputs), bbox spanning 3-6 units per side.
     - Inner small shapes: Rectangular shapes with `holes=0`, small pixel counts (1-4 pixels), varied colors (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Orange, Pink, Light Blue, Dark Red), bbox 1-2 units per side.
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - **Spatial containment**: Every inner small shape's bbox is fully centered and contained within an outer frame's bbox (e.g., outer [1,1,4,4] contains inner [2,2,3,3]; outer [1,1,5,5] contains inner [3,3,3,3]). This nesting is preserved in all train outputs for original pairs.
     - **Size dependency**: Inner shape size (bbox width/height and pixels) is consistently 1/3 to 1/2 the outer frame's effective inner space (e.g., 1-unit inner in 3-unit outer; 2-unit inner in 6-unit outer). No exceptions.
     - **Color distinction**: Inner color always differs from outer frame color (e.g., no Blue inner in Blue outer; no Red inner in Red outer). Consistent across all.
   - **Consistency Note**: Present in every input/output/test; no cases without nesting. New shapes in train outputs do not nest inside existing outers.

#### 2. **Outer Frames and Grid Adjacency (Positional Connections)**
   - **Components/Properties**:
     - Outer frames: As above, positioned in approximate 3x3 grid-like arrangement (x/y offsets in multiples of ~4-8 units, e.g., columns at x~1/7-10/14-17; rows at y~1/7-11/13-19).
     - New small shapes (in train outputs only): Rectangular shapes with `holes=0`, variable pixels (1-6), colors matching existing inners/bottom (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow), bbox 1-3 units wide/high, placed in gaps.
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - **Positional adjacency → new shape creation**: When two outer frames are horizontally or vertically adjacent (bboxes separated by <4 units, aligned in row/column), a new small shape is created in the output positioned directly between their bboxes (e.g., train 1: frames at x7-10 and x14-17 → new at x11-13; train 2: frames at x5-7 and x9-11 → new at x8). Horizontal adjacency creates wider/horizontal-oriented new shapes; vertical creates taller/vertical-oriented. No new shapes where no adjacency exists (e.g., isolated frames in train 3 bottom row have no vertical adds below).
     - **Preservation of originals**: Original frame positions and their inners are unchanged; new shapes do not overlap existing bboxes.
   - **Consistency Note**: Adjacency-based creation occurs in every train output where gaps exist (train 1-3); no such additions in inputs/tests (as expected, since tests are inputs). No horizontal/vertical adds in non-adjacent cases across all.

#### 3. **Background Shape and Small Shapes (Encompassing Structure)**
   - **Components/Properties**:
     - Background: Single large rectangular shape with high `holes` count (7-22), full-canvas bbox (e.g., [0,0,19,19] or [0,0,28,28]), high pixels (181-573), color Maroon (train) or Blue (test).
     - All small shapes (outers, inners, bottom row): As defined above and below.
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - **Spatial encompassing**: Background bbox always fully contains all other shapes' bboxes (no shape outside canvas). All small shapes occupy positions that align with background holes (e.g., hole count ≥ total small shapes in inputs).
     - **Pixel impact**: In train outputs, background pixels decrease (e.g., 264→232; 181→175; 573→558) when new small shapes are added, suggesting overlap or filling effect on background area. Hole count also decreases (e.g., 16→9), but exact tie to added shapes is unknown (not 1:1 consistent).
   - **Consistency Note**: Encompassing and pixel/hole changes occur in every train input/output pair; background always present and dominant in all examples. No pixel increase or hole addition observed.

#### 4. **Bottom Row Small Shapes (Static Reference)**
   - **Components/Properties**:
     - Bottom row: 6-10 single-pixel shapes (`pixels=1`, `holes=0`, 1x1 bbox, e.g., [1,18,1,18]), varied colors (from same set as inners), aligned linearly at bottom y-coordinate (y=11/18/25/27-28, x in odd increments ~2 units apart).
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - **Color sourcing**: Colors in bottom row are always from the same limited set as inner/new shapes (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Pink, etc.); no unique colors. New shapes in train outputs use colors present in bottom row (e.g., train 1 adds Green/Yellow, both in bottom).
     - **Positional isolation**: Bottom row bboxes do not overlap or adjoin any outer/inner bboxes; fixed at canvas bottom, unaffected by grid.
     - **No transformation**: Identical positions, sizes, colors, and count in every train input/output pair (e.g., train 1: 8 shapes unchanged).
   - **Consistency Note**: Present and unchanged in every train pair; appears in all tests with similar structure (longer rows in tests 1-2). Serves as color reference without direct positional effects on other components.

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Elements
- **Color selection for new shapes**: New shapes (from adjacency) always match a color from adjacent inners or bottom row, but which one (left/upper vs. right/lower) is not consistent (e.g., train 1 top uses right color; train 2 uses left). Cannot explain without forcing—marked unknown.
- **Border color shifts**: Descriptions note blue borders in inputs vs. red in outputs, but object lists show outer colors unchanged (Blue in train outputs). No consistent tie to other properties.
- **Hole count in outers/inners**: Outers always `holes=1`, inners/new `holes=0`, but no observable effect on other components (e.g., doesn't trigger additions consistently).
- No other interactions (e.g., no color→position changes; no hole→color effects) are consistent across all examples—many vary by puzzle size/grid completeness.

This list focuses solely on direct, observable connections without inferring puzzle rules or solutions.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 16:50:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and their properties that show clear, consistent interactions or effects across **all** provided examples (train inputs/outputs 1-3 and test inputs 1-2). Interactions are limited to those that are obvious, directly observable in the data (e.g., via bbox overlap, adjacency, or shared properties like color), and present in **every** case without exception. I have excluded irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated pixels with no positional or color ties to others), inconsistent patterns (e.g., variable hole counts in backgrounds that don't reliably tie to specific components), and high-level interpretations. Only direct connections are noted; any transformation logic (e.g., why a specific color is chosen for a new shape) that cannot be explained consistently is marked as unknown.

#### 1. **Outer Frames and Inner Small Shapes (Nested Structure)**
   - **Components/Properties**:
     - Outer frames: Rectangular shapes with `holes=1`, large pixel counts (8-32 pixels), consistent colors (Blue in train inputs/outputs; Red or Maroon in test inputs), bbox spanning 3-6 units per side.
     - Inner small shapes: Rectangular shapes with `holes=0`, small pixel counts (1-4 pixels), varied colors (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Orange, Pink, Light Blue, Dark Red), bbox 1-2 units per side.
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - **Spatial containment**: Every inner small shape's bbox is fully centered and contained within an outer frame's bbox (e.g., outer [1,1,4,4] contains inner [2,2,3,3]; outer [1,1,5,5] contains inner [3,3,3,3]). This nesting is preserved in all train outputs for original pairs.
     - **Size dependency**: Inner shape size (bbox width/height and pixels) is consistently 1/3 to 1/2 the outer frame's effective inner space (e.g., 1-unit inner in 3-unit outer; 2-unit inner in 6-unit outer). No exceptions.
     - **Color distinction**: Inner color always differs from outer frame color (e.g., no Blue inner in Blue outer; no Red inner in Red outer). Consistent across all.
   - **Consistency Note**: Present in every input/output/test; no cases without nesting. New shapes in train outputs do not nest inside existing outers.

#### 2. **Outer Frames and Grid Adjacency (Positional Connections)**
   - **Components/Properties**:
     - Outer frames: As above, positioned in approximate 3x3 grid-like arrangement (x/y offsets in multiples of ~4-8 units, e.g., columns at x~1/7-10/14-17; rows at y~1/7-11/13-19).
     - New small shapes (in train outputs only): Rectangular shapes with `holes=0`, variable pixels (1-6), colors matching existing inners/bottom (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow), bbox 1-3 units wide/high, placed in gaps.
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - **Positional adjacency → new shape creation**: When two outer frames are horizontally or vertically adjacent (bboxes separated by <4 units, aligned in row/column), a new small shape is created in the output positioned directly between their bboxes (e.g., train 1: frames at x7-10 and x14-17 → new at x11-13; train 2: frames at x5-7 and x9-11 → new at x8). Horizontal adjacency creates wider/horizontal-oriented new shapes; vertical creates taller/vertical-oriented. No new shapes where no adjacency exists (e.g., isolated frames in train 3 bottom row have no vertical adds below).
     - **Preservation of originals**: Original frame positions and their inners are unchanged; new shapes do not overlap existing bboxes.
   - **Consistency Note**: Adjacency-based creation occurs in every train output where gaps exist (train 1-3); no such additions in inputs/tests (as expected, since tests are inputs). No horizontal/vertical adds in non-adjacent cases across all.

#### 3. **Background Shape and Small Shapes (Encompassing Structure)**
   - **Components/Properties**:
     - Background: Single large rectangular shape with high `holes` count (7-22), full-canvas bbox (e.g., [0,0,19,19] or [0,0,28,28]), high pixels (181-573), color Maroon (train) or Blue (test).
     - All small shapes (outers, inners, bottom row): As defined above and below.
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - **Spatial encompassing**: Background bbox always fully contains all other shapes' bboxes (no shape outside canvas). All small shapes occupy positions that align with background holes (e.g., hole count ≥ total small shapes in inputs).
     - **Pixel impact**: In train outputs, background pixels decrease (e.g., 264→232; 181→175; 573→558) when new small shapes are added, suggesting overlap or filling effect on background area. Hole count also decreases (e.g., 16→9), but exact tie to added shapes is unknown (not 1:1 consistent).
   - **Consistency Note**: Encompassing and pixel/hole changes occur in every train input/output pair; background always present and dominant in all examples. No pixel increase or hole addition observed.

#### 4. **Bottom Row Small Shapes (Static Reference)**
   - **Components/Properties**:
     - Bottom row: 6-10 single-pixel shapes (`pixels=1`, `holes=0`, 1x1 bbox, e.g., [1,18,1,18]), varied colors (from same set as inners), aligned linearly at bottom y-coordinate (y=11/18/25/27-28, x in odd increments ~2 units apart).
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - **Color sourcing**: Colors in bottom row are always from the same limited set as inner/new shapes (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Pink, etc.); no unique colors. New shapes in train outputs use colors present in bottom row (e.g., train 1 adds Green/Yellow, both in bottom).
     - **Positional isolation**: Bottom row bboxes do not overlap or adjoin any outer/inner bboxes; fixed at canvas bottom, unaffected by grid.
     - **No transformation**: Identical positions, sizes, colors, and count in every train input/output pair (e.g., train 1: 8 shapes unchanged).
   - **Consistency Note**: Present and unchanged in every train pair; appears in all tests with similar structure (longer rows in tests 1-2). Serves as color reference without direct positional effects on other components.

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Elements
- **Color selection for new shapes**: New shapes (from adjacency) always match a color from adjacent inners or bottom row, but which one (left/upper vs. right/lower) is not consistent (e.g., train 1 top uses right color; train 2 uses left). Cannot explain without forcing—marked unknown.
- **Border color shifts**: Descriptions note blue borders in inputs vs. red in outputs, but object lists show outer colors unchanged (Blue in train outputs). No consistent tie to other properties.
- **Hole count in outers/inners**: Outers always `holes=1`, inners/new `holes=0`, but no observable effect on other components (e.g., doesn't trigger additions consistently).
- No other interactions (e.g., no color→position changes; no hole→color effects) are consistent across all examples—many vary by puzzle size/grid completeness.

This list focuses solely on direct, observable connections without inferring puzzle rules or solutions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 17:04:57] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (often 8 or 1) and colored components that form incomplete frames or outlines enclosing small inner regions; the goal is to fill gaps between adjacent or overlapping frames with a specific color chosen based on isolated color markers at the bottom of the grid, effectively completing symmetric or connected shapes while preserving the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is typically the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training examples 1-3, 1 in the test); all fills must only overwrite bg cells, never existing colors.
 * Bottom isolates are single non-bg cells in the bottom row (or near-bottom) flanked by bg on both sides; there must be at least 3 such isolates in a row to be valid, and their positions (indexed from 1) and colors guide color selection for fills via adjacency rules (e.g., choose the color whose position is minimal in adjacent pairs).
 * Frames are medium-sized connected components (5-50 cells) of a single color (frame_color, chosen as the color with the most such components); these enclose 1-8 cell inner regions of a different color, which must be identified within the frame's bounding box.
 * Fills occur between pairs of frames that overlap in one dimension (rows for horizontal pairs, columns for vertical) with a small gap (1-3 bg cells); the fill color is selected from the two inner colors based on bottom isolate adjacency, and fills only the gap rows/columns using the union or range from the inners.
 * Subtlety: Horizontal pairs fill specific rows from the union of inner colored rows; vertical pairs fill specific columns from the chosen inner's range; gaps must be exactly between frames without full overlap or large separations.
 * Overlapping frames must share the overlap dimension but have a gap in the other; inners must be exactly one per frame and small (1-8 cells) to qualify.
 * Easy to miss: Frame_color selection prioritizes medium components but may fail if multiple colors qualify; bottom isolates are only considered if >=3 in a single row; fills don't extend beyond the gap or overwrite non-bg; the bottom row itself has scattered single-color isolates (1-9) that aren't filled but guide the logic.
 * Components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right); visited tracking prevents revisiting in inner extraction.
 * Puzzle assumes a single frame_color; if none found, return unchanged grid.
 * Test input has wider grid (29 cols) and more complex nesting; bg=1, main fill color seems 2 with outliers (3-9); fills must respect multiple levels of frames.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies bg (e.g., 8 or 1) and frame_color via medium component count, and extracts bottom isolates only if >=3 in a row, which works for qualifying valid rows in all training examples.
 * find_components and identify_outers are helpful and correctly find frames/inners (e.g., detects small inners like the 7's in train1 row2-3, 2's in train2 row2-3), but pairing logic in get_pairs fails to detect all overlaps/gaps (e.g., misses horizontal overlap for 7's in train1 rows2-4 cols11-17, where gap=0 but should fill via adjacency).
 * What worked: Some vertical fills partially succeed, like extending 3's and 4's in train1 rows9-11/14-16, but incompletely (e.g., train1 row10 col5-6 filled as 3 but expected full extension); bottom isolate adjacency selection works for simple cases but ignores non-adjacent colors.
 * What didn't: No fills applied in many gap areas, leaving bg (8 or 1) where expected colors propagate (e.g., train1: rows2-4 cols11-13/15-17 remain 8 instead of 7; rows5-7 cols2-3/16-17 remain 8 instead of 2/6; row10 cols1-5/7 remain 8 instead of 3; row13 cols8-9 remain 8 instead of 9; row15 cols11-14 remain 8 instead of 4).
 * Train1 differences: Generated misses horizontal fills for 2 (rows5-7 cols2-3), 6 (rows5-7 cols16-17), 9 (row13 cols8-9), and partial 3/4 extensions; also no vertical fill for 7's across cols11-17 in rows2-4; bottom row unchanged correctly, but isolates not fully guiding all pairs.
 * Train2 differences: Generated misses fills like 2 in row2 col4/row3 col2 (expected 2 extensions); 3 in row4 col6/row6 col2? Wait, row4 is all bg except isolates, but expected 3 at row4 col6; row6 col4-5 as 4 but generated bg; row7 col4 as 4 but generated 1? No, generated has some 4/6 but misses 5 extensions in row7 col10-11? Unknown why partial—perhaps overlap check fails for vertical pairs.
 * Train3 differences: Generated has almost no fills beyond existing (e.g., misses 2 extensions in row3 cols11-15 to 2; 4 in row9 cols14-16/20-21? row10 col19-21 as 4 but generated bg; vertical 6 in rows12-16 col11 as 6 but generated bg; 9 in row6 col19 as 9 but generated bg; row18-22 almost unchanged, missing 8? fills); wider grid causes bbox issues, with inners not paired due to gap>3 or no overlap.
 * get_pairs is broken for vertical fills (e.g., fill_cols from chosen_o only, but should union or extend; overlap_check uses wrong indices for vertical); apply_fills only fills if bg but doesn't handle multi-row/col properly.
 * find_bottom_isolates is helpful but too strict (only one row checked, misses multi-row bottoms in test); get_all_pos correctly maps colors to positions but assumes single row.
 * Overall, attempt understands frame/inner extraction and bottom-guided color choice but fails on pair detection (gaps/overlaps) and fill application (wrong ranges/union), leading to under-filling; no over-filling observed.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it primarily fills large areas with 2 (e.g., rows1-6/8-13/15-? cols1-6/8-13/21-25 as 2, matching some inner 2's) but leaves many bg=1 cells unfilled where extensions are needed (e.g., row3 col6-7/13-? should extend 4/8/9 but remain 1; row10 col3-6/21-24 should extend 6/4 but partial/missing; row17-20 cols14-20/22-25 have some 2 but miss 5/3 extensions like row18 col17 as 5→full row? ; bottom row22-26 have 3/7 but no upward fills to connect).
 * It over-fills some 2 areas beyond frames (e.g., row15-16 cols14-20 as 2, but input has no inner there—perhaps false pair); ignores isolates like 8/9/4/7/6/9/4/5/3/7, only using adjacent for partial 2/4 fills, missing vertical propagations (e.g., no 6 fill in col11 rows8-14).
 * Makes sense for simple horizontal 2 fills but not for complex vertical/nested (e.g., row18 has 9/4/5/3 but no fills above); likely pairing misses small gaps or wrong overlap, leaving ~70% of expected fills undone; to handle test, need better multi-row bottom scan and union fills for vertical pairs.

[2025-10-02 17:05:16] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of components and their properties that show clear, consistent interactions or effects across **all** examples (Train 1, 2, and 3). Only obvious, verifiable connections are included—e.g., direct causal effects like position influencing placement or property modifications. Irrelevant or static elements (e.g., frames and legend squares, which never change) are noted but not treated as interacting unless they consistently affect others. No high-level puzzle logic or solutions are inferred or described. Unknowns (e.g., exact rules for color selection) are explicitly called out. Interactions must hold in every train example without exception.

#### Core Components
- **Inner Squares**: Small, solid colored rectangles (holes=0, pixels=1–4, bbox typically 1–2 units in each dimension). Colors include Red, Green, Orange, Dark Red (purple-like), Yellow, Pink, Light Blue (blue variant). Positioned inside frames or grid cells.
- **Frames**: Larger colored rectangles (holes=1, pixels=8–24, bbox 3–5 units wide/tall). Consistently Blue (Trains 1–3 input) or Red (implied in variants). Static; no changes or interactions.
- **Background**: Large enclosing rectangle (many holes: 12–16 input, reduced in output; pixels=181–573 input, reduced in output; bbox covers entire canvas, e.g., [0,0,19–26,19–26]). Color: Maroon (Trains 1–3). Covers all other elements.
- **Legend Squares**: Tiny solid colored squares (holes=0, pixels=1, bbox 0–1 unit, single-pixel-like). Positioned in a horizontal bottom row (e.g., odd x-coordinates at fixed y=11–25). Colors match or subset of inners (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Pink, etc.). 6–8 per example. Static; no changes.
- **New Bars** (output-only): Small colored rectangles added in outputs (holes=0, pixels=1–6, bbox 1–3 units in one dimension, elongated in connection direction). Colors from inner/legend palette (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Pink, Light Blue, Dark Red, Orange). Not present in inputs.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are the only connections observable in **every** train example (inputs vs. outputs). They involve direct effects like positional adjacency, property modifications, or derivations. No interactions are forced; e.g., no consistent color-to-color mappings (like Red always → Yellow) exist across all, as substitutions vary (e.g., Train 1 has Red→Yellow in one bar, but Train 2 has no such shift).

1. **Position of Inner Squares → Position of New Bars**  
   - New bars are consistently placed adjacent to or directly between the bboxes of two or more inner squares (or empty grid-adjacent positions).  
     - Example (all trains): Bars' bbox shares x- or y-coordinates with connected inners (e.g., Train 1: vertical Red bar [2,5,3,7] shares x=2–3 with top-left Red inner [2,2,3,3] and middle-left Green inner [2,9,3,10]; y=5–7 fills gap between them).  
     - Train 2: Horizontal Green bar [6,4,6,4] shares x=6 and y=4 (between rows) with top-middle Green [6,2,6,2].  
     - Train 3: Horizontal Green bar [6,3,8,3] extends x=6–8 from top-left Green inner [3,3,3,3] (shares y=3).  
   - Effect: Bars "bridge" grid gaps (e.g., between rows y=3–9 or columns x=3–11), always axis-aligned (no diagonals). Consistent in all outputs; no bars in isolated positions.  
   - Direction (horizontal/vertical) is derived from inner positions: horizontal bars extend in x (share y), vertical in y (share x). No other transformations (e.g., no rotation).

2. **Properties of New Bars → Properties of Background (Holes and Pixels)**  
   - Each new bar added consistently reduces the background's hole count by exactly 1 (regardless of bar size/color).  
     - Train 1: 7 new bars → holes 16 → 9 (decrease of 7).  
     - Train 2: 6 new bars → holes 15 → 9 (decrease of 6).  
     - Train 3: 5 new bars → holes 12 → 7 (decrease of 5).  
   - The total pixels of all new bars equals the exact decrease in background pixels (bars "cover" background area).  
     - Train 1: New bars total 32 pixels → background 264 → 232 (decrease of 32).  
     - Train 2: New bars total 6 pixels (all 1-pixel) → 181 → 175 (decrease of 6).  
     - Train 3: New bars total 15 pixels → 573 → 558 (decrease of 15).  
   - Effect: Background bbox unchanged, but internal properties (holes, pixels) are directly modified by new bars' count and size. This is the only consistent effect on background; no other components affect it.

3. **Position/Direction of New Bars → Pixels and Bbox Dimensions of New Bars**  
   - Bar pixels consistently scale with connection length/direction: longer spans (e.g., full gap between grid cells) have higher pixels (3–6); short/partial spans have 1–2.  
     - Horizontal bars: Pixels match x-span (e.g., Train 3 Green [6,3,8,3] spans 3 x-units → 3 pixels).  
     - Vertical bars: Pixels match y-span (e.g., Train 1 Red [2,5,3,7] spans 3 y-units → 6 pixels, possibly 2x3 area).  
     - Short bars: 1–2 pixels for minimal extensions (e.g., Train 2 all 1-pixel; Train 1 Light Blue [8,12,9,12] = 2 pixels for 1-unit y-gap).  
   - Bbox of bar is always a direct extension/combination of connected inners' bboxes (e.g., min/max x/y adjusted to fill gap). Consistent; no bars with mismatched dimensions.

4. **Color of Inner Squares/Legend → Color of New Bars (Partial/Unknown)**  
   - New bar color is consistently one of the colors present in connected inner squares or the legend (no new colors invented).  
     - Example: Train 1 Red bar connects Red/Green inners → Red bar; Train 3 Pink bar at [11,12,11,16] near Pink inner → Pink.  
     - Train 2: All bars match exact colors of nearby inners (e.g., Yellow bar near Yellow inner).  
   - However, exact selection rule is unknown (inconsistent which connected color is chosen; e.g., Train 1 Yellow bar connects Yellow/Red → Yellow, but Train 3 Yellow bar connects Yellow only → Yellow; no uniform mapping like "always first color"). Not forced as a full interaction due to variability.

#### Non-Interacting or Static Elements
- **Frames**: No changes or effects in any example. Holes=1, pixels, bbox, color fixed. No connections to bars or background.
- **Original Inner Squares**: Unchanged (same bbox, pixels, color, holes=0). Only indirectly "interact" via position influencing new bars (see #1).
- **Legend Squares**: Unchanged in all outputs. Positions fixed (bottom row, spaced). Colors may influence bar colors (#4, partial), but no direct positional or property effects (e.g., no bars connecting to legend; rule unknown).
- **Holes of Inners/Frames**: Always 0 (inners) or 1 (frames); no changes or effects on other properties.
- **Overall Grid Structure**: Implied 3x3 layout (bbox patterns), but incomplete in Train 3 (missing cells)—bars still connect existing inners consistently, ignoring empties unless adjacent.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., no color→position shifts, no hole effects beyond background, no silhouette/edge changes). Transformations like bar additions are position-driven but not fully explainable without unknowns (e.g., why specific pairs connect). Test inputs show similar structure (e.g., Red/Maroon frames, Blue background, more rows/legend items) but are not used for consistency checks.

[2025-10-02 17:06:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of components and their properties that show clear, consistent interactions or effects across **all** examples (Train 1, 2, and 3). Only obvious, verifiable connections are included—e.g., direct causal effects like position influencing placement or property modifications. Irrelevant or static elements (e.g., frames and legend squares, which never change) are noted but not treated as interacting unless they consistently affect others. No high-level puzzle logic or solutions are inferred or described. Unknowns (e.g., exact rules for color selection) are explicitly called out. Interactions must hold in every train example without exception.

#### Core Components
- **Inner Squares**: Small, solid colored rectangles (holes=0, pixels=1–4, bbox typically 1–2 units in each dimension). Colors include Red, Green, Orange, Dark Red (purple-like), Yellow, Pink, Light Blue (blue variant). Positioned inside frames or grid cells.
- **Frames**: Larger colored rectangles (holes=1, pixels=8–24, bbox 3–5 units wide/tall). Consistently Blue (Trains 1–3 input) or Red (implied in variants). Static; no changes or interactions.
- **Background**: Large enclosing rectangle (many holes: 12–16 input, reduced in output; pixels=181–573 input, reduced in output; bbox covers entire canvas, e.g., [0,0,19–26,19–26]). Color: Maroon (Trains 1–3). Covers all other elements.
- **Legend Squares**: Tiny solid colored squares (holes=0, pixels=1, bbox 0–1 unit, single-pixel-like). Positioned in a horizontal bottom row (e.g., odd x-coordinates at fixed y=11–25). Colors match or subset of inners (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Pink, etc.). 6–8 per example. Static; no changes.
- **New Bars** (output-only): Small colored rectangles added in outputs (holes=0, pixels=1–6, bbox 1–3 units in one dimension, elongated in connection direction). Colors from inner/legend palette (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Pink, Light Blue, Dark Red, Orange). Not present in inputs.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are the only connections observable in **every** train example (inputs vs. outputs). They involve direct effects like positional adjacency, property modifications, or derivations. No interactions are forced; e.g., no consistent color-to-color mappings (like Red always → Yellow) exist across all, as substitutions vary (e.g., Train 1 has Red→Yellow in one bar, but Train 2 has no such shift).

1. **Position of Inner Squares → Position of New Bars**  
   - New bars are consistently placed adjacent to or directly between the bboxes of two or more inner squares (or empty grid-adjacent positions).  
     - Example (all trains): Bars' bbox shares x- or y-coordinates with connected inners (e.g., Train 1: vertical Red bar [2,5,3,7] shares x=2–3 with top-left Red inner [2,2,3,3] and middle-left Green inner [2,9,3,10]; y=5–7 fills gap between them).  
     - Train 2: Horizontal Green bar [6,4,6,4] shares x=6 and y=4 (between rows) with top-middle Green [6,2,6,2].  
     - Train 3: Horizontal Green bar [6,3,8,3] extends x=6–8 from top-left Green inner [3,3,3,3] (shares y=3).  
   - Effect: Bars "bridge" grid gaps (e.g., between rows y=3–9 or columns x=3–11), always axis-aligned (no diagonals). Consistent in all outputs; no bars in isolated positions.  
   - Direction (horizontal/vertical) is derived from inner positions: horizontal bars extend in x (share y), vertical in y (share x). No other transformations (e.g., no rotation).

2. **Properties of New Bars → Properties of Background (Holes and Pixels)**  
   - Each new bar added consistently reduces the background's hole count by exactly 1 (regardless of bar size/color).  
     - Train 1: 7 new bars → holes 16 → 9 (decrease of 7).  
     - Train 2: 6 new bars → holes 15 → 9 (decrease of 6).  
     - Train 3: 5 new bars → holes 12 → 7 (decrease of 5).  
   - The total pixels of all new bars equals the exact decrease in background pixels (bars "cover" background area).  
     - Train 1: New bars total 32 pixels → background 264 → 232 (decrease of 32).  
     - Train 2: New bars total 6 pixels (all 1-pixel) → 181 → 175 (decrease of 6).  
     - Train 3: New bars total 15 pixels → 573 → 558 (decrease of 15).  
   - Effect: Background bbox unchanged, but internal properties (holes, pixels) are directly modified by new bars' count and size. This is the only consistent effect on background; no other components affect it.

3. **Position/Direction of New Bars → Pixels and Bbox Dimensions of New Bars**  
   - Bar pixels consistently scale with connection length/direction: longer spans (e.g., full gap between grid cells) have higher pixels (3–6); short/partial spans have 1–2.  
     - Horizontal bars: Pixels match x-span (e.g., Train 3 Green [6,3,8,3] spans 3 x-units → 3 pixels).  
     - Vertical bars: Pixels match y-span (e.g., Train 1 Red [2,5,3,7] spans 3 y-units → 6 pixels, possibly 2x3 area).  
     - Short bars: 1–2 pixels for minimal extensions (e.g., Train 2 all 1-pixel; Train 1 Light Blue [8,12,9,12] = 2 pixels for 1-unit y-gap).  
   - Bbox of bar is always a direct extension/combination of connected inners' bboxes (e.g., min/max x/y adjusted to fill gap). Consistent; no bars with mismatched dimensions.

4. **Color of Inner Squares/Legend → Color of New Bars (Partial/Unknown)**  
   - New bar color is consistently one of the colors present in connected inner squares or the legend (no new colors invented).  
     - Example: Train 1 Red bar connects Red/Green inners → Red bar; Train 3 Pink bar at [11,12,11,16] near Pink inner → Pink.  
     - Train 2: All bars match exact colors of nearby inners (e.g., Yellow bar near Yellow inner).  
   - However, exact selection rule is unknown (inconsistent which connected color is chosen; e.g., Train 1 Yellow bar connects Yellow/Red → Yellow, but Train 3 Yellow bar connects Yellow only → Yellow; no uniform mapping like "always first color"). Not forced as a full interaction due to variability.

#### Non-Interacting or Static Elements
- **Frames**: No changes or effects in any example. Holes=1, pixels, bbox, color fixed. No connections to bars or background.
- **Original Inner Squares**: Unchanged (same bbox, pixels, color, holes=0). Only indirectly "interact" via position influencing new bars (see #1).
- **Legend Squares**: Unchanged in all outputs. Positions fixed (bottom row, spaced). Colors may influence bar colors (#4, partial), but no direct positional or property effects (e.g., no bars connecting to legend; rule unknown).
- **Holes of Inners/Frames**: Always 0 (inners) or 1 (frames); no changes or effects on other properties.
- **Overall Grid Structure**: Implied 3x3 layout (bbox patterns), but incomplete in Train 3 (missing cells)—bars still connect existing inners consistently, ignoring empties unless adjacent.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., no color→position shifts, no hole effects beyond background, no silhouette/edge changes). Transformations like bar additions are position-driven but not fully explainable without unknowns (e.g., why specific pairs connect). Test inputs show similar structure (e.g., Red/Maroon frames, Blue background, more rows/legend items) but are not used for consistency checks.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 17:15:06] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains colored blocks (numbers 1-9 representing colors) separated by background (bg, often 8 or 1), with a legend sequence in the second-to-last row indicating an order to connect consecutive colored blocks by filling straight-line gaps (horizontal or vertical) between them using the color of the starting block in each pair, effectively merging or extending blocks to form paths or shapes matching the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend sequence is extracted from non-bg cells in the second-to-last row (n-2), representing the order of colors to connect (e.g., connect first available block of color A to first of B, then B to C, etc.).
 * Connections only fill background gaps in straight horizontal or vertical lines between bounding boxes of consecutive blocks if they align on the same row(s) or column(s); no diagonal or complex path filling.
 * Multiple blocks per color exist (e.g., several disconnected 2's), so they must be processed in positional order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting by min_r then min_c) using a queue to select the "next" available block for connection.
 * Fill only bg cells; do not overwrite existing non-bg cells, and fills should merge blocks without expanding beyond the gap between bboxes.
 * Background is always the top-left cell's value (e.g., 8 in training, 1 in test); legend skips bg in extraction.
 * Subtle: Connections may chain across the sequence, so popping/using blocks in order can leave later blocks unconnected if wrong pairs are chosen; some expected outputs show horizontal fills spanning multiple columns (e.g., 7's connecting across in ex1 row 2-3) or vertical extensions.
 * Easy to miss: Not all blocks of a color are connected in every step—only consecutive in sequence; leftover blocks remain unchanged. Also, bboxes must be precise (min/max r/c of connected components via flood-fill/DFS/stack).
 * Grids have frame-like 1's in some cases (e.g., outlining shapes), which should not be filled into unless part of a connection.
 * In test case, bg=1 acts as both frame and separator, so fills must distinguish carefully to avoid merging unintended areas.
 * Sequence length is len(legend)-1 connections; process sequentially without revisiting.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills entire row/col spans between bboxes, but if bboxes don't perfectly align (e.g., partial overlap), it may fill extra or miss (e.g., ex1 misses 5-to-7 horizontal merge).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg from top-left; essential and works in all cases.)

```python
def extract_legend(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    return [g[n-2][c] for c in range(m) if g[n-2][c] != bg]
```
(This accurately pulls the sequence from row n-2, skipping bg; works perfectly in examples, e.g., ex1 seq=[2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5].)

```python
def find_connected_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    blocks: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]] = defaultdict(list)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(m):
            if g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                col = g[r][c]
                min_r = max_r = r
                min_c = max_c = c
                stack = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    rr, cc = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, rr)
                    max_r = max(max_r, rr)
                    min_c = min(min_c, cc)
                    max_c = max(max_c, cc)
                    for dr, dc in dirs:
                        nr = rr + dr
                        nc = cc + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == col:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                blocks[col].append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return blocks
```
(This flood-fills to find connected components and their bounding boxes correctly; essential for identifying blocks, works in all cases without errors.)

```python
def sort_blocks_by_position(blocks: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]:
    for col in blocks:
        blocks[col] = sorted(blocks[col], key=lambda bbox: (bbox[0], bbox[2]))
    return blocks
```
(This sorts bboxes per color by top row then left col, enabling queue-based "first available" selection; helpful and correct, but may need refinement for multi-block ordering.)

```python
def fill_horizontal_gap(g: List[List[int]], left_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], right_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], fill_col: int, bg: int) -> None:
    min_r = left_bbox[0]
    max_r = left_bbox[1]
    start_c = left_bbox[3] + 1
    end_c = right_bbox[2]

```
(These fill straight gaps correctly if bboxes align, using start color; helpful but limited—only works for perfect row/col alignment, misses partial overlaps or non-straight needs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core connection logic is flawed despite good block detection.
 * Ex1 generated: Connected some 1-5 and 1-7 vertically/horizontally in upper sections (e.g., filled 1's around 2/5/7), but missed key horizontal merges like 5-to-7 in rows 2-3 (generated has separate 5's and 7's; expected connects 7's across cols 11-16 with 7 fills), 1-to-3 in rows 9-10 (generated leaves gap; expected fills 3's into col5-6), and bottom 4-to-2 (generated no fill; expected 4's extend to col13-16). Also, row12 has 9's but no connection to prior. Unknown why 7's didn't merge—possibly wrong bbox pairing or alignment check.
 * Ex2 generated: Filled some vertical 1's and 7's (e.g., row6 col2/4/6/8/10/12/14 with 7's? But output shows partial), but missed horizontal extensions like 3 in row4 col6 (expected isolated but connected? Wait, expected has 3 in row4 col6 unchanged, but 5's connect horizontally in row2 col10-12, and 4's connect in row6 col6-8; generated leaves 5's separate at col10 and col12, no 4 merge in row6, and 7's/9's unconnected. Fills overdid some 1's or missed seq order [from legend row11: 2,3,4,6,5,7,9?].
 * Ex3 generated: Detected blocks but minimal fills—e.g., no merges in upper sections (expected connects 3's horizontally in row3 cols3-8, 2's in row3 cols11-15, 9's in row3 cols19-21; generated leaves all separate), lower 4's/6's in row9 cols14-18 unmerged (expected 4's span), and 6's in rows13-17 col11 isolated (expected vertical stack). Also, row20 7's unfilled. Seems to pop wrong blocks from queues, skipping alignments.
 * Overall: Block finding/sorting/legend extraction works (no errors there), but connect_two_blocks fails on non-aligned bboxes (e.g., partial row overlap not handled—fills only full bbox height/width, missing partial gaps) and queue popping assumes strict first-to-first, but seq may require matching closest/aligned blocks, not positional first. No chaining effects (e.g., after connecting A-B, B's new bbox isn't updated for B-C).
 * connect_two_blocks is helpful but broken for partial alignments (e.g., if rows overlap partially, no fill; needs extension to max(min_r, other_min_r) etc.).
 * program overall copies grid correctly and uses queues, but loop only does len(seq)-1 connections without re-finding blocks post-fill, so no iterative merging.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, but fill functions need enhancement for overlap.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills with 2's in many places (e.g., rows 1-5/8-13/15-21 have extensive 2 fills connecting across sections, like row3 col3-8/10-13/21-25, but this merges unrelated blocks and ignores sequence [likely from row26: 4,9,8,9,9,6,4,6,7,6,6,9,9,3,4,3,5,3,3,1,7,... non-1, but 8 is present? Wait, bg=1, legend non-1]. Expected should connect specific pairs like 2-to-4 in upper, but output fills entire rows with 2's, e.g., row16-20 all 2's in cols14-24, which looks like blob expansion rather than targeted gaps. Also, lower row22-25 has 2's filled into what should be isolated, and row27 legend unchanged but 1's overwritten? Misses vertical connections (e.g., 6's/7's in row10/27 unmerged) and creates uniform 2-regions that don't match puzzle's discrete shape extensions. This suggests wrong fill extents or ignoring alignments, making it incoherent for the sequence-based merging.

[2025-10-02 17:15:25] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs (3 examples), the following are **obvious, consistent interactions or connections** between elements. These are limited to properties that appear in **every** train example without variation or exception. Only elements with clear, direct effects or linkages are included (e.g., one property influencing the presence, position, color, or other attributes of another). Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., palette squares, which remain unchanged and isolated) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or rule inference is attempted; unknown aspects (e.g., exact conditions triggering a connection) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Inner Colored Squares (Small, holes=0) → Added Connection Shapes (Elongated, holes=0)**
   - **Description**: Positions of inner colored squares in the 3x3 grid consistently trigger the addition of new elongated shapes (likely line segments) in the output. These new shapes bridge gaps between adjacent inner squares (horizontally or vertically) within the same row or column.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox)**: Inner square positions determine exact placement of new shapes. New shapes occupy intermediate bbox coordinates between two inner squares (e.g., if inner at x=2-3 and x=15-16 in same row, new shape at x=11-13 or similar gap-filling position). Consistent in all 3 trains: ~70-80% of new shapes directly adjoin or span between 2+ existing inner positions.
     - **Size (pixels and bbox dimensions)**: Inner squares (pixels=1-4, compact bbox) lead to new shapes with increased pixels (2-6) and extended bbox (1-2 units longer in horizontal/vertical direction, e.g., from 1x1 to 3x1 or 1x3). No change to inner squares themselves.
     - **Color**: New shapes inherit color from at least one adjacent inner square (e.g., if connecting a Green inner to another, new shape is Green). Consistent match in every added shape across all trains.
   - **Consistency Note**: Appears in every output (7-9 new shapes per example). No new shapes added without nearby inners; all are grid-aligned.
   - **Unknown**: Exact trigger for which pairs of inners get connected (e.g., color match, adjacency type); some potential adjacencies lack connections.

#### 2. **Added Connection Shapes → Background (Large, multi-hole shape)**
   - **Description**: The addition of connection shapes consistently overlaps or covers portions of the background, altering its topology and area.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Hole Count (holes)**: Each new connection shape reduces the background's hole count (e.g., input holes=12-16 → output holes=7-9; reduction of 5-7 per example, scaling with number of connections). Consistent causal link: more connections = larger hole reduction.
     - **Area (pixels)**: Background pixels decrease proportionally to total pixels in new connection shapes (e.g., input ~180-570 → output ~175-558; net loss matches sum of connection pixels). Bbox unchanged.
     - **Color**: Background color (Maroon in all trains) unaffected.
   - **Consistency Note**: Universal in all 3 examples; hole/pixel changes directly correlate with connection additions (no other elements cause background changes).
   - **Unknown**: None for this interaction—direct overlap effect is clear.

#### 3. **Grid Frames (Medium, holes=1) ↔ Inner Colored Squares and Connections**
   - **Description**: Frames provide fixed boundaries that constrain and interact with inner squares and connections; all elements remain within frame bboxes.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox)**: Inner squares and new connections are always positioned inside frame bboxes (e.g., frames at [1,1,4,4], [7,1,10,4], etc.; inners/connections nested within). No spillover in any example.
     - **Color**: Frames (Blue in all trains) do not change color or gain new elements, but their blue-toned borders visually/maskingly interact with connections (some connections appear "blue-toned" in description, though data shows varied colors).
     - **Topology (holes)**: Frames' single hole (holes=1) remains unchanged, but encloses varying numbers of inner holes=0 elements; connections do not alter frame holes.
   - **Consistency Note**: Frames identical in input/output across all trains; all dynamic elements (inners + connections) depend on frame positions for alignment (3x3 grid structure preserved).
   - **Unknown**: Any direct effect from frames to connection creation (positions constrain but do not trigger).

#### Excluded Elements and Rationale
- **Palette Row (Bottom small squares, holes=0, pixels=1)**: No interactions; identical in every input/output, no position/color changes, no links to other elements. Irrelevant to transformations.
- **Test Inputs**: Not compared (no outputs provided); analysis limited to trains for consistency.
- **Inconsistent or Non-Interactive**: Background color variations (Maroon in trains, Blue/others in tests) not analyzed; single-pixel outliers or non-grid elements absent in trains.
- **No Forced Connections**: Semantic meanings (e.g., "pipes" or "circuits") not evident in data; hole counts in small shapes always 0 (no enclosures created). No position→color shifts beyond connections inheriting from inners.

[2025-10-02 17:16:27] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style polyomino puzzle on a grid, where 1s represent walls or barriers, 8s are background/empty space, and scattered numbers (2-9) in the grid and possibly a clue row at the bottom indicate the required size of connected polyomino regions (orthogonally adjacent cells of the same number must form exactly N cells for a clue N). The task is to resolve and fill ambiguous or partial regions by expanding/connecting same-number cells into complete polyominoes of the exact size, without overlapping walls or background, while leaving walls, background, and the clue row unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are bounded by 1s (walls) and 8s (background); fillings must stay within these enclosures and cannot cross them—treat 1s and 8s as impassable.
 * Each number N must form exactly one or more polyominoes of size exactly N; cells with the same N must connect orthogonally (up/down/left/right, no diagonals) to form these shapes, and no polyomino can be larger or smaller than N.
 * Partial clues (single N cells) need to be expanded by claiming adjacent empty cells (non-1, non-8) to reach size N; if multiple possible expansions, resolve based on fitting all clues without conflict (e.g., don't overclaim space needed for another number).
 * The bottom row (e.g., [8, 2, 8, 3, ...]) acts as a fixed clue legend or seed row—do not modify it; it provides initial N placements that must be expanded upward into the grid.
 * Subtle: Some regions may have multiple clues of the same N, requiring multiple separate polyominoes of size N; avoid merging different Ns or same N across walls. Empty regions without clues might remain 8s or need inference from fitting.
 * Overlapping possibilities: If a region has space for multiple polyominoes, prioritize exact fits; e.g., a clue 7 in a larger space might need to snake or L-shape to fill exactly 7 cells without leaving orphans.
 * Edge cases: Thin corridors (e.g., 1-cell wide) limit shapes; vertical/horizontal stretches must match sizes (e.g., a 2x2 block for 4, not a 1x4 line if it doesn't fit clues). Background 8s in regions might be "empty" but can be filled if needed for polyominoes.
 * All training examples show the bottom clue row unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming it's fixed. Grids vary in width (20, 20, 27 cols across examples), so handle variable dimensions.
 * No diagonals for connectivity; only 4-directional adjacency.
 * If a region has no clues, leave as 8s; if overconstrained (impossible fit), but assuming inputs are solvable.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single prior program used flood-fill on non-background/non-wall cells to identify components, then applied rules like filling with "minority color" if no 1s or filling non-1 cells with the other color if 1s present—but this misinterprets the puzzle as color-based merging rather than size-constrained polyomino expansion.
 * Worked: Correctly detected some connected components (e.g., in Train 1, it kept existing 2s,5s,7s in place without overwriting clues); identified walls (1s) and background (8s) accurately; preserved the bottom clue row unchanged.
 * Didn't work: Ignored polyomino size rules entirely—e.g., filled entire components with one number regardless of size (overfilling 7s as just two cells instead of expanding to seven); treated 1s as "walls to fill around" but didn't use them as boundaries for exact N-shapes; minority/majority logic led to arbitrary fills (e.g., Train 1 row 2 kept 7s as two cells, missing extension to [7,7,7,7,7,7? wait no, expected has three 7s in middle and three on right, but generated only two each).
 * Train 1 differences: Generated missed vertical extensions (e.g., rows 6-8 should have 2s in cols 2-3 and 6s in cols 16-17, but output has all 8s there); row 10 has 3s only in two cells but expected extends to six 3s (cols 1-6); row 14 all 8s/1s but expected has 9s in cols 8-9 and 2s in 16-17; unknown why it didn't expand from bottom clues upward.
 * Train 2 differences: Generated left many areas as 1s or unchanged, e.g., row 2 has 2 and 3 isolated but expected connects 2s across (cols 2 and 4); row 4 all 8s but expected has 3 in col 6; row 6 has 7 and 4 isolated but expected connects 4s (cols 6-8? wait, cols 6 and 8 for 4); row 5 has 3 in col 6 but generated empty; failed to expand bottom clues (e.g., 3,4,6 into vertical polyominoes).
 * Train 3 differences: Similar isolation issues—e.g., row 3 has 3,2,9 as singles but expected expands 3 to cols 3-6 (four 3s?), 2 to cols 11-15 (five 2s?), 9 unchanged? Wait, expected has 3s in 3-6 and 3s in 7-9? No, row 3 expected: 3 at col3, then 1s, but actually expands horizontally/vertically; generated missed most expansions (e.g., row 9 has 6 and 4 isolated, expected connects 6s? and 4s in cols 14-18); rows 13-17 all 8s/6? but generated empty, expected has vertical 6s in col11; bottom expansions ignored entirely.
 * extract_regions (from the program) is helpful for finding bounded areas but broken for polyomino logic—needs integration with clue sizes (don't use raw minority fill). No other functions in the attempt; color_count logic is unhelpful/irrelevant (puzzle isn't about colors, but numbers as sizes—discard it).
 * Overall: Attempt shows basic component detection but zero grasp of Fillomino rules (no size enforcement, no expansion from clues), leading to underfilled grids; bottom clues not propagated upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills large rectangular blocks without respecting polyomino sizes (e.g., rows 1-6 have a 5x6 block of 4s, which is 30 cells, but if seeded from a single 4 clue, it should be exactly 4 cells, not 30; similarly, 5-row 9s block is 25 cells, way over size 9). 
 * It treats entire row-spanning areas as single fills (e.g., cols 8-12 as 8s across multiple rows, but 8 is background—should not fill with 8 if claiming for polyominoes; expected likely has smaller, connected shapes like 4-cell 4s snaking around 1s). 
 * Bottom row clues (e.g., 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) are unchanged (good), but no upward expansion visible (e.g., col1 has 4 in bottom, but above it rows 15-20 have 9s/4s/5s/3s, not connected to bottom 4). 
 * Borders of 1s are preserved, but inner empties (implied 8s?) are wrongly uniform-filled, ignoring exact N sizes—e.g., a 5x5 block of 5s would be 25 cells, not size 5; this mismatches Fillomino, where shapes must be exactly N connected cells per clue. 
 * Unknown why it filled with 8s in some blocks (e.g., cols 8-12), as 8 is background—perhaps mistaking empty regions, but expected should fill with numbers from nearby clues or leave empty only if no fit. Overall, it looks like crude region painting, not size-aware polyominoes; to fix, start from each clue position and grow exactly N cells using BFS/possible shapes, resolving conflicts by backtracking or deduction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a 2D array of integers representing colors or fills (1 likely as background/white, 2+ as colored regions, 8 as unknowns/blanks to be resolved, and other numbers like 3-9 as special markers or obstacles). The goal is to transform the grid by applying rules to fill or adjust 8's and possibly other elements based on patterns like bounded regions or connections, ensuring consistency across rows and potentially columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 8's should be filled only if they form internal sequences bounded by the same non-8 color (e.g., >1) on both sides within a row, treating them as part of an extending colored region; however, boundaries must handle edges carefully to avoid assuming a default color like 0.
 * Index bounds are critical: when scanning for left/right non-8 bounds around 8-sequences, the code must prevent out-of-range access (e.g., l < 0 or r >= n), which caused crashes; use safe checks like if l >= 0 before accessing row[l].
 * The puzzle likely involves row-wise processing first, but may require column-wise or global consistency checks, as the grid shows symmetric or repeating patterns (e.g., 2-regions with embedded numbers like 4,6,9 that might act as "seeds" or fixed points not to overwrite).
 * Subtle elements: Embedded numbers (3-9) in colored regions (e.g., 2's) should remain unchanged unless rules specify merging; all-1 rows suggest background filling, but over-filling (e.g., turning everything to 1) ignores colored blobs. 8's might only fill if bounds are strictly same and non-background (not 1). Training errors indicate the need for robust edge cases, like 8's at row starts/ends or isolated 8's.
 * Global considerations: The grid has vertical symmetry and repeating 2-blob structures with varying embedded numbers (e.g., row 3 has 4 and 9 in 2's, row 10 has 6,7,4,9); rules might propagate fills vertically or match patterns across the grid. Deepcopy is useful to avoid mutating input, but ensure the function returns a modified copy.
 * Potential misses: Not handling cases where 8's are adjacent to 1's (background) without a matching bound; ignoring vertical influences (e.g., 8 in row 4 might align with patterns above/below); assuming left_c/right_c >1 without verifying they are actual colors (1 might be invalid for filling).

                    row[k] = left_c
        g[r] = row
    return g
```
(Note: This function is conceptually helpful for row-wise 8-filling but is currently broken due to potential index errors in bound finding; it could be fixed with better sentinels or conditional access. No other types/tools from attempts, as this is the primary one.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on filling internal 8-sequences in rows bounded by matching colors >1, which aligns with a core rule for resolving blanks in colored regions.
 * What worked: Successfully deepcopy'd the grid to avoid mutation; generated a partial output for the test input without crashing it (unlike training); correctly skipped non-8 cells and identified sequences.
 * What didn't work: Caused "list assignment index out of range" errors in all three training examples, likely due to unsafe access when l < 0 or r >= n during bound finding (e.g., row[l] or row[r] without checks); in test, it failed to fill the 8 in row 4 (position 3: [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]) because left bound (1) != right bound (1? but interrupted by 9), leaving 8 unchanged and not propagating any fills; over-filled some rows to all 1's? Wait, no—the output shows mostly unchanged rows with 8 intact, suggesting the filling condition never triggered properly.
 * The program function simply wraps the fill_eights, which is minimal but doesn't address vertical or multi-pass rules, missing broader puzzle elements like connecting 2-blobs vertically.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., blobs or regions) was attempted, which might be essential for identifying bounded areas globally; this attempt assumes purely row-local rules, ignoring potential column interactions.
 * Training mismatches: All errored out, so no validation; unknown why index errors occurred (possibly training grids have 8's at edges without sentinels), but it demonstrates lack of robustness.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It largely mirrors the input grid (assuming standard input has similar structure), with the 8 in row 4 (0-indexed) remaining unfilled (output shows [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]), and embedded numbers like 9,4,7 unchanged, but no evident filling of 8's despite the rule intent—suggesting the bounding condition failed (left of 8 is 1, right is 1 but with 9 nearby, possibly not matching strictly).
 * Many rows are output as repeating 1's or partial 2-blobs (e.g., row 1: [1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,...] unchanged), which might be correct if no 8's to fill, but the all-1 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,7) look like background preservation; however, later rows like 15-19 show 2-blobs with embedded 9,4,5,3 which remain, indicating no overwriting happened.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should resolve the 8 to match surrounding pattern (e.g., fill to 1 or extend a color, but based on rules, possibly to 4 if bounded by 4's—though here bounds are 1's); instead, 8 persists, and no vertical consistency (e.g., row 27 mirrors row 4 with 8 and 9's unfilled). This doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as 8's are unresolved blanks; it seems like the code ran but skipped filling due to mismatched bounds or bugs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a Fillomino-style logic puzzle where a grid (with 8s representing empty/unfilled cells, 1s likely acting as boundaries, dividers, or pre-filled non-polyomino cells, and scattered numbers 2-9 as given clues in the bottom row) must be filled such that groups of identical numbers form orthogonally connected polyominoes exactly matching the number's value (e.g., three 3's connected together). The program attempts to automate filling by propagating numbers horizontally into sequences of 8s based on nearby clues or bounds, but it ignores vertical connections, full polyomino validation, and multi-step deduction.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Polyominoes must be exactly the size of the number (e.g., a 5 requires exactly five connected 5's; no more, no less), and same-number polyominoes cannot touch orthogonally even if separate groups.
 * 8s are empty cells to be filled; 1s appear to serve as fixed boundaries or walls that cannot be part of polyominoes (they block horizontal/vertical propagation and remain 1s in outputs).
 * Clues (2-9) are given primarily in the bottom row, separated by 8s, but fillings can extend vertically into upper rows; horizontal-only filling misses cases where polyominoes span rows (e.g., vertical stacks like three 2's in rows 5-7 of train1 expected output).
 * Deduction often requires looking beyond immediate bounds: if a sequence of 8s is bounded by 1s, the fill number comes from the nearest clue (left or right), but only if the sequence length matches or can connect to form the exact polyomino size; over-filling (e.g., assigning a number to a sequence longer/shorter than needed) breaks the rule.
 * Subtle: Some regions remain 8s if they are not part of any clue-based polyomino (e.g., isolated 8s between groups in train1 row2 positions 5-6 stay 8, not filled with 5). Propagation must consider both directions and avoid assuming all 8-sequences are fillable—some are "gaps" between polyominoes.
 * The bottom row (clues) is untouchable (skipped in processing), and the puzzle assumes orthogonal (up/down/left/right) connectivity only—no diagonals.
 * Edge cases: Single-cell clues (rare, but if length=1 bounded by 1s, it may copy the nearest clue directly); long 1-sequences may indicate separate regions; vertical priority over horizontal in conflicts (e.g., train1 rows 5-7 fill vertically with 2's and 6's despite horizontal 8s).
 * All attempts fail to validate polyomino sizes post-filling (e.g., no check if a filled group actually connects to exactly N cells), leading to overfills or wrong numbers.
 * Grids vary in size (20x20 for train1/2, 27x27 for train3), so dimension handling is key, but processing only upper rows (skipping bottom) is correct but insufficient without vertical logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
```
(This is a simple, correct utility for getting grid height/width; useful for iteration bounds.)

The main `program` function is an attempt at filling logic but is broken overall (see below); it correctly identifies horizontal 8-sequences but fails on number selection and vertical integration. No other helper functions are provided, but a potential useful addition could be a function to find nearest clue horizontally/vertically:
```python
def find_nearest_clue(g: List[List[int]], row: int, col: int, direction: str) -> int:
    # Example stub: search left/right/up/down from (row, col) for first 2-9, skipping 1s and 8s
    # Return 0 if none found
    pass
```
(This is conceptual; not in the attempt but would help for better propagation than the attempt's buggy left/right search.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and skips the bottom clue row, uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, and properly detects horizontal sequences of 8s bounded by non-8s (e.g., correctly fills the two 2's in train1 row2/3 bounded by 1s, matching expected).
 * It works for simple cases where a horizontal 8-sequence is directly bounded by matching clues >1 (e.g., partial matches in train1 for 7's in row2/3), and sometimes picks the right number from left/right when bounded by 1s (e.g., 3's in train9/10).
 * However, it fails to handle vertical propagation entirely—no code for checking/connecting across rows, leading to misses like the vertical 2's and 6's in train1 rows5-7 (generated keeps 8s, expected fills them) and vertical 6's in train3 rows13-17 (generated all 8s, expected 6's in col11).
 * Bug in bound detection: The left/right bound finding loops incorrectly extend bounds if adjacent 8s (e.g., in train1 row2, it over-extends left/right for the 5-clue area, filling positions 5-6 with 5's where expected 8,8 as a gap).
 * Flawed 1-bounded logic: When bounded by 1s, it prefers left clue but only if left 1-sequence length==1, else right— this is arbitrary and wrong (e.g., in train1 row9, it picks 9 for a sequence that should be 3 from left, and fills 6's correctly but in wrong spot; in train2 row2, it leaves 3's as 1's instead of filling adjacent 8? Wait, input unclear but generated has 1,2,1,2 instead of expected 1,2,1,2 but misses later 3/8).
 * In train3, it fills upper horizontal groups (e.g., 3's and 2's in row3) but completely ignores lower vertical stacks (e.g., expected 6's in rows13-17 col11 stay 8s; expected 4's in row9 col14-16 become wrong 6,1,1 or similar—mismatch in positioning).
 * Over-filling issue: Fills sequences longer than the clue (e.g., train1 row9 fills four 9's? but clue is 9, yet expected uses 3's instead, suggesting vertical or size mismatch not checked).
 * The while-loop for sequence detection skips non-8 cells correctly but doesn't revisit after filling (no iterative propagation), so partial fills don't trigger further changes (e.g., train2 misses filling after initial 8's to 3/4).
 * Function `program` is partially helpful for horizontal detection but broken for full solving (don't reuse without vertical logic and validation); the inner left/right clue search is unhelpful/buggy as it skips 1s but doesn't search vertically or validate size.
 * All training examples incorrect: Train1 mismatches in filled gaps (e.g., extra 5's/9's where 8's/3's expected) and misses verticals; Train2 mismatches in partial horizontals (e.g., generated 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,3 but expected 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,8 and vertical 3/4/6/7/9 in row4/6); Train3 mismatches in verticals (e.g., no 6's or 4's in lower rows) and some horizontals (e.g., row9 has 6,1,1,6,6,6 but expected 6,1,1,4,4,4).
 * Unknown reasons for some mismatches (e.g., why train1 row10 fills 8,8,8 with 6's correctly but row9 overfills 9's—possibly bound detection error in while l >=0 and g[i][l]==8).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-fills nearly the entire grid with groups of five 2's (e.g., rows2-6 have long horizontal 2,2,2,2,2 sequences bounded by 1s), but this ignores clue sizes in the bottom row (e.g., clues like 4,9,4,7,6,9 require exact polyominoes of those sizes, not all 2's; a group of five 2's would need to be part of ten 2's total for validity, but no such connection exists).
 * It treats borders as all 1s (e.g., row0 all 1s, many rows starting/ending with 1s), suggesting the input had 8s replaced indiscriminately, but expected should leave gaps as 1s or 8s and form vertical/horizontal polyominoes matching bottom clues (e.g., a 9-clue should have nine connected 9's spanning rows, not scattered 2's or 9's in single positions like row3 col22).
 * Wrong numbers in key spots: e.g., row17 has 2,2,9,2,2 but a 9 should connect to eight more 9's (not isolated); row18 has scattered higher numbers (9,4,2,2,5,2,2,3,2,2) that don't form valid polyominoes (e.g., single 9 can't be valid). This indicates the horizontal-only logic failed on a larger/wider grid (29 cols?), creating artificial 1-boundaries and ignoring vertical needs.
 * To handle test, must add vertical search/propagation and size validation (e.g., after filling a group, count connected same-number cells == number value).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style logic puzzle on a grid with walls (cells marked 1, which block regions), clue cells (numbers 2-9 indicating the exact size of the connected region that cell belongs to), and empty cells (marked 8, to be filled with numbers 2-9 such that all connected cells sharing the same number form a polyomino of exactly that size, without crossing walls or clues mismatched to their regions). The goal is to deduce and fill all 8s logically based on clues and constraints, ensuring no region violates size rules, clues are satisfied, and the grid is fully resolved without isolated cells or overflows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (1s) act as barriers; regions cannot connect across or include 1s, and 1s themselves are not part of any numbered region.
 * Clues (2-9) must be the starting point for a region of exactly that many connected cells ( orthogonally adjacent, no diagonals), all filled with the same number as the clue; no two different clues can be in the same region unless they match in value and size constraints.
 * Empty cells (8s) must be filled to extend regions logically; single-cell regions are impossible since clues start at 2, so all 8s must connect to existing clues or form new regions only if deducible (but typically all connect back to clues).
 * Horizontal and vertical fillings must consider adjacent clues and skipped walls (1s between sequences of 8s), but cannot assume fills without verifying total region size; over-filling (e.g., long chains of the same number exceeding the clue value) violates rules.
 * Special cases for all-8 rows: These may need targeted filling based on bottom clues (e.g., if a specific clue like bottom[13]==9 triggers patterns), but must avoid assuming offsets without bounds checking; even/odd indexing for offsets risks skipping or duplicating fills.
 * Subtle deduction rules: When 8s are bounded by clues on left/right (or up/down), fill with the matching clue if sizes align (e.g., equal clues with no/minimal skipped 1s); if unequal, prefer the closer/bounding clue or use length of 8s sequence to decide (e.g., short sequences like length=1 or 2 favor smaller/nearer clues, but only if total region won't exceed); symmetric cases (equal skipped 1s) require checking sequence length against clue (e.g., length=3 with 1 skipped might take max/min based on puzzle norms).
 * Avoid naive fills: Do not fill entire sequences of 8s with a single number without counting total connected cells (including vertical/horizontal extensions); this can create oversized regions (e.g., five 2s in a row is invalid for size 2).
 * Grid structure: Clues often in bottom/top rows separated by 1s; upper grid has blocks of 1s (solid walls) and open areas with 8s; fills must propagate across rows/columns without leaving isolated 8s.
 * Edge cases: Zero skipped 1s allows direct propagation from one side; multiple skipped 1s (e.g., 1 or 2) may block or weight toward one clue; clues like 9 may indicate large regions spanning multiple rows.
 * Full resolution: Program must iterate fills (horizontal then vertical, possibly multiple passes) until no 8s remain; partial fills (leftover 8s) indicate incomplete logic.
 * No diagonals or wrapping; regions are strictly orthogonal polyominoes.

```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `fill_all8_rows`: Broken due to index out of range errors (e.g., accessing offset_cols[ii-1] when ii exceeds len(offset_cols), or assuming fixed indices like g[h-2][13]==9 without grid validation); overly specific to unconfirmed patterns (e.g., even/odd ii for offsets +3 from clues); does not generally help deduce regions and causes crashes—remove or heavily refactor.
 * No region size validation function: All attempts lack a post-fill check to ensure no region exceeds its number (critical flaw); without this, fills are speculative and invalid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (no prior ones detailed) focused on horizontal/vertical filling of 8 sequences bounded by clues, with heuristics for unequal clues (prefer nearer/bounding, adjust by skipped 1s and sequence length) and special all-8 row handling, but failed entirely on training examples due to index errors in `fill_all8_rows` (out of range on offset_cols and fixed [13] access, likely from assuming clue positions without bounds checks).
 * What worked: For the test input, it successfully ran without error and filled many 8s into 2s (e.g., horizontal stretches of five 2s in multiple rows, like rows 1-5 and 8-11), and placed some higher numbers (e.g., 4 at [3][3], 9 at [3][22], 6 at [10][3], 7 at [10][10], 4 at [10][22], 9 at [11][22], 2s extended in lower sections like rows 15-20 with added 9/4/5/3 placements); this shows basic detection of 8 sequences and clue propagation for small/default fills (2s as fallback?).
 * What didn't work: Training examples 1-3 all crashed with "list assignment index out of range" (likely in `fill_all8_rows` when computing/iterating offset_cols or accessing g[h-2][13] on smaller/variable grids); no training passes, indicating non-robust code. For test, filling is incomplete (e.g., row 27 still has an 8 at position 3), and logic is flawed—long horizontal 2-runs (e.g., five connected 2s in row 1 cols 1-5) create invalid regions (size 5 > 2, violating Fillomino rules); vertical connections (e.g., stacked 2s across rows 1-5 in col 1) would compound to even larger invalid regions. Heuristics for fill_n (e.g., taking max/min for length=3 with skipped=1, or preferring left if skipped_left < skipped_right) are ad-hoc and over-aggressive, ignoring total region size; symmetric cases (equal clues/skipped) have inconsistent rules (e.g., min vs max in vertical vs horizontal). No iteration for propagating fills across directions, leaving deductions partial. `fill_all8_rows` contributed nothing useful here (no all-8 rows filled specially, and it may have skipped due to conditions like g[h-2][13]==9 not met).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates partial grasp of bounding clues and sequence filling but misses core region validation, leading to invalid outputs; errors prevent any training success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially filled the grid (e.g., upper blocks like rows 1-6 and 8-13 have patterns of 1s separating stretches of five 2s, with isolated higher numbers like 4/9/6/7 inserted; lower sections rows 15-20 mirror this with 2s and 5/3/9/4; solid 1-rows at 0,6-7,13-14,20-21,25-26,28 act as barriers) but does not look correct overall.
 * Issues: Many 2-fills create oversized regions (e.g., row 1: 2s at cols 1-5 connect horizontally to size 5 >2; vertically, col 1 has 2s in rows 1-5,8-11,15-20 stacking to size 15+ >2, invalid); this suggests the program defaulted to 2s for unknown/bounded 8s without size checks. Higher placements (e.g., 9 at row 3 col 22, 5 at row 17 col 16) might align with nearby clues (bottom row has 9s/5s), but without full connectivity check, they could be wrong (e.g., if the 9-region doesn't reach size 9). Incomplete: Row 27 retains an 8 (at col 3, between 4 and 1,9 clues), meaning deduction failed there—likely needs vertical propagation from above or better bounding logic. Expected output should have no 8s left, all regions exactly matching their number (e.g., 2s only in isolated domino pairs, 9s in nonominoes connecting to clue positions), and no overflows; this output violates that by over-filling 2s and leaving gaps, so it mismatches a correct resolution (difference likely due to lack of region counting and multi-pass deduction).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a region-filling puzzle on a grid where 1's serve as impassable boundaries (walls), 8's are empty cells to be filled, and clue numbers (2-9) are seeds placed within regions; the goal is to identify each connected region (4-way adjacent non-1 cells) bounded by 1's or grid edges, and fill all 8's in that region with the single clue number (2-9) present in it, leaving single-cell regions (like bottom-row clues separated by 8's) unchanged except for their clue.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) groups of 8's and exactly one clue per region; filling must propagate the clue to all connected 8's within the boundaries, even for non-rectangular or L-shaped regions spanning multiple rows/columns.
 * 1's block propagation entirely and are never changed; 8's on the grid edges or outside regions may remain 8's if not part of a fillable region.
 * Bottom row typically contains isolated single-cell regions with clues (2-9) separated by 8's, which stay as-is (clue in place, adjacent 8's unfilled since they may be boundaries or separate).
 * Assume exactly one clue (2-9) per region; no overwriting of existing clues or handling multiple clues per region (puzzle validity assumes this).
 * Propagation must handle vertical, horizontal, and turning connections (e.g., a clue in one row filling adjacent columns in another row); straight-line run filling alone misses complex shapes.
 * Iterative passes (horiz then vert) can approximate propagation but fail if not checking connectivity fully, as runs may not align with region bounds (e.g., bounded by 1's instead of matching clues).
 * Unfilled 8's in generated outputs often indicate missed vertical propagation or regions bounded by 1's (not same >1 clues).
 * Clues like 2-9 in bottom row do not propagate upward unless connected through a region (rarely, as they are isolated).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 20x20 in ex1-2, 27x27? in ex3), with borders often all-8 rows/columns that remain 8's.
 * Subtle: Some regions span multiple rows but are vertically bounded by 1's (e.g., rows 2-3 only), so no spillover to adjacent all-8 rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The previous attempt's `get_dimensions` is useful for getting grid size. No other functions from the attempt are helpful, as the core logic (run-based filling) is flawed for regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt used iterative (20 passes) horizontal and vertical run-filling: finds consecutive 8's in a row/column, extends to find bounding cells, and fills the run only if bounds are identical numbers >1; this worked partially for straight horizontal runs adjacent to clues >1 (e.g., ex1 row2 cols2-3 filled as 2,2; cols8-9 as 5,5; cols15-16 as 7,7; ex2 row2 col2=2 single; ex3 row3 col3=3 single, col11=2 single).
 * Failed completely for regions bounded by 1's (not >1 clues), leaving runs of 8's unfilled (e.g., ex1 row2 cols11-13 stayed 8,8,8 instead of 7,7,7 from a nearby 7 clue in the same row-bounded region; ex3 row3 cols6-8 stayed 1,1,1? but expected 3,3,3 from horizontal propagation within 1-bounded region).
 * Missed all vertical propagation into all-8 areas adjacent to filled rows (e.g., ex1 rows5-7 cols2-3 stayed 8's instead of 2,2; rows5-7 cols15-16 stayed 8's instead of 6,6; ex2 row4 col2 stayed 8 instead of 3; row6 col4-5 stayed 1,4,1? but expected 4,4 from vertical; ex3 rows13-17 col11 stayed 8's? but expected 6's vertically).
 * Did not handle region connectivity across turns/corners (e.g., ex1 row9 cols5-6=3,3 filled horizontally, but if vertically connected, would miss; ex3 row9 cols16-18=4,4,4 expected but gen missed vertical from row10? gen row10 has 1,1,6,1,1 but no full fill).
 * Bottom row clues stayed correctly unfilled around them (e.g., all examples kept isolated 2-9 with surrounding 8's as 8's), as bounds were 8's or edges (condition left_c == right_c >1 not met).
 * Worked for some isolated singles (e.g., ex2 row2 col6=3; ex3 row3 col20=9), but over-relied on bounds matching clues, ignoring 1-bounded regions.
 * Function `fill_horizontal` and `fill_vertical` are broken for this puzzle: they only fill straight runs bounded by matching >1 clues, useless for 1-bounded or multi-direction regions (do not use in future; replace with flood fill).
 * `program` iteration helped propagate some chained horizontal fills but stalled on vertical or bounded cases (e.g., ex1 filled initial 2's/5's/7's but no further).
 * Ex1: Generated mismatched 7's (cols11-13 row2-3=8's vs expected 7's; cols13 row2=8 vs 7; vertical 2's/6's in rows5-7=8's vs expected filled; row9 cols5-6=3,3 correct but row10 cols5-6=3,3 correct? wait gen row10=1,3,3,1 correct; row13 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 9,9?; row14 cols15-16=2,2 correct but reason unknown).
 * Ex2: Mismatched vertical fills (row4 col2=8 vs 3; row4 col10=8 vs 6; row4 col14=8 vs 7; row6 cols4-5=1,4,1? gen 1,4,1 but expected 4,4 vertical from row6 col4=4 seed?; row2 col4=8 vs 2).
 * Ex3: Mismatched horizontal extensions in 1-bounded regions (row3 cols3=3 single vs extended 3's at cols6-8; row9 cols16-18=1,1,1? vs 4,4,4; vertical 6's in rows13-17 col11=8's vs expected 6's; row6 col20=8 vs 9; row18-22 cols20-22=8's vs 7?).
 * `deepcopy` is helpful to avoid mutating input but irrelevant to core logic failure.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrated partial understanding of line-filling but zero grasp of full region flood fill, leading to all training failures; no extraction functions present, but one could be added for regions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows excessive horizontal filling with 2's in long runs bounded by 1's (e.g., row1 cols1-5=2's, row3 cols1-3=2's and cols5-6=2's around a 4 seed without overwriting or unifying the region, row10 cols1-5=2's, row16 cols1-5=2's and cols14-18=2's around 2's but with 5 at col16, row18 cols1-3=2's around 9/4 but kept separate), which suggests the run-filling logic applied blindly without checking region clues or vertical connections.
 * It preserves seeds like 4 (row3 col3), 9 (row3 col22), 6 (row10 col3), 7 (row10 col11), but fills adjacent 8's with 2's incorrectly if those seeds define different regions (e.g., row3 has 4 and 9 isolated but surrounded by 2-fills, implying wrong clue propagation; likely the 2's come from nearby seeds, but verticals like row16-17 cols14-18=2's may miss extensions from row18's 3/5/etc.).
 * Bottom row (row27?) has [1,4,1,8,1,9,...] with 1's as bounds? but fills none around singles, which is partially correct for isolation but wrong if any vertical regions exist above; overall, it looks like partial horizontal fills without full region awareness, leaving potential vertical/mixed connections (e.g., row8 all 1's? vs possible bounds, row15 all 1's) unfilled or mismatched—does not match puzzle rules, as regions with clues like 3/5/7 in row18 should fill connected 8's above/beside, not default to 2's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify background, detect framed blocks containing inner colored regions, extract a sequence of colors from a key row at the bottom, match inners to that sequence, and connect consecutive matched inners with paths of their color—horizontally within blocks and vertically between blocks, including shifting rows for multi-connection gaps. The output is the modified grid with these connections filled in, preserving the original structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the entire grid; all other colors represent objects, frames, or keys.
 * Blocks are vertical stacks of at least 2 consecutive non-background rows; they represent framed regions, and frames are detected as the dominant non-background color in uniform rows within a block (fallback to most frequent non-bg).
 * Inner regions are contiguous horizontal runs of the same non-background, non-frame color within blocks; these are merged vertically if they align in x-range and color, forming rectangular inners.
 * The key row is the bottommost row (scanning downward) with 3-12 isolated runs of non-background cells (total non-bg <=15), treated as single-cell colors in left-to-right order to form the sequence.
 * Inners are assigned to the sequence by matching colors, preferring leftmost unused inner for duplicates.
 * Connections: Horizontal gaps between same-block inners are filled directly if adjacent in x; vertical connections between different blocks use overlapping x-ranges in the gap rows between blocks, but for height-2 gaps with multiple connections, shift the lower block up by 1 row, fill the new single gap row with all connections (overlapping fills), and update positions.
 * Subtleties: Vertical plans only fill if x-overlap exists and gap rows are available; after shifts, remaining verticals are filled straightforwardly. Assume singles in key row (skip one after each non-bg). Fallback key row is h-2 if no match. No diagonal or non-rectangular fills. Preserve bg in fills only if empty.
 * Edge cases: No inners or short sequence skips output. Blocks sorted by y_start. Global updates for shifts affect blocks, key_row, and lower plans. Height-2 multi-conn shifts only bottom-to-top processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) implements a full pipeline for detecting bg, blocks, frames, inners, key row/sequence, assignment, and connections (horizontal direct, vertical with height-2 shift for multiples), but fails entirely due to a Python syntax error: "global key_row" is declared after key_row is used (in the shift logic), causing execution errors in all training examples and test.
 * What worked: Core detection functions (bg, blocks, inners, key row, sequence, assignment) appear logically sound based on puzzle rules; horizontal fills and basic vertical fills would likely work if executed; shift logic attempts to handle multi-connections in tight gaps by inserting space via row shift.
 * What didn't work: The global declaration bug crashes everything before any output; no actual grid modifications occur, so all results are errors instead of grids. Key row update in shifts uses global but is post-use. Assumes single-cell key entries (j +=1 after append), which may miss multi-cell keys. Vertical x-overlap is max(start)-min(end), which could be empty if no overlap. No handling for same-color inners in different blocks without vertical gaps. Fallback frame detection may pick inners as frame if no uniform rows.
 * The main program structure is helpful for future but needs bug fixes; inner extraction via temp_inners and grouping is essential for merging rectangles.
 * No prior attempts, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of sequencing and connections but zero execution success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error, not a grid, so it does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution; expected is a modified grid with connections filled, but nothing generates due to the crash.
 * Specifically, the error prevents any observation of whether detections (e.g., inners, sequence) or fills (e.g., horizontals, verticals with shifts) work for the test input; without running, we can't confirm if the logic would produce correct paths (e.g., if test has height-2 multi-conns needing shift, or non-overlapping verticals to skip).
 * The error output is identical across all examples, indicating the bug is universal and blocks all progress; test likely needs the shift logic (if multi-conns present) or basic verticals, but we can't verify differences from expected without fixed execution—assume incorrect until fixed and outputs grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (often 8 or 1) and colored components that form incomplete frames or outlines enclosing small inner regions; the goal is to fill gaps between adjacent or overlapping frames with a specific color chosen based on isolated color markers at the bottom of the grid, effectively completing symmetric or connected shapes while preserving the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is typically the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training examples 1-3, 1 in the test); all fills must only overwrite bg cells, never existing colors.
 * Bottom isolates are single non-bg cells in the bottom row (or near-bottom) flanked by bg on both sides; there must be at least 3 such isolates in a row to be valid, and their positions (indexed from 1) and colors guide color selection for fills via adjacency rules (e.g., choose the color whose position is minimal in adjacent pairs).
 * Frames are medium-sized connected components (5-50 cells) of a single color (frame_color, chosen as the color with the most such components); these enclose 1-8 cell inner regions of a different color, which must be identified within the frame's bounding box.
 * Fills occur between pairs of frames that overlap in one dimension (rows for horizontal pairs, columns for vertical) with a small gap (1-3 bg cells); the fill color is selected from the two inner colors based on bottom isolate adjacency, and fills only the gap rows/columns using the union or range from the inners.
 * Subtlety: Horizontal pairs fill specific rows from the union of inner colored rows; vertical pairs fill specific columns from the chosen inner's range; gaps must be exactly between frames without full overlap or large separations.
 * Overlapping frames must share the overlap dimension but have a gap in the other; inners must be exactly one per frame and small (1-8 cells) to qualify.
 * Easy to miss: Frame_color selection prioritizes medium components but may fail if multiple colors qualify; bottom isolates are only considered if >=3 in a single row; fills don't extend beyond the gap or overwrite non-bg; the bottom row itself has scattered single-color isolates (1-9) that aren't filled but guide the logic.
 * Components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right); visited tracking prevents revisiting in inner extraction.
 * Puzzle assumes a single frame_color; if none found, return unchanged grid.
 * Test input has wider grid (29 cols) and more complex nesting; bg=1, main fill color seems 2 with outliers (3-9); fills must respect multiple levels of frames.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies bg (e.g., 8 or 1) and frame_color via medium component count, and extracts bottom isolates only if >=3 in a row, which works for qualifying valid rows in all training examples.
 * find_components and identify_outers are helpful and correctly find frames/inners (e.g., detects small inners like the 7's in train1 row2-3, 2's in train2 row2-3), but pairing logic in get_pairs fails to detect all overlaps/gaps (e.g., misses horizontal overlap for 7's in train1 rows2-4 cols11-17, where gap=0 but should fill via adjacency).
 * What worked: Some vertical fills partially succeed, like extending 3's and 4's in train1 rows9-11/14-16, but incompletely (e.g., train1 row10 col5-6 filled as 3 but expected full extension); bottom isolate adjacency selection works for simple cases but ignores non-adjacent colors.
 * What didn't: No fills applied in many gap areas, leaving bg (8 or 1) where expected colors propagate (e.g., train1: rows2-4 cols11-13/15-17 remain 8 instead of 7; rows5-7 cols2-3/16-17 remain 8 instead of 2/6; row10 cols1-5/7 remain 8 instead of 3; row13 cols8-9 remain 8 instead of 9; row15 cols11-14 remain 8 instead of 4).
 * Train1 differences: Generated misses horizontal fills for 2 (rows5-7 cols2-3), 6 (rows5-7 cols16-17), 9 (row13 cols8-9), and partial 3/4 extensions; also no vertical fill for 7's across cols11-17 in rows2-4; bottom row unchanged correctly, but isolates not fully guiding all pairs.
 * Train2 differences: Generated misses fills like 2 in row2 col4/row3 col2 (expected 2 extensions); 3 in row4 col6/row6 col2? Wait, row4 is all bg except isolates, but expected 3 at row4 col6; row6 col4-5 as 4 but generated bg; row7 col4 as 4 but generated 1? No, generated has some 4/6 but misses 5 extensions in row7 col10-11? Unknown why partial—perhaps overlap check fails for vertical pairs.
 * Train3 differences: Generated has almost no fills beyond existing (e.g., misses 2 extensions in row3 cols11-15 to 2; 4 in row9 cols14-16/20-21? row10 col19-21 as 4 but generated bg; vertical 6 in rows12-16 col11 as 6 but generated bg; 9 in row6 col19 as 9 but generated bg; row18-22 almost unchanged, missing 8? fills); wider grid causes bbox issues, with inners not paired due to gap>3 or no overlap.
 * get_pairs is broken for vertical fills (e.g., fill_cols from chosen_o only, but should union or extend; overlap_check uses wrong indices for vertical); apply_fills only fills if bg but doesn't handle multi-row/col properly.
 * find_bottom_isolates is helpful but too strict (only one row checked, misses multi-row bottoms in test); get_all_pos correctly maps colors to positions but assumes single row.
 * Overall, attempt understands frame/inner extraction and bottom-guided color choice but fails on pair detection (gaps/overlaps) and fill application (wrong ranges/union), leading to under-filling; no over-filling observed.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it primarily fills large areas with 2 (e.g., rows1-6/8-13/15-? cols1-6/8-13/21-25 as 2, matching some inner 2's) but leaves many bg=1 cells unfilled where extensions are needed (e.g., row3 col6-7/13-? should extend 4/8/9 but remain 1; row10 col3-6/21-24 should extend 6/4 but partial/missing; row17-20 cols14-20/22-25 have some 2 but miss 5/3 extensions like row18 col17 as 5→full row? ; bottom row22-26 have 3/7 but no upward fills to connect).
 * It over-fills some 2 areas beyond frames (e.g., row15-16 cols14-20 as 2, but input has no inner there—perhaps false pair); ignores isolates like 8/9/4/7/6/9/4/5/3/7, only using adjacent for partial 2/4 fills, missing vertical propagations (e.g., no 6 fill in col11 rows8-14).
 * Makes sense for simple horizontal 2 fills but not for complex vertical/nested (e.g., row18 has 9/4/5/3 but no fills above); likely pairing misses small gaps or wrong overlap, leaving ~70% of expected fills undone; to handle test, need better multi-row bottom scan and union fills for vertical pairs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains colored blocks (numbers 1-9 representing colors) separated by background (bg, often 8 or 1), with a legend sequence in the second-to-last row indicating an order to connect consecutive colored blocks by filling straight-line gaps (horizontal or vertical) between them using the color of the starting block in each pair, effectively merging or extending blocks to form paths or shapes matching the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend sequence is extracted from non-bg cells in the second-to-last row (n-2), representing the order of colors to connect (e.g., connect first available block of color A to first of B, then B to C, etc.).
 * Connections only fill background gaps in straight horizontal or vertical lines between bounding boxes of consecutive blocks if they align on the same row(s) or column(s); no diagonal or complex path filling.
 * Multiple blocks per color exist (e.g., several disconnected 2's), so they must be processed in positional order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting by min_r then min_c) using a queue to select the "next" available block for connection.
 * Fill only bg cells; do not overwrite existing non-bg cells, and fills should merge blocks without expanding beyond the gap between bboxes.
 * Background is always the top-left cell's value (e.g., 8 in training, 1 in test); legend skips bg in extraction.
 * Subtle: Connections may chain across the sequence, so popping/using blocks in order can leave later blocks unconnected if wrong pairs are chosen; some expected outputs show horizontal fills spanning multiple columns (e.g., 7's connecting across in ex1 row 2-3) or vertical extensions.
 * Easy to miss: Not all blocks of a color are connected in every step—only consecutive in sequence; leftover blocks remain unchanged. Also, bboxes must be precise (min/max r/c of connected components via flood-fill/DFS/stack).
 * Grids have frame-like 1's in some cases (e.g., outlining shapes), which should not be filled into unless part of a connection.
 * In test case, bg=1 acts as both frame and separator, so fills must distinguish carefully to avoid merging unintended areas.
 * Sequence length is len(legend)-1 connections; process sequentially without revisiting.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills entire row/col spans between bboxes, but if bboxes don't perfectly align (e.g., partial overlap), it may fill extra or miss (e.g., ex1 misses 5-to-7 horizontal merge).

(This sorts bboxes per color by top row then left col, enabling queue-based "first available" selection; helpful and correct, but may need refinement for multi-block ordering.)

```
(These fill straight gaps correctly if bboxes align, using start color; helpful but limited—only works for perfect row/col alignment, misses partial overlaps or non-straight needs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core connection logic is flawed despite good block detection.
 * Ex1 generated: Connected some 1-5 and 1-7 vertically/horizontally in upper sections (e.g., filled 1's around 2/5/7), but missed key horizontal merges like 5-to-7 in rows 2-3 (generated has separate 5's and 7's; expected connects 7's across cols 11-16 with 7 fills), 1-to-3 in rows 9-10 (generated leaves gap; expected fills 3's into col5-6), and bottom 4-to-2 (generated no fill; expected 4's extend to col13-16). Also, row12 has 9's but no connection to prior. Unknown why 7's didn't merge—possibly wrong bbox pairing or alignment check.
 * Ex2 generated: Filled some vertical 1's and 7's (e.g., row6 col2/4/6/8/10/12/14 with 7's? But output shows partial), but missed horizontal extensions like 3 in row4 col6 (expected isolated but connected? Wait, expected has 3 in row4 col6 unchanged, but 5's connect horizontally in row2 col10-12, and 4's connect in row6 col6-8; generated leaves 5's separate at col10 and col12, no 4 merge in row6, and 7's/9's unconnected. Fills overdid some 1's or missed seq order [from legend row11: 2,3,4,6,5,7,9?].
 * Ex3 generated: Detected blocks but minimal fills—e.g., no merges in upper sections (expected connects 3's horizontally in row3 cols3-8, 2's in row3 cols11-15, 9's in row3 cols19-21; generated leaves all separate), lower 4's/6's in row9 cols14-18 unmerged (expected 4's span), and 6's in rows13-17 col11 isolated (expected vertical stack). Also, row20 7's unfilled. Seems to pop wrong blocks from queues, skipping alignments.
 * Overall: Block finding/sorting/legend extraction works (no errors there), but connect_two_blocks fails on non-aligned bboxes (e.g., partial row overlap not handled—fills only full bbox height/width, missing partial gaps) and queue popping assumes strict first-to-first, but seq may require matching closest/aligned blocks, not positional first. No chaining effects (e.g., after connecting A-B, B's new bbox isn't updated for B-C).
 * connect_two_blocks is helpful but broken for partial alignments (e.g., if rows overlap partially, no fill; needs extension to max(min_r, other_min_r) etc.).
 * program overall copies grid correctly and uses queues, but loop only does len(seq)-1 connections without re-finding blocks post-fill, so no iterative merging.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, but fill functions need enhancement for overlap.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills with 2's in many places (e.g., rows 1-5/8-13/15-21 have extensive 2 fills connecting across sections, like row3 col3-8/10-13/21-25, but this merges unrelated blocks and ignores sequence [likely from row26: 4,9,8,9,9,6,4,6,7,6,6,9,9,3,4,3,5,3,3,1,7,... non-1, but 8 is present? Wait, bg=1, legend non-1]. Expected should connect specific pairs like 2-to-4 in upper, but output fills entire rows with 2's, e.g., row16-20 all 2's in cols14-24, which looks like blob expansion rather than targeted gaps. Also, lower row22-25 has 2's filled into what should be isolated, and row27 legend unchanged but 1's overwritten? Misses vertical connections (e.g., 6's/7's in row10/27 unmerged) and creates uniform 2-regions that don't match puzzle's discrete shape extensions. This suggests wrong fill extents or ignoring alignments, making it incoherent for the sequence-based merging.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs (3 examples), the following are **obvious, consistent interactions or connections** between elements. These are limited to properties that appear in **every** train example without variation or exception. Only elements with clear, direct effects or linkages are included (e.g., one property influencing the presence, position, color, or other attributes of another). Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., palette squares, which remain unchanged and isolated) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or rule inference is attempted; unknown aspects (e.g., exact conditions triggering a connection) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Inner Colored Squares (Small, holes=0) → Added Connection Shapes (Elongated, holes=0)**
   - **Description**: Positions of inner colored squares in the 3x3 grid consistently trigger the addition of new elongated shapes (likely line segments) in the output. These new shapes bridge gaps between adjacent inner squares (horizontally or vertically) within the same row or column.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox)**: Inner square positions determine exact placement of new shapes. New shapes occupy intermediate bbox coordinates between two inner squares (e.g., if inner at x=2-3 and x=15-16 in same row, new shape at x=11-13 or similar gap-filling position). Consistent in all 3 trains: ~70-80% of new shapes directly adjoin or span between 2+ existing inner positions.
     - **Size (pixels and bbox dimensions)**: Inner squares (pixels=1-4, compact bbox) lead to new shapes with increased pixels (2-6) and extended bbox (1-2 units longer in horizontal/vertical direction, e.g., from 1x1 to 3x1 or 1x3). No change to inner squares themselves.
     - **Color**: New shapes inherit color from at least one adjacent inner square (e.g., if connecting a Green inner to another, new shape is Green). Consistent match in every added shape across all trains.
   - **Consistency Note**: Appears in every output (7-9 new shapes per example). No new shapes added without nearby inners; all are grid-aligned.
   - **Unknown**: Exact trigger for which pairs of inners get connected (e.g., color match, adjacency type); some potential adjacencies lack connections.

#### 2. **Added Connection Shapes → Background (Large, multi-hole shape)**
   - **Description**: The addition of connection shapes consistently overlaps or covers portions of the background, altering its topology and area.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Hole Count (holes)**: Each new connection shape reduces the background's hole count (e.g., input holes=12-16 → output holes=7-9; reduction of 5-7 per example, scaling with number of connections). Consistent causal link: more connections = larger hole reduction.
     - **Area (pixels)**: Background pixels decrease proportionally to total pixels in new connection shapes (e.g., input ~180-570 → output ~175-558; net loss matches sum of connection pixels). Bbox unchanged.
     - **Color**: Background color (Maroon in all trains) unaffected.
   - **Consistency Note**: Universal in all 3 examples; hole/pixel changes directly correlate with connection additions (no other elements cause background changes).
   - **Unknown**: None for this interaction—direct overlap effect is clear.

#### 3. **Grid Frames (Medium, holes=1) ↔ Inner Colored Squares and Connections**
   - **Description**: Frames provide fixed boundaries that constrain and interact with inner squares and connections; all elements remain within frame bboxes.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox)**: Inner squares and new connections are always positioned inside frame bboxes (e.g., frames at [1,1,4,4], [7,1,10,4], etc.; inners/connections nested within). No spillover in any example.
     - **Color**: Frames (Blue in all trains) do not change color or gain new elements, but their blue-toned borders visually/maskingly interact with connections (some connections appear "blue-toned" in description, though data shows varied colors).
     - **Topology (holes)**: Frames' single hole (holes=1) remains unchanged, but encloses varying numbers of inner holes=0 elements; connections do not alter frame holes.
   - **Consistency Note**: Frames identical in input/output across all trains; all dynamic elements (inners + connections) depend on frame positions for alignment (3x3 grid structure preserved).
   - **Unknown**: Any direct effect from frames to connection creation (positions constrain but do not trigger).

#### Excluded Elements and Rationale
- **Palette Row (Bottom small squares, holes=0, pixels=1)**: No interactions; identical in every input/output, no position/color changes, no links to other elements. Irrelevant to transformations.
- **Test Inputs**: Not compared (no outputs provided); analysis limited to trains for consistency.
- **Inconsistent or Non-Interactive**: Background color variations (Maroon in trains, Blue/others in tests) not analyzed; single-pixel outliers or non-grid elements absent in trains.
- **No Forced Connections**: Semantic meanings (e.g., "pipes" or "circuits") not evident in data; hole counts in small shapes always 0 (no enclosures created). No position→color shifts beyond connections inheriting from inners.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 17:28:08] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where numbered cells (2-9 represent colored blocks or regions, 1s are barriers or walls, and 8 is empty background) must be connected or extended into complete shapes based on a sequence extracted from a "key row" (likely the bottom or a specific row with clues). The goal is to fill gaps in background (8) areas between consecutive blocks in the sequence, respecting overlaps in rows/columns and barrier constraints, to form the expected filled regions without altering existing cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The key row is not always the bottom row; it must be identified as the row (starting from bottom) with 3-12 clue cells (2-9) where the number of runs of consecutive clues equals the clue count (i.e., no adjacent clues, suggesting isolated clues).
 * Sequence extraction skips non-clue cells (1s and 8s), creating an ordered list of 2-9 values that dictates connection order (e.g., connect block of seq[0] to seq[1], then seq[1] to seq[2], etc.).
 * Blocks are connected components of the same number (2-9), found via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with 4-directional adjacency); each block is represented by its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * Gaps are filled only between consecutive blocks in the sequence if they "overlap" in the perpendicular dimension: for horizontal gaps (no column overlap, but row overlap), fill vertically separated areas; for vertical gaps (no row overlap, but column overlap), fill horizontally separated areas. Fill only background (8) cells, using the color of the first block (c1).
 * Barriers (1s) block filling and connectivity; blocks cannot cross 1s, and gaps cannot be filled over or through 1s.
 * Background is hardcoded as 8, but in test input, it appears to be 1 in some places (e.g., borders and separators), suggesting 1 might serve dual role as barrier and possible background in unfilled areas— this is a subtlety, as code assumes 8 is fillable bg.
 * Connections may require multiple passes or considering all pairs in sequence, but current code does one pass popping blocks left-to-right, which may mismatch if multiple blocks per color exist or if order is wrong.
 * Subtle: Overlap calculation uses max(0, end - start +1) for rows/columns; if no overlap in one dimension but gap in the other, fill the gap fully in the overlap range, but only if gap_start > gap_end is false (i.e., actual gap exists).
 * Easy to miss: Blocks are sorted by (min_r, min_c) per color, and deques popleft() assumes leftmost/topmost blocks are used first for connections, but this may not match puzzle intent if sequence implies specific pairings (e.g., nearest or spatially logical).
 * No filling if blocks already touch or overlap fully; also, no diagonal connections—only orthogonal.
 * In expectations, some regions extend beyond simple gaps (e.g., in ex1, 7 extends horizontally into what looks like barrier-adjacent areas, and vertically in other places; in ex2, 2 and 5 extend across barriers? Wait, no—looking closely, extensions respect 1s but fill 8s into shapes).
 * Puzzle may involve "stretching" or merging blocks only if they are the "next" in sequence, and unused blocks remain as-is.
 * All changes are non-destructive (deepcopy g, only fill if ==bg).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly identifies isolated-clue rows as keys and extracts sequences accurately (e.g., for ex1, seq likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5], skipping 8s).
 * What worked: Block detection via connected components is solid (preserves existing shapes like the 1-bordered regions); gap-filling logic correctly checks overlaps and only fills bg=8, avoiding overwrites; uses deques for ordered block consumption per color.
 * What didn't work: Fails to connect all required gaps—e.g., in ex1, 7 blocks not extended leftward into col11-13 or rightward fully (generated has isolated 7s in col14-15 row2-3 and col15-16 row2-3? Wait, output shows 7,7,1 in row2 col14-16, but expected has 7s in col11-13 and 15-17 row2-3, plus vertical extensions? Unknown why partial); similarly, 2 in row5-7 col2-3 not connected downward, 3 in row9-10 col1-5 not fully horizontal to col5-6, 4 in row14-15 col8-9 not extended right to col11-14, etc. Differences: Generated leaves many 8s unfilled where expected has color extensions (e.g., row2 col11-13=7, row5 col2-3=2 extended down; row9 col5-6=3; row13 col8-10=9? No, row13 has 9,9 in col8-9 expected but not in generated; generated row13 all 8s except later).
 * In ex2: Minimal filling (only existing blocks), but expected connects 2 horizontally in row2 col3 and col4-5? (generated has 2 only at row2 col2), 3 vertical? No, row4 col2=3 expected but not, 5 in row2 col10 and col12-13 connected; 4 in row6 col6-7 extended right? Differences: Generated ignores most connections, leaving isolated singles (e.g., no 2 at row2 col4, no 3 at row4 col6, no 4 extensions in row6 col8-9, no 5 at row2 col12-13); unknown if block popping order mismatches spatial needs.
 * In ex3: Some vertical stacking in lower blocks (e.g., 6 repeated in rows13-17 col11), but expected has horizontal extensions like 3 in row3 col6-8, 2 in row3 col11-13 and col17? No, and 4 in row9 col14-16, 9 vertical in row6 col19-20? Differences: Generated fills vertically downward for some (e.g., row18-22 all 1-frames with no fills), but misses horizontal merges (e.g., row3: generated has single 3 at col3, single 2 at col11, single 9 at col19; expected has 3x3 at col3-5? Wait row3 col3=3, but extended to col6-8=3; 2 at col11 extended to 13; 9 single but vertical later); also overfills? No, but leaves upper regions unfilled (e.g., row6 all 8s, expected has 9 at col19).
 * Block sorting and popleft() assumes sequential left/top pairing, but may need nearest-block matching or all-pairs checking.
 * find_key_row fallback to h-2 works if bottom is key, but in ex3 (27 cols? rows), it may pick wrong if multiple candidates.
 * No handling for multiple blocks per color in sequence (e.g., two 2s in seq for ex1); pops only one per pair, leaving others unused.
 * deepcopy and main program structure is good, but loop only for i in range(len(seq)-1), assuming one-to-one blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to partially fill some 2-regions (e.g., extending 2s horizontally/vertically within 1-frames in rows1-6,9-13,15-20,21-25? But places singletons like 4 at row3 col3, 8 at row3 col10 (8 is bg, shouldn't place?), 9 at row3 col22, 6 at row10 col3, etc., which seem like misplaced or unconnected clues rather than merged shapes.
 * Issues: Fills large 2 areas but ignores sequence order—bottom row27 seq likely [4,9,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7] (skipping 1s), so should connect 4 to 9 horizontally/vertically in gaps, but generated has scattered singles (e.g., 4 at row16 col14? But no merges; 8 placed erroneously?); upper regions like row15-20 have 2s filled in col14-18 and col20-24, but no color-specific extensions (all 2s, ignoring seq colors); borders are 1s, so bg=1? But code assumes 8, causing no fills where 1 is "bg" (e.g., inner areas unfilled properly). Does not match expected logic, as shapes should be color-specific merges (e.g., connect first 4 block to first 9, filling 1-gaps if possible, but respects 1-barriers); looks like over-reliance on 2-fills (perhaps misidentified key or seq), missing multi-color connections; unknown why singles like 8/9/4 appear without expansion.

- **Background**: Deep magenta (purple-red) fill across the entire canvas in the first two images; solid blue background in the third image.
- **Grid Structure**: 3x3 arrangement of larger squares (each approximately 2x2 units) in the top two-thirds of the first two images; irregular placement of 3x3 smaller squares within larger red or blue frames in the third image; additional linear row of 8 small standalone squares at the bottom in the first two images (missing purple in the second).
- **Outer Frames/Borders**: Consistent thin blue borders around each of the 9 larger squares in the first two images; in the second image, some borders extend into vertical magenta bars connecting rows; third image features larger red outer squares containing smaller inner squares, with blue borders on some.
- **Inner Squares**: Each larger square contains one centered smaller square (about 1x1 unit) in varied colors—red, orange, purple, green, blue, pink, yellow—positioned as follows in the first image: row1 (red/orange/purple), row2 (green/blue/pink), row3 (yellow/empty/empty but implied); second image mirrors but with magenta vertical intrusions; third image has 9 small colored squares (yellow/maroon/cyan; magenta/purple/yellow; cyan/yellow/orange/green) inside red squares, plus a bottom row of 8 tiny colored dots/squares (yellow/maroon/cyan/magenta/pink/cyan/yellow/orange/green/purple).
- **Color Palette**: Primary colors include red, green, blue, yellow, orange, pink (magenta), purple (violet); used for fills of inner squares, frames, bars, and bottom legend; bottom row in first two images serves as a color key with small squares in red/green/cyan/yellow/red/pink/purple/orange (second missing one).
- **Variations and Patterns**: First image is a clean 3x3 grid with bottom legend; second introduces magenta vertical connectors between some squares, altering the grid into a partial circuit-like pattern; third shifts to red-dominated layout with embedded small multicolored elements and a dotted bottom legend, suggesting a transformation or output state.

[2025-10-02 17:28:33] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

The following are obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across all train input/output pairs (and structurally present in test inputs, though unverified without outputs). These focus solely on elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every example, based on changes from input to output. Only properties with direct, repeatable effects (e.g., position influencing addition of new elements, color influencing new element properties) are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., static blue frame shapes without changes, bottom legend colors without positional variance) are excluded unless they enable interactions. No high-level interpretation or full puzzle logic is provided; unknown aspects (e.g., exact pixel scaling factors beyond area) are noted.

#### Components Involved
- **Background Shape**: Large encompassing shape (Maroon in train inputs/outputs, Blue in test inputs; high holes count, full-canvas bbox like [0,0,W,H], high pixels). Affected by additions elsewhere.
- **Frame Shapes**: Medium rectangular shapes (Blue holes=1 in trains, Red or Maroon holes=1 in tests; fixed bboxes like [1,1,4,4] or scaled variants; consistent pixels per size, e.g., 12 for ~4x4 area minus inner). Static but define spatial constraints for interactions.
- **Inner Shapes**: Small colored rectangles (holes=0; colors from palette: Red, Green, Blue/Light Blue, Yellow, Orange, Pink/Maroon, Dark Red/Purple; small bboxes like [2,2,3,3], pixels 1-4; positioned inside frame bboxes).
- **Palette Shapes**: Tiny bottom-row squares (holes=0; 1 pixel each; fixed positions like y=18 or 25, x=odd increments; colors match inners). Define ordering for color-based interactions.
- **Added Shapes** (output-only): New small colored rectangles (holes=0; same colors as inners; bboxes in gaps; pixels vary by gap size). Emerge from interactions.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections
1. **Frame Position → Inner Position Containment**:
   - Inner shapes are always positioned within the bbox of a frame shape (e.g., inner [2,2,3,3] inside frame [1,1,4,4]; scaled in larger examples like [3,3,3,3] inside [1,1,5,5]).
   - Consistent in every input and output: No inners outside frames; frames unchanged, acting as fixed spatial boundaries for potential interactions.
   - Effect: Limits interactions to within/around frame-defined grid (3x3 or irregular in tests); gaps between frames enable new placements.

2. **Palette Position → Inner Color Indexing**:
   - Each inner shape's color is mapped to an index based on its first (or contextually relevant) horizontal position in the palette row (e.g., leftmost Red = index 1, next Green = 2; duplicates like second Red in train 1 treated as separate index ~5 for adjacency checks).
   - Consistent in every example: Palette order (left-to-right x-positions) determines "sequence" for color comparisons; unchanged across input/output.
   - Effect: Colors with adjacent indices (diff = 1, e.g., Green index 2 and Yellow index 3) enable interactions; non-adjacent (diff >1) do not. Unknown: Precise index for duplicate colors (e.g., Red in train 1) when ambiguous, but consistently allows expected additions.

3. **Adjacent Inner Positions + Color Indices → Added Shape Creation**:
   - Horizontally or vertically adjacent inner shapes (sharing row/column via frame grid, e.g., row1 col1 and row1 col2) interact if their color indices differ by exactly 1.
   - Consistent in every train input/output: Additions occur only in such cases (e.g., train 1 row2 Green index 2 + Light Blue index 3 → add; train 2 col3 Orange index 5 + Dark Red index 6 → add; no add for non-diff=1 like Green 2 + Orange 5). Vertical same (e.g., train 2 col2 row1 Green 2 + row2 Yellow 3 → add). Tests show similar adjacencies setup but unverified.
   - Effect: Creates one new added shape per qualifying pair, placed in the spatial gap between the two inners (e.g., x-gap between [3,3] and [8,2,9,3] → new at [5,9,6,10]).

4. **Interacting Color Indices → Added Shape Color**:
   - The added shape takes the color of the interacting pair's smaller (lower) index.
   - Consistent in every train: E.g., train 1 row1 Orange index 7 + Dark Red index 6 → add Dark Red (index 6); train 3 row2 Pink index 5 + Yellow index 4 → add Yellow (index 4); train 2 vertical col3 Orange 5 + Pink 4 → add Pink (4). Applies regardless of left/right or upper/lower position.
   - Effect: Directly transforms color property from pair to new shape; no additions without this index match.

5. **Interacting Positions (Gap) → Added Shape Position and Pixels**:
   - Added shape's bbox exactly fills the gap between the two interacting inners' bboxes (horizontal gap: same y-range, x-span gap; vertical gap: same x-range, y-span gap).
   - Consistent in every train: E.g., train 1 horizontal gap x=11-13 y=2-3 → add [11,2,13,3]; train 3 vertical gap y=12-16 x=11 → add [11,12,11,16]. Pixels = gap width * gap height (e.g., w=3 h=2 → 6; w=1 h=1 → 1; w=3 h=1 → 3).
   - Effect: Position directly determines new bbox; pixels scale with gap dimensions (unknown: exact units for bbox inclusivity, but consistently matches area formula). No additions outside gaps.

6. **Added Shapes (Total Pixels) → Background Pixels**:
   - Background pixels decrease exactly by the sum of all added shapes' pixels (e.g., train 1 adds total 32 pixels → background 264 → 232; train 2 adds total 6 → 181 → 175; train 3 adds total 15 → 573 → 558).
   - Consistent in every train: Reflects background as "remaining canvas fill" after foreground additions; bbox unchanged. Tests show similar large background but unverified change.
   - Effect: Cumulative additions affect background property; no other factors observed influencing this.

7. **Added Shapes (Count) → Background Holes**:
   - Background holes decrease exactly by the number of added shapes created (one per interaction; e.g., train 1: 7 adds → 16 → 9; train 2: 6 adds → 15 → 9; train 3: 5 adds → 12 → 7).
   - Consistent in every train: Each addition "punches" one hole (independent of added pixels/size). Frames' holes=1 remain fixed and do not affect this.
   - Effect: Number of interactions directly reduces background holes; no additions → no change (but all examples have changes).

#### Non-Interactions / Exclusions
- No consistent effects from shape holes (inners/added=0 always; frames=1 static; background holes only passively reduced).
- No interactions involving irrelevant elements (e.g., bottom palette positions unchanged, no self-interaction; no diagonal or non-grid adjacencies trigger adds).
- Color palette unchanged; no feedback from adds to palette.
- Unknown transformations: Why specific duplicate color indices are selected in context (e.g., which Red in train 1); exact canvas total pixels per example (inferred but consistent with subtractions); no observed effects in tests without outputs. No forced explanations for these.

[2025-10-02 17:31:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style polyomino puzzle on a grid, where 1s represent walls or barriers, 8s are background/empty space, and scattered numbers (2-9) in the grid and possibly a clue row at the bottom indicate the required size of connected polyomino regions (orthogonally adjacent cells of the same number must form exactly N cells for a clue N). The task is to resolve and fill ambiguous or partial regions by expanding/connecting same-number cells into complete polyominoes of the exact size, without overlapping walls or background, while leaving walls, background, and the clue row unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are bounded by 1s (walls) and 8s (background); fillings must stay within these enclosures and cannot cross them—treat 1s and 8s as impassable.
 * Each number N must form exactly one or more polyominoes of size exactly N; cells with the same N must connect orthogonally (up/down/left/right, no diagonals) to form these shapes, and no polyomino can be larger or smaller than N.
 * Partial clues (single N cells) need to be expanded by claiming adjacent empty cells (non-1, non-8) to reach size N; if multiple possible expansions, resolve based on fitting all clues without conflict (e.g., don't overclaim space needed for another number).
 * The bottom row (e.g., [8, 2, 8, 3, ...]) acts as a fixed clue legend or seed row—do not modify it; it provides initial N placements that must be expanded upward into the grid.
 * Subtle: Some regions may have multiple clues of the same N, requiring multiple separate polyominoes of size N; avoid merging different Ns or same N across walls. Empty regions without clues might remain 8s or need inference from fitting.
 * Overlapping possibilities: If a region has space for multiple polyominoes, prioritize exact fits; e.g., a clue 7 in a larger space might need to snake or L-shape to fill exactly 7 cells without leaving orphans.
 * Edge cases: Thin corridors (e.g., 1-cell wide) limit shapes; vertical/horizontal stretches must match sizes (e.g., a 2x2 block for 4, not a 1x4 line if it doesn't fit clues). Background 8s in regions might be "empty" but can be filled if needed for polyominoes.
 * All training examples show the bottom clue row unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming it's fixed. Grids vary in width (20, 20, 27 cols across examples), so handle variable dimensions.
 * No diagonals for connectivity; only 4-directional adjacency.
 * If a region has no clues, leave as 8s; if overconstrained (impossible fit), but assuming inputs are solvable.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single prior program used flood-fill on non-background/non-wall cells to identify components, then applied rules like filling with "minority color" if no 1s or filling non-1 cells with the other color if 1s present—but this misinterprets the puzzle as color-based merging rather than size-constrained polyomino expansion.
 * Worked: Correctly detected some connected components (e.g., in Train 1, it kept existing 2s,5s,7s in place without overwriting clues); identified walls (1s) and background (8s) accurately; preserved the bottom clue row unchanged.
 * Didn't work: Ignored polyomino size rules entirely—e.g., filled entire components with one number regardless of size (overfilling 7s as just two cells instead of expanding to seven); treated 1s as "walls to fill around" but didn't use them as boundaries for exact N-shapes; minority/majority logic led to arbitrary fills (e.g., Train 1 row 2 kept 7s as two cells, missing extension to [7,7,7,7,7,7? wait no, expected has three 7s in middle and three on right, but generated only two each).
 * Train 1 differences: Generated missed vertical extensions (e.g., rows 6-8 should have 2s in cols 2-3 and 6s in cols 16-17, but output has all 8s there); row 10 has 3s only in two cells but expected extends to six 3s (cols 1-6); row 14 all 8s/1s but expected has 9s in cols 8-9 and 2s in 16-17; unknown why it didn't expand from bottom clues upward.
 * Train 2 differences: Generated left many areas as 1s or unchanged, e.g., row 2 has 2 and 3 isolated but expected connects 2s across (cols 2 and 4); row 4 all 8s but expected has 3 in col 6; row 6 has 7 and 4 isolated but expected connects 4s (cols 6-8? wait, cols 6 and 8 for 4); row 5 has 3 in col 6 but generated empty; failed to expand bottom clues (e.g., 3,4,6 into vertical polyominoes).
 * Train 3 differences: Similar isolation issues—e.g., row 3 has 3,2,9 as singles but expected expands 3 to cols 3-6 (four 3s?), 2 to cols 11-15 (five 2s?), 9 unchanged? Wait, expected has 3s in 3-6 and 3s in 7-9? No, row 3 expected: 3 at col3, then 1s, but actually expands horizontally/vertically; generated missed most expansions (e.g., row 9 has 6 and 4 isolated, expected connects 6s? and 4s in cols 14-18); rows 13-17 all 8s/6? but generated empty, expected has vertical 6s in col11; bottom expansions ignored entirely.
 * extract_regions (from the program) is helpful for finding bounded areas but broken for polyomino logic—needs integration with clue sizes (don't use raw minority fill). No other functions in the attempt; color_count logic is unhelpful/irrelevant (puzzle isn't about colors, but numbers as sizes—discard it).
 * Overall: Attempt shows basic component detection but zero grasp of Fillomino rules (no size enforcement, no expansion from clues), leading to underfilled grids; bottom clues not propagated upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills large rectangular blocks without respecting polyomino sizes (e.g., rows 1-6 have a 5x6 block of 4s, which is 30 cells, but if seeded from a single 4 clue, it should be exactly 4 cells, not 30; similarly, 5-row 9s block is 25 cells, way over size 9). 
 * It treats entire row-spanning areas as single fills (e.g., cols 8-12 as 8s across multiple rows, but 8 is background—should not fill with 8 if claiming for polyominoes; expected likely has smaller, connected shapes like 4-cell 4s snaking around 1s). 
 * Bottom row clues (e.g., 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) are unchanged (good), but no upward expansion visible (e.g., col1 has 4 in bottom, but above it rows 15-20 have 9s/4s/5s/3s, not connected to bottom 4). 
 * Borders of 1s are preserved, but inner empties (implied 8s?) are wrongly uniform-filled, ignoring exact N sizes—e.g., a 5x5 block of 5s would be 25 cells, not size 5; this mismatches Fillomino, where shapes must be exactly N connected cells per clue. 
 * Unknown why it filled with 8s in some blocks (e.g., cols 8-12), as 8 is background—perhaps mistaking empty regions, but expected should fill with numbers from nearby clues or leave empty only if no fit. Overall, it looks like crude region painting, not size-aware polyominoes; to fix, start from each clue position and grow exactly N cells using BFS/possible shapes, resolving conflicts by backtracking or deduction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a 2D array of integers representing colors or fills (1 likely as background/white, 2+ as colored regions, 8 as unknowns/blanks to be resolved, and other numbers like 3-9 as special markers or obstacles). The goal is to transform the grid by applying rules to fill or adjust 8's and possibly other elements based on patterns like bounded regions or connections, ensuring consistency across rows and potentially columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 8's should be filled only if they form internal sequences bounded by the same non-8 color (e.g., >1) on both sides within a row, treating them as part of an extending colored region; however, boundaries must handle edges carefully to avoid assuming a default color like 0.
 * Index bounds are critical: when scanning for left/right non-8 bounds around 8-sequences, the code must prevent out-of-range access (e.g., l < 0 or r >= n), which caused crashes; use safe checks like if l >= 0 before accessing row[l].
 * The puzzle likely involves row-wise processing first, but may require column-wise or global consistency checks, as the grid shows symmetric or repeating patterns (e.g., 2-regions with embedded numbers like 4,6,9 that might act as "seeds" or fixed points not to overwrite).
 * Subtle elements: Embedded numbers (3-9) in colored regions (e.g., 2's) should remain unchanged unless rules specify merging; all-1 rows suggest background filling, but over-filling (e.g., turning everything to 1) ignores colored blobs. 8's might only fill if bounds are strictly same and non-background (not 1). Training errors indicate the need for robust edge cases, like 8's at row starts/ends or isolated 8's.
 * Global considerations: The grid has vertical symmetry and repeating 2-blob structures with varying embedded numbers (e.g., row 3 has 4 and 9 in 2's, row 10 has 6,7,4,9); rules might propagate fills vertically or match patterns across the grid. Deepcopy is useful to avoid mutating input, but ensure the function returns a modified copy.
 * Potential misses: Not handling cases where 8's are adjacent to 1's (background) without a matching bound; ignoring vertical influences (e.g., 8 in row 4 might align with patterns above/below); assuming left_c/right_c >1 without verifying they are actual colors (1 might be invalid for filling).

    return g
```
(Note: This function is conceptually helpful for row-wise 8-filling but is currently broken due to potential index errors in bound finding; it could be fixed with better sentinels or conditional access. No other types/tools from attempts, as this is the primary one.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on filling internal 8-sequences in rows bounded by matching colors >1, which aligns with a core rule for resolving blanks in colored regions.
 * What worked: Successfully deepcopy'd the grid to avoid mutation; generated a partial output for the test input without crashing it (unlike training); correctly skipped non-8 cells and identified sequences.
 * What didn't work: Caused "list assignment index out of range" errors in all three training examples, likely due to unsafe access when l < 0 or r >= n during bound finding (e.g., row[l] or row[r] without checks); in test, it failed to fill the 8 in row 4 (position 3: [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]) because left bound (1) != right bound (1? but interrupted by 9), leaving 8 unchanged and not propagating any fills; over-filled some rows to all 1's? Wait, no—the output shows mostly unchanged rows with 8 intact, suggesting the filling condition never triggered properly.
 * The program function simply wraps the fill_eights, which is minimal but doesn't address vertical or multi-pass rules, missing broader puzzle elements like connecting 2-blobs vertically.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., blobs or regions) was attempted, which might be essential for identifying bounded areas globally; this attempt assumes purely row-local rules, ignoring potential column interactions.
 * Training mismatches: All errored out, so no validation; unknown why index errors occurred (possibly training grids have 8's at edges without sentinels), but it demonstrates lack of robustness.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It largely mirrors the input grid (assuming standard input has similar structure), with the 8 in row 4 (0-indexed) remaining unfilled (output shows [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]), and embedded numbers like 9,4,7 unchanged, but no evident filling of 8's despite the rule intent—suggesting the bounding condition failed (left of 8 is 1, right is 1 but with 9 nearby, possibly not matching strictly).
 * Many rows are output as repeating 1's or partial 2-blobs (e.g., row 1: [1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,...] unchanged), which might be correct if no 8's to fill, but the all-1 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,7) look like background preservation; however, later rows like 15-19 show 2-blobs with embedded 9,4,5,3 which remain, indicating no overwriting happened.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should resolve the 8 to match surrounding pattern (e.g., fill to 1 or extend a color, but based on rules, possibly to 4 if bounded by 4's—though here bounds are 1's); instead, 8 persists, and no vertical consistency (e.g., row 27 mirrors row 4 with 8 and 9's unfilled). This doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as 8's are unresolved blanks; it seems like the code ran but skipped filling due to mismatched bounds or bugs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a Fillomino-style logic puzzle where a grid (with 8s representing empty/unfilled cells, 1s likely acting as boundaries, dividers, or pre-filled non-polyomino cells, and scattered numbers 2-9 as given clues in the bottom row) must be filled such that groups of identical numbers form orthogonally connected polyominoes exactly matching the number's value (e.g., three 3's connected together). The program attempts to automate filling by propagating numbers horizontally into sequences of 8s based on nearby clues or bounds, but it ignores vertical connections, full polyomino validation, and multi-step deduction.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Polyominoes must be exactly the size of the number (e.g., a 5 requires exactly five connected 5's; no more, no less), and same-number polyominoes cannot touch orthogonally even if separate groups.
 * 8s are empty cells to be filled; 1s appear to serve as fixed boundaries or walls that cannot be part of polyominoes (they block horizontal/vertical propagation and remain 1s in outputs).
 * Clues (2-9) are given primarily in the bottom row, separated by 8s, but fillings can extend vertically into upper rows; horizontal-only filling misses cases where polyominoes span rows (e.g., vertical stacks like three 2's in rows 5-7 of train1 expected output).
 * Deduction often requires looking beyond immediate bounds: if a sequence of 8s is bounded by 1s, the fill number comes from the nearest clue (left or right), but only if the sequence length matches or can connect to form the exact polyomino size; over-filling (e.g., assigning a number to a sequence longer/shorter than needed) breaks the rule.
 * Subtle: Some regions remain 8s if they are not part of any clue-based polyomino (e.g., isolated 8s between groups in train1 row2 positions 5-6 stay 8, not filled with 5). Propagation must consider both directions and avoid assuming all 8-sequences are fillable—some are "gaps" between polyominoes.
 * The bottom row (clues) is untouchable (skipped in processing), and the puzzle assumes orthogonal (up/down/left/right) connectivity only—no diagonals.
 * Edge cases: Single-cell clues (rare, but if length=1 bounded by 1s, it may copy the nearest clue directly); long 1-sequences may indicate separate regions; vertical priority over horizontal in conflicts (e.g., train1 rows 5-7 fill vertically with 2's and 6's despite horizontal 8s).
 * All attempts fail to validate polyomino sizes post-filling (e.g., no check if a filled group actually connects to exactly N cells), leading to overfills or wrong numbers.
 * Grids vary in size (20x20 for train1/2, 27x27 for train3), so dimension handling is key, but processing only upper rows (skipping bottom) is correct but insufficient without vertical logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
```
(This is a simple, correct utility for getting grid height/width; useful for iteration bounds.)

The main `program` function is an attempt at filling logic but is broken overall (see below); it correctly identifies horizontal 8-sequences but fails on number selection and vertical integration. No other helper functions are provided, but a potential useful addition could be a function to find nearest clue horizontally/vertically:
```python
def find_nearest_clue(g: List[List[int]], row: int, col: int, direction: str) -> int:
    # Example stub: search left/right/up/down from (row, col) for first 2-9, skipping 1s and 8s
    # Return 0 if none found
    pass
```
(This is conceptual; not in the attempt but would help for better propagation than the attempt's buggy left/right search.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and skips the bottom clue row, uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, and properly detects horizontal sequences of 8s bounded by non-8s (e.g., correctly fills the two 2's in train1 row2/3 bounded by 1s, matching expected).
 * It works for simple cases where a horizontal 8-sequence is directly bounded by matching clues >1 (e.g., partial matches in train1 for 7's in row2/3), and sometimes picks the right number from left/right when bounded by 1s (e.g., 3's in train9/10).
 * However, it fails to handle vertical propagation entirely—no code for checking/connecting across rows, leading to misses like the vertical 2's and 6's in train1 rows5-7 (generated keeps 8s, expected fills them) and vertical 6's in train3 rows13-17 (generated all 8s, expected 6's in col11).
 * Bug in bound detection: The left/right bound finding loops incorrectly extend bounds if adjacent 8s (e.g., in train1 row2, it over-extends left/right for the 5-clue area, filling positions 5-6 with 5's where expected 8,8 as a gap).
 * Flawed 1-bounded logic: When bounded by 1s, it prefers left clue but only if left 1-sequence length==1, else right— this is arbitrary and wrong (e.g., in train1 row9, it picks 9 for a sequence that should be 3 from left, and fills 6's correctly but in wrong spot; in train2 row2, it leaves 3's as 1's instead of filling adjacent 8? Wait, input unclear but generated has 1,2,1,2 instead of expected 1,2,1,2 but misses later 3/8).
 * In train3, it fills upper horizontal groups (e.g., 3's and 2's in row3) but completely ignores lower vertical stacks (e.g., expected 6's in rows13-17 col11 stay 8s; expected 4's in row9 col14-16 become wrong 6,1,1 or similar—mismatch in positioning).
 * Over-filling issue: Fills sequences longer than the clue (e.g., train1 row9 fills four 9's? but clue is 9, yet expected uses 3's instead, suggesting vertical or size mismatch not checked).
 * The while-loop for sequence detection skips non-8 cells correctly but doesn't revisit after filling (no iterative propagation), so partial fills don't trigger further changes (e.g., train2 misses filling after initial 8's to 3/4).
 * Function `program` is partially helpful for horizontal detection but broken for full solving (don't reuse without vertical logic and validation); the inner left/right clue search is unhelpful/buggy as it skips 1s but doesn't search vertically or validate size.
 * All training examples incorrect: Train1 mismatches in filled gaps (e.g., extra 5's/9's where 8's/3's expected) and misses verticals; Train2 mismatches in partial horizontals (e.g., generated 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,3 but expected 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,8 and vertical 3/4/6/7/9 in row4/6); Train3 mismatches in verticals (e.g., no 6's or 4's in lower rows) and some horizontals (e.g., row9 has 6,1,1,6,6,6 but expected 6,1,1,4,4,4).
 * Unknown reasons for some mismatches (e.g., why train1 row10 fills 8,8,8 with 6's correctly but row9 overfills 9's—possibly bound detection error in while l >=0 and g[i][l]==8).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-fills nearly the entire grid with groups of five 2's (e.g., rows2-6 have long horizontal 2,2,2,2,2 sequences bounded by 1s), but this ignores clue sizes in the bottom row (e.g., clues like 4,9,4,7,6,9 require exact polyominoes of those sizes, not all 2's; a group of five 2's would need to be part of ten 2's total for validity, but no such connection exists).
 * It treats borders as all 1s (e.g., row0 all 1s, many rows starting/ending with 1s), suggesting the input had 8s replaced indiscriminately, but expected should leave gaps as 1s or 8s and form vertical/horizontal polyominoes matching bottom clues (e.g., a 9-clue should have nine connected 9's spanning rows, not scattered 2's or 9's in single positions like row3 col22).
 * Wrong numbers in key spots: e.g., row17 has 2,2,9,2,2 but a 9 should connect to eight more 9's (not isolated); row18 has scattered higher numbers (9,4,2,2,5,2,2,3,2,2) that don't form valid polyominoes (e.g., single 9 can't be valid). This indicates the horizontal-only logic failed on a larger/wider grid (29 cols?), creating artificial 1-boundaries and ignoring vertical needs.
 * To handle test, must add vertical search/propagation and size validation (e.g., after filling a group, count connected same-number cells == number value).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style logic puzzle on a grid with walls (cells marked 1, which block regions), clue cells (numbers 2-9 indicating the exact size of the connected region that cell belongs to), and empty cells (marked 8, to be filled with numbers 2-9 such that all connected cells sharing the same number form a polyomino of exactly that size, without crossing walls or clues mismatched to their regions). The goal is to deduce and fill all 8s logically based on clues and constraints, ensuring no region violates size rules, clues are satisfied, and the grid is fully resolved without isolated cells or overflows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (1s) act as barriers; regions cannot connect across or include 1s, and 1s themselves are not part of any numbered region.
 * Clues (2-9) must be the starting point for a region of exactly that many connected cells ( orthogonally adjacent, no diagonals), all filled with the same number as the clue; no two different clues can be in the same region unless they match in value and size constraints.
 * Empty cells (8s) must be filled to extend regions logically; single-cell regions are impossible since clues start at 2, so all 8s must connect to existing clues or form new regions only if deducible (but typically all connect back to clues).
 * Horizontal and vertical fillings must consider adjacent clues and skipped walls (1s between sequences of 8s), but cannot assume fills without verifying total region size; over-filling (e.g., long chains of the same number exceeding the clue value) violates rules.
 * Special cases for all-8 rows: These may need targeted filling based on bottom clues (e.g., if a specific clue like bottom[13]==9 triggers patterns), but must avoid assuming offsets without bounds checking; even/odd indexing for offsets risks skipping or duplicating fills.
 * Subtle deduction rules: When 8s are bounded by clues on left/right (or up/down), fill with the matching clue if sizes align (e.g., equal clues with no/minimal skipped 1s); if unequal, prefer the closer/bounding clue or use length of 8s sequence to decide (e.g., short sequences like length=1 or 2 favor smaller/nearer clues, but only if total region won't exceed); symmetric cases (equal skipped 1s) require checking sequence length against clue (e.g., length=3 with 1 skipped might take max/min based on puzzle norms).
 * Avoid naive fills: Do not fill entire sequences of 8s with a single number without counting total connected cells (including vertical/horizontal extensions); this can create oversized regions (e.g., five 2s in a row is invalid for size 2).
 * Grid structure: Clues often in bottom/top rows separated by 1s; upper grid has blocks of 1s (solid walls) and open areas with 8s; fills must propagate across rows/columns without leaving isolated 8s.
 * Edge cases: Zero skipped 1s allows direct propagation from one side; multiple skipped 1s (e.g., 1 or 2) may block or weight toward one clue; clues like 9 may indicate large regions spanning multiple rows.
 * Full resolution: Program must iterate fills (horizontal then vertical, possibly multiple passes) until no 8s remain; partial fills (leftover 8s) indicate incomplete logic.
 * No diagonals or wrapping; regions are strictly orthogonal polyominoes.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `fill_all8_rows`: Broken due to index out of range errors (e.g., accessing offset_cols[ii-1] when ii exceeds len(offset_cols), or assuming fixed indices like g[h-2][13]==9 without grid validation); overly specific to unconfirmed patterns (e.g., even/odd ii for offsets +3 from clues); does not generally help deduce regions and causes crashes—remove or heavily refactor.
 * No region size validation function: All attempts lack a post-fill check to ensure no region exceeds its number (critical flaw); without this, fills are speculative and invalid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (no prior ones detailed) focused on horizontal/vertical filling of 8 sequences bounded by clues, with heuristics for unequal clues (prefer nearer/bounding, adjust by skipped 1s and sequence length) and special all-8 row handling, but failed entirely on training examples due to index errors in `fill_all8_rows` (out of range on offset_cols and fixed [13] access, likely from assuming clue positions without bounds checks).
 * What worked: For the test input, it successfully ran without error and filled many 8s into 2s (e.g., horizontal stretches of five 2s in multiple rows, like rows 1-5 and 8-11), and placed some higher numbers (e.g., 4 at [3][3], 9 at [3][22], 6 at [10][3], 7 at [10][10], 4 at [10][22], 9 at [11][22], 2s extended in lower sections like rows 15-20 with added 9/4/5/3 placements); this shows basic detection of 8 sequences and clue propagation for small/default fills (2s as fallback?).
 * What didn't work: Training examples 1-3 all crashed with "list assignment index out of range" (likely in `fill_all8_rows` when computing/iterating offset_cols or accessing g[h-2][13] on smaller/variable grids); no training passes, indicating non-robust code. For test, filling is incomplete (e.g., row 27 still has an 8 at position 3), and logic is flawed—long horizontal 2-runs (e.g., five connected 2s in row 1 cols 1-5) create invalid regions (size 5 > 2, violating Fillomino rules); vertical connections (e.g., stacked 2s across rows 1-5 in col 1) would compound to even larger invalid regions. Heuristics for fill_n (e.g., taking max/min for length=3 with skipped=1, or preferring left if skipped_left < skipped_right) are ad-hoc and over-aggressive, ignoring total region size; symmetric cases (equal clues/skipped) have inconsistent rules (e.g., min vs max in vertical vs horizontal). No iteration for propagating fills across directions, leaving deductions partial. `fill_all8_rows` contributed nothing useful here (no all-8 rows filled specially, and it may have skipped due to conditions like g[h-2][13]==9 not met).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates partial grasp of bounding clues and sequence filling but misses core region validation, leading to invalid outputs; errors prevent any training success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially filled the grid (e.g., upper blocks like rows 1-6 and 8-13 have patterns of 1s separating stretches of five 2s, with isolated higher numbers like 4/9/6/7 inserted; lower sections rows 15-20 mirror this with 2s and 5/3/9/4; solid 1-rows at 0,6-7,13-14,20-21,25-26,28 act as barriers) but does not look correct overall.
 * Issues: Many 2-fills create oversized regions (e.g., row 1: 2s at cols 1-5 connect horizontally to size 5 >2; vertically, col 1 has 2s in rows 1-5,8-11,15-20 stacking to size 15+ >2, invalid); this suggests the program defaulted to 2s for unknown/bounded 8s without size checks. Higher placements (e.g., 9 at row 3 col 22, 5 at row 17 col 16) might align with nearby clues (bottom row has 9s/5s), but without full connectivity check, they could be wrong (e.g., if the 9-region doesn't reach size 9). Incomplete: Row 27 retains an 8 (at col 3, between 4 and 1,9 clues), meaning deduction failed there—likely needs vertical propagation from above or better bounding logic. Expected output should have no 8s left, all regions exactly matching their number (e.g., 2s only in isolated domino pairs, 9s in nonominoes connecting to clue positions), and no overflows; this output violates that by over-filling 2s and leaving gaps, so it mismatches a correct resolution (difference likely due to lack of region counting and multi-pass deduction).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a region-filling puzzle on a grid where 1's serve as impassable boundaries (walls), 8's are empty cells to be filled, and clue numbers (2-9) are seeds placed within regions; the goal is to identify each connected region (4-way adjacent non-1 cells) bounded by 1's or grid edges, and fill all 8's in that region with the single clue number (2-9) present in it, leaving single-cell regions (like bottom-row clues separated by 8's) unchanged except for their clue.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) groups of 8's and exactly one clue per region; filling must propagate the clue to all connected 8's within the boundaries, even for non-rectangular or L-shaped regions spanning multiple rows/columns.
 * 1's block propagation entirely and are never changed; 8's on the grid edges or outside regions may remain 8's if not part of a fillable region.
 * Bottom row typically contains isolated single-cell regions with clues (2-9) separated by 8's, which stay as-is (clue in place, adjacent 8's unfilled since they may be boundaries or separate).
 * Assume exactly one clue (2-9) per region; no overwriting of existing clues or handling multiple clues per region (puzzle validity assumes this).
 * Propagation must handle vertical, horizontal, and turning connections (e.g., a clue in one row filling adjacent columns in another row); straight-line run filling alone misses complex shapes.
 * Iterative passes (horiz then vert) can approximate propagation but fail if not checking connectivity fully, as runs may not align with region bounds (e.g., bounded by 1's instead of matching clues).
 * Unfilled 8's in generated outputs often indicate missed vertical propagation or regions bounded by 1's (not same >1 clues).
 * Clues like 2-9 in bottom row do not propagate upward unless connected through a region (rarely, as they are isolated).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 20x20 in ex1-2, 27x27? in ex3), with borders often all-8 rows/columns that remain 8's.
 * Subtle: Some regions span multiple rows but are vertically bounded by 1's (e.g., rows 2-3 only), so no spillover to adjacent all-8 rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The previous attempt's `get_dimensions` is useful for getting grid size. No other functions from the attempt are helpful, as the core logic (run-based filling) is flawed for regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt used iterative (20 passes) horizontal and vertical run-filling: finds consecutive 8's in a row/column, extends to find bounding cells, and fills the run only if bounds are identical numbers >1; this worked partially for straight horizontal runs adjacent to clues >1 (e.g., ex1 row2 cols2-3 filled as 2,2; cols8-9 as 5,5; cols15-16 as 7,7; ex2 row2 col2=2 single; ex3 row3 col3=3 single, col11=2 single).
 * Failed completely for regions bounded by 1's (not >1 clues), leaving runs of 8's unfilled (e.g., ex1 row2 cols11-13 stayed 8,8,8 instead of 7,7,7 from a nearby 7 clue in the same row-bounded region; ex3 row3 cols6-8 stayed 1,1,1? but expected 3,3,3 from horizontal propagation within 1-bounded region).
 * Missed all vertical propagation into all-8 areas adjacent to filled rows (e.g., ex1 rows5-7 cols2-3 stayed 8's instead of 2,2; rows5-7 cols15-16 stayed 8's instead of 6,6; ex2 row4 col2 stayed 8 instead of 3; row6 col4-5 stayed 1,4,1? but expected 4,4 from vertical; ex3 rows13-17 col11 stayed 8's? but expected 6's vertically).
 * Did not handle region connectivity across turns/corners (e.g., ex1 row9 cols5-6=3,3 filled horizontally, but if vertically connected, would miss; ex3 row9 cols16-18=4,4,4 expected but gen missed vertical from row10? gen row10 has 1,1,6,1,1 but no full fill).
 * Bottom row clues stayed correctly unfilled around them (e.g., all examples kept isolated 2-9 with surrounding 8's as 8's), as bounds were 8's or edges (condition left_c == right_c >1 not met).
 * Worked for some isolated singles (e.g., ex2 row2 col6=3; ex3 row3 col20=9), but over-relied on bounds matching clues, ignoring 1-bounded regions.
 * Function `fill_horizontal` and `fill_vertical` are broken for this puzzle: they only fill straight runs bounded by matching >1 clues, useless for 1-bounded or multi-direction regions (do not use in future; replace with flood fill).
 * `program` iteration helped propagate some chained horizontal fills but stalled on vertical or bounded cases (e.g., ex1 filled initial 2's/5's/7's but no further).
 * Ex1: Generated mismatched 7's (cols11-13 row2-3=8's vs expected 7's; cols13 row2=8 vs 7; vertical 2's/6's in rows5-7=8's vs expected filled; row9 cols5-6=3,3 correct but row10 cols5-6=3,3 correct? wait gen row10=1,3,3,1 correct; row13 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 9,9?; row14 cols15-16=2,2 correct but reason unknown).
 * Ex2: Mismatched vertical fills (row4 col2=8 vs 3; row4 col10=8 vs 6; row4 col14=8 vs 7; row6 cols4-5=1,4,1? gen 1,4,1 but expected 4,4 vertical from row6 col4=4 seed?; row2 col4=8 vs 2).
 * Ex3: Mismatched horizontal extensions in 1-bounded regions (row3 cols3=3 single vs extended 3's at cols6-8; row9 cols16-18=1,1,1? vs 4,4,4; vertical 6's in rows13-17 col11=8's vs expected 6's; row6 col20=8 vs 9; row18-22 cols20-22=8's vs 7?).
 * `deepcopy` is helpful to avoid mutating input but irrelevant to core logic failure.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrated partial understanding of line-filling but zero grasp of full region flood fill, leading to all training failures; no extraction functions present, but one could be added for regions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows excessive horizontal filling with 2's in long runs bounded by 1's (e.g., row1 cols1-5=2's, row3 cols1-3=2's and cols5-6=2's around a 4 seed without overwriting or unifying the region, row10 cols1-5=2's, row16 cols1-5=2's and cols14-18=2's around 2's but with 5 at col16, row18 cols1-3=2's around 9/4 but kept separate), which suggests the run-filling logic applied blindly without checking region clues or vertical connections.
 * It preserves seeds like 4 (row3 col3), 9 (row3 col22), 6 (row10 col3), 7 (row10 col11), but fills adjacent 8's with 2's incorrectly if those seeds define different regions (e.g., row3 has 4 and 9 isolated but surrounded by 2-fills, implying wrong clue propagation; likely the 2's come from nearby seeds, but verticals like row16-17 cols14-18=2's may miss extensions from row18's 3/5/etc.).
 * Bottom row (row27?) has [1,4,1,8,1,9,...] with 1's as bounds? but fills none around singles, which is partially correct for isolation but wrong if any vertical regions exist above; overall, it looks like partial horizontal fills without full region awareness, leaving potential vertical/mixed connections (e.g., row8 all 1's? vs possible bounds, row15 all 1's) unfilled or mismatched—does not match puzzle rules, as regions with clues like 3/5/7 in row18 should fill connected 8's above/beside, not default to 2's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify background, detect framed blocks containing inner colored regions, extract a sequence of colors from a key row at the bottom, match inners to that sequence, and connect consecutive matched inners with paths of their color—horizontally within blocks and vertically between blocks, including shifting rows for multi-connection gaps. The output is the modified grid with these connections filled in, preserving the original structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the entire grid; all other colors represent objects, frames, or keys.
 * Blocks are vertical stacks of at least 2 consecutive non-background rows; they represent framed regions, and frames are detected as the dominant non-background color in uniform rows within a block (fallback to most frequent non-bg).
 * Inner regions are contiguous horizontal runs of the same non-background, non-frame color within blocks; these are merged vertically if they align in x-range and color, forming rectangular inners.
 * The key row is the bottommost row (scanning downward) with 3-12 isolated runs of non-background cells (total non-bg <=15), treated as single-cell colors in left-to-right order to form the sequence.
 * Inners are assigned to the sequence by matching colors, preferring leftmost unused inner for duplicates.
 * Connections: Horizontal gaps between same-block inners are filled directly if adjacent in x; vertical connections between different blocks use overlapping x-ranges in the gap rows between blocks, but for height-2 gaps with multiple connections, shift the lower block up by 1 row, fill the new single gap row with all connections (overlapping fills), and update positions.
 * Subtleties: Vertical plans only fill if x-overlap exists and gap rows are available; after shifts, remaining verticals are filled straightforwardly. Assume singles in key row (skip one after each non-bg). Fallback key row is h-2 if no match. No diagonal or non-rectangular fills. Preserve bg in fills only if empty.
 * Edge cases: No inners or short sequence skips output. Blocks sorted by y_start. Global updates for shifts affect blocks, key_row, and lower plans. Height-2 multi-conn shifts only bottom-to-top processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) implements a full pipeline for detecting bg, blocks, frames, inners, key row/sequence, assignment, and connections (horizontal direct, vertical with height-2 shift for multiples), but fails entirely due to a Python syntax error: "global key_row" is declared after key_row is used (in the shift logic), causing execution errors in all training examples and test.
 * What worked: Core detection functions (bg, blocks, inners, key row, sequence, assignment) appear logically sound based on puzzle rules; horizontal fills and basic vertical fills would likely work if executed; shift logic attempts to handle multi-connections in tight gaps by inserting space via row shift.
 * What didn't work: The global declaration bug crashes everything before any output; no actual grid modifications occur, so all results are errors instead of grids. Key row update in shifts uses global but is post-use. Assumes single-cell key entries (j +=1 after append), which may miss multi-cell keys. Vertical x-overlap is max(start)-min(end), which could be empty if no overlap. No handling for same-color inners in different blocks without vertical gaps. Fallback frame detection may pick inners as frame if no uniform rows.
 * The main program structure is helpful for future but needs bug fixes; inner extraction via temp_inners and grouping is essential for merging rectangles.
 * No prior attempts, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of sequencing and connections but zero execution success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error, not a grid, so it does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution; expected is a modified grid with connections filled, but nothing generates due to the crash.
 * Specifically, the error prevents any observation of whether detections (e.g., inners, sequence) or fills (e.g., horizontals, verticals with shifts) work for the test input; without running, we can't confirm if the logic would produce correct paths (e.g., if test has height-2 multi-conns needing shift, or non-overlapping verticals to skip).
 * The error output is identical across all examples, indicating the bug is universal and blocks all progress; test likely needs the shift logic (if multi-conns present) or basic verticals, but we can't verify differences from expected without fixed execution—assume incorrect until fixed and outputs grids.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (often 8 or 1) and colored components that form incomplete frames or outlines enclosing small inner regions; the goal is to fill gaps between adjacent or overlapping frames with a specific color chosen based on isolated color markers at the bottom of the grid, effectively completing symmetric or connected shapes while preserving the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is typically the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training examples 1-3, 1 in the test); all fills must only overwrite bg cells, never existing colors.
 * Bottom isolates are single non-bg cells in the bottom row (or near-bottom) flanked by bg on both sides; there must be at least 3 such isolates in a row to be valid, and their positions (indexed from 1) and colors guide color selection for fills via adjacency rules (e.g., choose the color whose position is minimal in adjacent pairs).
 * Frames are medium-sized connected components (5-50 cells) of a single color (frame_color, chosen as the color with the most such components); these enclose 1-8 cell inner regions of a different color, which must be identified within the frame's bounding box.
 * Fills occur between pairs of frames that overlap in one dimension (rows for horizontal pairs, columns for vertical) with a small gap (1-3 bg cells); the fill color is selected from the two inner colors based on bottom isolate adjacency, and fills only the gap rows/columns using the union or range from the inners.
 * Subtlety: Horizontal pairs fill specific rows from the union of inner colored rows; vertical pairs fill specific columns from the chosen inner's range; gaps must be exactly between frames without full overlap or large separations.
 * Overlapping frames must share the overlap dimension but have a gap in the other; inners must be exactly one per frame and small (1-8 cells) to qualify.
 * Easy to miss: Frame_color selection prioritizes medium components but may fail if multiple colors qualify; bottom isolates are only considered if >=3 in a single row; fills don't extend beyond the gap or overwrite non-bg; the bottom row itself has scattered single-color isolates (1-9) that aren't filled but guide the logic.
 * Components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right); visited tracking prevents revisiting in inner extraction.
 * Puzzle assumes a single frame_color; if none found, return unchanged grid.
 * Test input has wider grid (29 cols) and more complex nesting; bg=1, main fill color seems 2 with outliers (3-9); fills must respect multiple levels of frames.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies bg (e.g., 8 or 1) and frame_color via medium component count, and extracts bottom isolates only if >=3 in a row, which works for qualifying valid rows in all training examples.
 * find_components and identify_outers are helpful and correctly find frames/inners (e.g., detects small inners like the 7's in train1 row2-3, 2's in train2 row2-3), but pairing logic in get_pairs fails to detect all overlaps/gaps (e.g., misses horizontal overlap for 7's in train1 rows2-4 cols11-17, where gap=0 but should fill via adjacency).
 * What worked: Some vertical fills partially succeed, like extending 3's and 4's in train1 rows9-11/14-16, but incompletely (e.g., train1 row10 col5-6 filled as 3 but expected full extension); bottom isolate adjacency selection works for simple cases but ignores non-adjacent colors.
 * What didn't: No fills applied in many gap areas, leaving bg (8 or 1) where expected colors propagate (e.g., train1: rows2-4 cols11-13/15-17 remain 8 instead of 7; rows5-7 cols2-3/16-17 remain 8 instead of 2/6; row10 cols1-5/7 remain 8 instead of 3; row13 cols8-9 remain 8 instead of 9; row15 cols11-14 remain 8 instead of 4).
 * Train1 differences: Generated misses horizontal fills for 2 (rows5-7 cols2-3), 6 (rows5-7 cols16-17), 9 (row13 cols8-9), and partial 3/4 extensions; also no vertical fill for 7's across cols11-17 in rows2-4; bottom row unchanged correctly, but isolates not fully guiding all pairs.
 * Train2 differences: Generated misses fills like 2 in row2 col4/row3 col2 (expected 2 extensions); 3 in row4 col6/row6 col2? Wait, row4 is all bg except isolates, but expected 3 at row4 col6; row6 col4-5 as 4 but generated bg; row7 col4 as 4 but generated 1? No, generated has some 4/6 but misses 5 extensions in row7 col10-11? Unknown why partial—perhaps overlap check fails for vertical pairs.
 * Train3 differences: Generated has almost no fills beyond existing (e.g., misses 2 extensions in row3 cols11-15 to 2; 4 in row9 cols14-16/20-21? row10 col19-21 as 4 but generated bg; vertical 6 in rows12-16 col11 as 6 but generated bg; 9 in row6 col19 as 9 but generated bg; row18-22 almost unchanged, missing 8? fills); wider grid causes bbox issues, with inners not paired due to gap>3 or no overlap.
 * get_pairs is broken for vertical fills (e.g., fill_cols from chosen_o only, but should union or extend; overlap_check uses wrong indices for vertical); apply_fills only fills if bg but doesn't handle multi-row/col properly.
 * find_bottom_isolates is helpful but too strict (only one row checked, misses multi-row bottoms in test); get_all_pos correctly maps colors to positions but assumes single row.
 * Overall, attempt understands frame/inner extraction and bottom-guided color choice but fails on pair detection (gaps/overlaps) and fill application (wrong ranges/union), leading to under-filling; no over-filling observed.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it primarily fills large areas with 2 (e.g., rows1-6/8-13/15-? cols1-6/8-13/21-25 as 2, matching some inner 2's) but leaves many bg=1 cells unfilled where extensions are needed (e.g., row3 col6-7/13-? should extend 4/8/9 but remain 1; row10 col3-6/21-24 should extend 6/4 but partial/missing; row17-20 cols14-20/22-25 have some 2 but miss 5/3 extensions like row18 col17 as 5→full row? ; bottom row22-26 have 3/7 but no upward fills to connect).
 * It over-fills some 2 areas beyond frames (e.g., row15-16 cols14-20 as 2, but input has no inner there—perhaps false pair); ignores isolates like 8/9/4/7/6/9/4/5/3/7, only using adjacent for partial 2/4 fills, missing vertical propagations (e.g., no 6 fill in col11 rows8-14).
 * Makes sense for simple horizontal 2 fills but not for complex vertical/nested (e.g., row18 has 9/4/5/3 but no fills above); likely pairing misses small gaps or wrong overlap, leaving ~70% of expected fills undone; to handle test, need better multi-row bottom scan and union fills for vertical pairs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains colored blocks (numbers 1-9 representing colors) separated by background (bg, often 8 or 1), with a legend sequence in the second-to-last row indicating an order to connect consecutive colored blocks by filling straight-line gaps (horizontal or vertical) between them using the color of the starting block in each pair, effectively merging or extending blocks to form paths or shapes matching the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend sequence is extracted from non-bg cells in the second-to-last row (n-2), representing the order of colors to connect (e.g., connect first available block of color A to first of B, then B to C, etc.).
 * Connections only fill background gaps in straight horizontal or vertical lines between bounding boxes of consecutive blocks if they align on the same row(s) or column(s); no diagonal or complex path filling.
 * Multiple blocks per color exist (e.g., several disconnected 2's), so they must be processed in positional order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting by min_r then min_c) using a queue to select the "next" available block for connection.
 * Fill only bg cells; do not overwrite existing non-bg cells, and fills should merge blocks without expanding beyond the gap between bboxes.
 * Background is always the top-left cell's value (e.g., 8 in training, 1 in test); legend skips bg in extraction.
 * Subtle: Connections may chain across the sequence, so popping/using blocks in order can leave later blocks unconnected if wrong pairs are chosen; some expected outputs show horizontal fills spanning multiple columns (e.g., 7's connecting across in ex1 row 2-3) or vertical extensions.
 * Easy to miss: Not all blocks of a color are connected in every step—only consecutive in sequence; leftover blocks remain unchanged. Also, bboxes must be precise (min/max r/c of connected components via flood-fill/DFS/stack).
 * Grids have frame-like 1's in some cases (e.g., outlining shapes), which should not be filled into unless part of a connection.
 * In test case, bg=1 acts as both frame and separator, so fills must distinguish carefully to avoid merging unintended areas.
 * Sequence length is len(legend)-1 connections; process sequentially without revisiting.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills entire row/col spans between bboxes, but if bboxes don't perfectly align (e.g., partial overlap), it may fill extra or miss (e.g., ex1 misses 5-to-7 horizontal merge).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg from top-left; essential and works in all cases.)

```python
def extract_legend(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    return [g[n-2][c] for c in range(m) if g[n-2][c] != bg]
```
(This accurately pulls the sequence from row n-2, skipping bg; works perfectly in examples, e.g., ex1 seq=[2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5].)

```python
def find_connected_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])

    blocks: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]] = defaultdict(list)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(m):
            if g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                col = g[r][c]
                min_r = max_r = r
                min_c = max_c = c
                stack = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    rr, cc = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, rr)
                    max_r = max(max_r, rr)
                    min_c = min(min_c, cc)
                    max_c = max(max_c, cc)
                    for dr, dc in dirs:
                        nr = rr + dr
                        nc = cc + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == col:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                blocks[col].append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return blocks
```
(This flood-fills to find connected components and their bounding boxes correctly; essential for identifying blocks, works in all cases without errors.)

```python
def sort_blocks_by_position(blocks: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]:
    for col in blocks:
        blocks[col] = sorted(blocks[col], key=lambda bbox: (bbox[0], bbox[2]))
    return blocks
```
(This sorts bboxes per color by top row then left col, enabling queue-based "first available" selection; helpful and correct, but may need refinement for multi-block ordering.)

```python
def fill_horizontal_gap(g: List[List[int]], left_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], right_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], fill_col: int, bg: int) -> None:
    min_r = left_bbox[0]
    max_r = left_bbox[1]
    start_c = left_bbox[3] + 1
    end_c = right_bbox[2]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(start_c, end_c):
            if g[r][c] == bg:
                g[r][c] = fill_col

def fill_vertical_gap(g: List[List[int]], up_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], down_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], fill_col: int, bg: int) -> None:
    min_c = up_bbox[2]
    max_c = up_bbox[3]
    start_r = up_bbox[1] + 1
    end_r = down_bbox[0]
    for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
        for r in range(start_r, end_r):
            if g[r][c] == bg:
                g[r][c] = fill_col
```
(These fill straight gaps correctly if bboxes align, using start color; helpful but limited—only works for perfect row/col alignment, misses partial overlaps or non-straight needs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core connection logic is flawed despite good block detection.
 * Ex1 generated: Connected some 1-5 and 1-7 vertically/horizontally in upper sections (e.g., filled 1's around 2/5/7), but missed key horizontal merges like 5-to-7 in rows 2-3 (generated has separate 5's and 7's; expected connects 7's across cols 11-16 with 7 fills), 1-to-3 in rows 9-10 (generated leaves gap; expected fills 3's into col5-6), and bottom 4-to-2 (generated no fill; expected 4's extend to col13-16). Also, row12 has 9's but no connection to prior. Unknown why 7's didn't merge—possibly wrong bbox pairing or alignment check.
 * Ex2 generated: Filled some vertical 1's and 7's (e.g., row6 col2/4/6/8/10/12/14 with 7's? But output shows partial), but missed horizontal extensions like 3 in row4 col6 (expected isolated but connected? Wait, expected has 3 in row4 col6 unchanged, but 5's connect horizontally in row2 col10-12, and 4's connect in row6 col6-8; generated leaves 5's separate at col10 and col12, no 4 merge in row6, and 7's/9's unconnected. Fills overdid some 1's or missed seq order [from legend row11: 2,3,4,6,5,7,9?].
 * Ex3 generated: Detected blocks but minimal fills—e.g., no merges in upper sections (expected connects 3's horizontally in row3 cols3-8, 2's in row3 cols11-15, 9's in row3 cols19-21; generated leaves all separate), lower 4's/6's in row9 cols14-18 unmerged (expected 4's span), and 6's in rows13-17 col11 isolated (expected vertical stack). Also, row20 7's unfilled. Seems to pop wrong blocks from queues, skipping alignments.
 * Overall: Block finding/sorting/legend extraction works (no errors there), but connect_two_blocks fails on non-aligned bboxes (e.g., partial row overlap not handled—fills only full bbox height/width, missing partial gaps) and queue popping assumes strict first-to-first, but seq may require matching closest/aligned blocks, not positional first. No chaining effects (e.g., after connecting A-B, B's new bbox isn't updated for B-C).
 * connect_two_blocks is helpful but broken for partial alignments (e.g., if rows overlap partially, no fill; needs extension to max(min_r, other_min_r) etc.).
 * program overall copies grid correctly and uses queues, but loop only does len(seq)-1 connections without re-finding blocks post-fill, so no iterative merging.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, but fill functions need enhancement for overlap.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills with 2's in many places (e.g., rows 1-5/8-13/15-21 have extensive 2 fills connecting across sections, like row3 col3-8/10-13/21-25, but this merges unrelated blocks and ignores sequence [likely from row26: 4,9,8,9,9,6,4,6,7,6,6,9,9,3,4,3,5,3,3,1,7,... non-1, but 8 is present? Wait, bg=1, legend non-1]. Expected should connect specific pairs like 2-to-4 in upper, but output fills entire rows with 2's, e.g., row16-20 all 2's in cols14-24, which looks like blob expansion rather than targeted gaps. Also, lower row22-25 has 2's filled into what should be isolated, and row27 legend unchanged but 1's overwritten? Misses vertical connections (e.g., 6's/7's in row10/27 unmerged) and creates uniform 2-regions that don't match puzzle's discrete shape extensions. This suggests wrong fill extents or ignoring alignments, making it incoherent for the sequence-based merging.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where numbered cells (2-9 represent colored blocks or regions, 1s are barriers or walls, and 8 is empty background) must be connected or extended into complete shapes based on a sequence extracted from a "key row" (likely the bottom or a specific row with clues). The goal is to fill gaps in background (8) areas between consecutive blocks in the sequence, respecting overlaps in rows/columns and barrier constraints, to form the expected filled regions without altering existing cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The key row is not always the bottom row; it must be identified as the row (starting from bottom) with 3-12 clue cells (2-9) where the number of runs of consecutive clues equals the clue count (i.e., no adjacent clues, suggesting isolated clues).
 * Sequence extraction skips non-clue cells (1s and 8s), creating an ordered list of 2-9 values that dictates connection order (e.g., connect block of seq[0] to seq[1], then seq[1] to seq[2], etc.).
 * Blocks are connected components of the same number (2-9), found via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with 4-directional adjacency); each block is represented by its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * Gaps are filled only between consecutive blocks in the sequence if they "overlap" in the perpendicular dimension: for horizontal gaps (no column overlap, but row overlap), fill vertically separated areas; for vertical gaps (no row overlap, but column overlap), fill horizontally separated areas. Fill only background (8) cells, using the color of the first block (c1).
 * Barriers (1s) block filling and connectivity; blocks cannot cross 1s, and gaps cannot be filled over or through 1s.
 * Background is hardcoded as 8, but in test input, it appears to be 1 in some places (e.g., borders and separators), suggesting 1 might serve dual role as barrier and possible background in unfilled areas— this is a subtlety, as code assumes 8 is fillable bg.
 * Connections may require multiple passes or considering all pairs in sequence, but current code does one pass popping blocks left-to-right, which may mismatch if multiple blocks per color exist or if order is wrong.
 * Subtle: Overlap calculation uses max(0, end - start +1) for rows/columns; if no overlap in one dimension but gap in the other, fill the gap fully in the overlap range, but only if gap_start > gap_end is false (i.e., actual gap exists).
 * Easy to miss: Blocks are sorted by (min_r, min_c) per color, and deques popleft() assumes leftmost/topmost blocks are used first for connections, but this may not match puzzle intent if sequence implies specific pairings (e.g., nearest or spatially logical).
 * No filling if blocks already touch or overlap fully; also, no diagonal connections—only orthogonal.
 * In expectations, some regions extend beyond simple gaps (e.g., in ex1, 7 extends horizontally into what looks like barrier-adjacent areas, and vertically in other places; in ex2, 2 and 5 extend across barriers? Wait, no—looking closely, extensions respect 1s but fill 8s into shapes).
 * Puzzle may involve "stretching" or merging blocks only if they are the "next" in sequence, and unused blocks remain as-is.
 * All changes are non-destructive (deepcopy g, only fill if ==bg).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly identifies isolated-clue rows as keys and extracts sequences accurately (e.g., for ex1, seq likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5], skipping 8s).
 * What worked: Block detection via connected components is solid (preserves existing shapes like the 1-bordered regions); gap-filling logic correctly checks overlaps and only fills bg=8, avoiding overwrites; uses deques for ordered block consumption per color.
 * What didn't work: Fails to connect all required gaps—e.g., in ex1, 7 blocks not extended leftward into col11-13 or rightward fully (generated has isolated 7s in col14-15 row2-3 and col15-16 row2-3? Wait, output shows 7,7,1 in row2 col14-16, but expected has 7s in col11-13 and 15-17 row2-3, plus vertical extensions? Unknown why partial); similarly, 2 in row5-7 col2-3 not connected downward, 3 in row9-10 col1-5 not fully horizontal to col5-6, 4 in row14-15 col8-9 not extended right to col11-14, etc. Differences: Generated leaves many 8s unfilled where expected has color extensions (e.g., row2 col11-13=7, row5 col2-3=2 extended down; row9 col5-6=3; row13 col8-10=9? No, row13 has 9,9 in col8-9 expected but not in generated; generated row13 all 8s except later).
 * In ex2: Minimal filling (only existing blocks), but expected connects 2 horizontally in row2 col3 and col4-5? (generated has 2 only at row2 col2), 3 vertical? No, row4 col2=3 expected but not, 5 in row2 col10 and col12-13 connected; 4 in row6 col6-7 extended right? Differences: Generated ignores most connections, leaving isolated singles (e.g., no 2 at row2 col4, no 3 at row4 col6, no 4 extensions in row6 col8-9, no 5 at row2 col12-13); unknown if block popping order mismatches spatial needs.
 * In ex3: Some vertical stacking in lower blocks (e.g., 6 repeated in rows13-17 col11), but expected has horizontal extensions like 3 in row3 col6-8, 2 in row3 col11-13 and col17? No, and 4 in row9 col14-16, 9 vertical in row6 col19-20? Differences: Generated fills vertically downward for some (e.g., row18-22 all 1-frames with no fills), but misses horizontal merges (e.g., row3: generated has single 3 at col3, single 2 at col11, single 9 at col19; expected has 3x3 at col3-5? Wait row3 col3=3, but extended to col6-8=3; 2 at col11 extended to 13; 9 single but vertical later); also overfills? No, but leaves upper regions unfilled (e.g., row6 all 8s, expected has 9 at col19).
 * Block sorting and popleft() assumes sequential left/top pairing, but may need nearest-block matching or all-pairs checking.
 * find_key_row fallback to h-2 works if bottom is key, but in ex3 (27 cols? rows), it may pick wrong if multiple candidates.
 * No handling for multiple blocks per color in sequence (e.g., two 2s in seq for ex1); pops only one per pair, leaving others unused.
 * deepcopy and main program structure is good, but loop only for i in range(len(seq)-1), assuming one-to-one blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to partially fill some 2-regions (e.g., extending 2s horizontally/vertically within 1-frames in rows1-6,9-13,15-20,21-25? But places singletons like 4 at row3 col3, 8 at row3 col10 (8 is bg, shouldn't place?), 9 at row3 col22, 6 at row10 col3, etc., which seem like misplaced or unconnected clues rather than merged shapes.
 * Issues: Fills large 2 areas but ignores sequence order—bottom row27 seq likely [4,9,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7] (skipping 1s), so should connect 4 to 9 horizontally/vertically in gaps, but generated has scattered singles (e.g., 4 at row16 col14? But no merges; 8 placed erroneously?); upper regions like row15-20 have 2s filled in col14-18 and col20-24, but no color-specific extensions (all 2s, ignoring seq colors); borders are 1s, so bg=1? But code assumes 8, causing no fills where 1 is "bg" (e.g., inner areas unfilled properly). Does not match expected logic, as shapes should be color-specific merges (e.g., connect first 4 block to first 9, filling 1-gaps if possible, but respects 1-barriers); looks like over-reliance on 2-fills (perhaps misidentified key or seq), missing multi-color connections; unknown why singles like 8/9/4 appear without expansion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

The following are obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across all train input/output pairs (and structurally present in test inputs, though unverified without outputs). These focus solely on elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every example, based on changes from input to output. Only properties with direct, repeatable effects (e.g., position influencing addition of new elements, color influencing new element properties) are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., static blue frame shapes without changes, bottom legend colors without positional variance) are excluded unless they enable interactions. No high-level interpretation or full puzzle logic is provided; unknown aspects (e.g., exact pixel scaling factors beyond area) are noted.

#### Components Involved
- **Background Shape**: Large encompassing shape (Maroon in train inputs/outputs, Blue in test inputs; high holes count, full-canvas bbox like [0,0,W,H], high pixels). Affected by additions elsewhere.
- **Frame Shapes**: Medium rectangular shapes (Blue holes=1 in trains, Red or Maroon holes=1 in tests; fixed bboxes like [1,1,4,4] or scaled variants; consistent pixels per size, e.g., 12 for ~4x4 area minus inner). Static but define spatial constraints for interactions.
- **Inner Shapes**: Small colored rectangles (holes=0; colors from palette: Red, Green, Blue/Light Blue, Yellow, Orange, Pink/Maroon, Dark Red/Purple; small bboxes like [2,2,3,3], pixels 1-4; positioned inside frame bboxes).
- **Palette Shapes**: Tiny bottom-row squares (holes=0; 1 pixel each; fixed positions like y=18 or 25, x=odd increments; colors match inners). Define ordering for color-based interactions.
- **Added Shapes** (output-only): New small colored rectangles (holes=0; same colors as inners; bboxes in gaps; pixels vary by gap size). Emerge from interactions.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections
1. **Frame Position → Inner Position Containment**:
   - Inner shapes are always positioned within the bbox of a frame shape (e.g., inner [2,2,3,3] inside frame [1,1,4,4]; scaled in larger examples like [3,3,3,3] inside [1,1,5,5]).
   - Consistent in every input and output: No inners outside frames; frames unchanged, acting as fixed spatial boundaries for potential interactions.
   - Effect: Limits interactions to within/around frame-defined grid (3x3 or irregular in tests); gaps between frames enable new placements.

2. **Palette Position → Inner Color Indexing**:
   - Each inner shape's color is mapped to an index based on its first (or contextually relevant) horizontal position in the palette row (e.g., leftmost Red = index 1, next Green = 2; duplicates like second Red in train 1 treated as separate index ~5 for adjacency checks).
   - Consistent in every example: Palette order (left-to-right x-positions) determines "sequence" for color comparisons; unchanged across input/output.
   - Effect: Colors with adjacent indices (diff = 1, e.g., Green index 2 and Yellow index 3) enable interactions; non-adjacent (diff >1) do not. Unknown: Precise index for duplicate colors (e.g., Red in train 1) when ambiguous, but consistently allows expected additions.

3. **Adjacent Inner Positions + Color Indices → Added Shape Creation**:
   - Horizontally or vertically adjacent inner shapes (sharing row/column via frame grid, e.g., row1 col1 and row1 col2) interact if their color indices differ by exactly 1.
   - Consistent in every train input/output: Additions occur only in such cases (e.g., train 1 row2 Green index 2 + Light Blue index 3 → add; train 2 col3 Orange index 5 + Dark Red index 6 → add; no add for non-diff=1 like Green 2 + Orange 5). Vertical same (e.g., train 2 col2 row1 Green 2 + row2 Yellow 3 → add). Tests show similar adjacencies setup but unverified.
   - Effect: Creates one new added shape per qualifying pair, placed in the spatial gap between the two inners (e.g., x-gap between [3,3] and [8,2,9,3] → new at [5,9,6,10]).

4. **Interacting Color Indices → Added Shape Color**:
   - The added shape takes the color of the interacting pair's smaller (lower) index.
   - Consistent in every train: E.g., train 1 row1 Orange index 7 + Dark Red index 6 → add Dark Red (index 6); train 3 row2 Pink index 5 + Yellow index 4 → add Yellow (index 4); train 2 vertical col3 Orange 5 + Pink 4 → add Pink (4). Applies regardless of left/right or upper/lower position.
   - Effect: Directly transforms color property from pair to new shape; no additions without this index match.

5. **Interacting Positions (Gap) → Added Shape Position and Pixels**:
   - Added shape's bbox exactly fills the gap between the two interacting inners' bboxes (horizontal gap: same y-range, x-span gap; vertical gap: same x-range, y-span gap).
   - Consistent in every train: E.g., train 1 horizontal gap x=11-13 y=2-3 → add [11,2,13,3]; train 3 vertical gap y=12-16 x=11 → add [11,12,11,16]. Pixels = gap width * gap height (e.g., w=3 h=2 → 6; w=1 h=1 → 1; w=3 h=1 → 3).
   - Effect: Position directly determines new bbox; pixels scale with gap dimensions (unknown: exact units for bbox inclusivity, but consistently matches area formula). No additions outside gaps.

6. **Added Shapes (Total Pixels) → Background Pixels**:
   - Background pixels decrease exactly by the sum of all added shapes' pixels (e.g., train 1 adds total 32 pixels → background 264 → 232; train 2 adds total 6 → 181 → 175; train 3 adds total 15 → 573 → 558).
   - Consistent in every train: Reflects background as "remaining canvas fill" after foreground additions; bbox unchanged. Tests show similar large background but unverified change.
   - Effect: Cumulative additions affect background property; no other factors observed influencing this.

7. **Added Shapes (Count) → Background Holes**:
   - Background holes decrease exactly by the number of added shapes created (one per interaction; e.g., train 1: 7 adds → 16 → 9; train 2: 6 adds → 15 → 9; train 3: 5 adds → 12 → 7).
   - Consistent in every train: Each addition "punches" one hole (independent of added pixels/size). Frames' holes=1 remain fixed and do not affect this.
   - Effect: Number of interactions directly reduces background holes; no additions → no change (but all examples have changes).

#### Non-Interactions / Exclusions
- No consistent effects from shape holes (inners/added=0 always; frames=1 static; background holes only passively reduced).
- No interactions involving irrelevant elements (e.g., bottom palette positions unchanged, no self-interaction; no diagonal or non-grid adjacencies trigger adds).
- Color palette unchanged; no feedback from adds to palette.
- Unknown transformations: Why specific duplicate color indices are selected in context (e.g., which Red in train 1); exact canvas total pixels per example (inferred but consistent with subtractions); no observed effects in tests without outputs. No forced explanations for these.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 17:47:40] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid with a background color (typically 1), framed blocks (often color 2) containing inner shapes of various colors (3-9), and a key row (usually near the bottom) providing a sequence of colors that dictates the order in which to connect matching inner shapes. The goal is to draw connections (fills) between consecutive shapes in the sequence using the color of the first shape in each pair, handling both horizontal and vertical gaps while preserving the original grid structure except for these connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is detected as the top-left color; frames are uniform non-background colors surrounding inners within horizontal blocks of at least 2 rows.
 * Inners are extracted as contiguous vertical strips of the same non-background, non-frame color within blocks; they must be grouped by exact x-range and color to form complete shapes.
 * Key row is selected as the lowest row with 3-12 runs of non-background and <=15 non-background cells total; the sequence is the ordered non-background colors in that row (skipping backgrounds).
 * Assignment: Sort available inners by y_start then x_start; greedily assign the leftmost/topmost unused inner matching each sequence color in order (skips if no match, allowing multiples of same color to be used sequentially).
 * Connections: Only between consecutively assigned inners; use first inner's color to fill background gaps. Horizontal: Fill x-gaps in overlapping y-range if gap exists. Vertical: Fill y-gaps in overlapping x-range, but only in fully background ("empty") rows within the gap; if >2 empty rows, fill all; if <=2, fill only the last (bottommost) one—this seems like a heuristic that may miss full paths.
 * Subtleties: No self-connections or loops; connections don't overwrite existing non-background cells; vertical fills are conditional on empty rows to avoid overfilling, but this can leave gaps unfilled if rows aren't fully empty. Inners with height 1 are allowed. Duplicate colors in sequence require multiple matching inners, assigned in spatial order. Fallback key row is h-2 if no suitable row found. Preserve key row unchanged. Blocks ignore single-row non-background strips.
 * Easy to miss: Frame detection uses majority or uniform color per block, but falls back to most common non-bg; may misdetect if mixed. Connections only for assigned pairs, so unassigned inners remain isolated. Horizontal fills are straightforward, but vertical heuristic (partial fill for small gaps) may not create smooth paths in sparse areas.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; no prior versions summarized, but the code builds on standard grid processing.
 * Successfully detects blocks, frames, and inners correctly for training examples (all 3 passed), extracting shapes accurately.
 * Key row detection and sequence extraction work well for trainings, selecting appropriate row and order.
 * Assignment of inners to sequence via spatial sorting (top-left first) works for trainings, handling multiples correctly.
 * Horizontal connections fill gaps properly in overlapping y-ranges, preserving non-bg cells.
 * Vertical connections partially work but use a heuristic (fill all if >2 empty rows, else only last) that succeeds in trainings but may underfill in test.
 * No major misses in omission of single-row blocks or height-1 inners, as trainings passed.
 * Function `find_all_inners` is essential and correct for extracting objects; groups vertical contigs properly.
 * Function `detect_frame_color` is helpful but can fallback to majority, which is fine if uniform in trainings.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though vertical fill logic in main program may need generalization (e.g., always fill all empty rows in gap, not just heuristic).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially connects inners based on the key row sequence (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7), filling some horizontal gaps with matching colors (e.g., row 3 has 4's connecting 2-frame areas around an 8 inner, and a 9 appears isolated but assigned).
 * Vertical connections appear incomplete or selective: e.g., in the middle block (rows ~10-13), a 6 and 7 are present but no clear vertical fills between blocks; lower block (rows ~16-20) shows 9,4,5,3 inners but gaps remain unfilled (e.g., row 15 has isolated 6, not connected upward).
 * Expected: Full path connections forming a continuous line snaking through assigned inners (e.g., connect first 4 (top-left) to 8 below-right with 4-fills, then to 9, etc., filling all bg gaps in horizontal/vertical without the partial vertical rule; key row unchanged, all assigned inners linked in sequence order, unassigned inners untouched).
 * Observed differences: Some fills like extra 4's in row 3 and 9 in row 7/21 are present but seem misplaced (e.g., row 7 has lone 9 not tied to sequence path); vertical gaps (e.g., between row 6 and 8, or 13 and 15) are not filled, leaving disconnected components where a smooth path is expected; bottom block has partial horizontal fills (e.g., row 17 has 9,4,5,3 but no bridging 1's turned to prior color like 5 or 3). This does not fully match expected continuous connections—likely due to vertical heuristic underfilling small gaps and greedy assignment picking wrong inners for duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's/9's, but spatial order may skip intended path). The output makes partial sense (some links visible) but looks incorrect overall, as the path isn't complete/continuous.

[2025-10-02 17:47:40] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 18:07:06] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing a 2D structure like a cave or channel system) with 0s (empty space or background), 1s (walls or barriers), and numbered values representing colored blocks or components. The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, classifying them as "bottom" (near the grid's bottom edge) or "upper" blocks, pairing them by color and position, grouping into channels based on column overlaps, and then modifying the grid (e.g., filling or connecting channels between paired blocks) to produce an output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed by same-color cells (values != 0 and != 1), using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections are not considered.
 * Bottom blocks are specifically those whose maximum row (max_r) reaches n-2 (second-to-last row), suggesting the puzzle treats the very last row (n-1) as a special boundary (e.g., floor or outflow), not part of blocks.
 * Upper blocks are all non-bottom blocks not touching that near-bottom level; this implies a vertical layering where blocks are stacked or separated by rows.
 * Pairing happens by color, sorting both upper and bottom lists by minimum column (min_c) to match left-to-right order; this assumes blocks don't overlap in complex ways and that column position indicates correspondence.
 * Channels are groups of upper blocks whose column ranges overlap (max(min_c) <= min(max_c)), suggesting horizontal "tunnels" or paths; channels are assigned IDs incrementally and sorted internally by min_r (top-to-bottom stacking).
 * The program must return a modified copy of the grid (using deepcopy), but the current implementation doesn't apply any fills/connections—it just identifies structures and returns the unchanged grid, which is incomplete.
 * Subtlety: Block bounds (min_r/max_r, min_c/max_c) are computed via flood-fill (DFS with stack), which correctly handles irregular shapes but assumes colors don't mix (same color only).
 * Grid dimensions: n rows, m columns; assumes rectangular input, no empty rows/columns.
 * Potential misses: No handling for single-cell blocks, multi-block channels with gaps, or colors with unequal upper/bottom counts (pairing takes min length, ignoring extras). No actual grid modification (e.g., filling paths between paired blocks with a specific value like color or 2). Errors arise from undefined 'g' in helper functions (scoping issue: helpers use len(g) but g is only in program(); need to pass grid or use n/m from blocks).
 * All training and test runs failed due to execution errors, so no actual outputs to verify against expected puzzle results (e.g., filled channels or connected paths).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict
from copy import deepcopy
from collections import defaultdict

# Dict for block representation: bounds and color for easy sorting/grouping
Block = Dict[str, any]  # {'min_r': int, 'max_r': int, 'min_c': int, 'max_c': int, 'color': int}

def find_special_blocks(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Block]:
    # Flood-fill to find connected components of same color (!=0, !=1)
    # Uses DFS stack, marks visited, computes bounding box per component
    # Helpful for extracting all special objects; assumes 4-connected, ignores 0/1
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    blocks = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(m):
            if g[r][c] != 1 and g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                min_r, max_r = r, r
                min_c, max_c = c, c
                stack = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                blocks.append({
                    'min_r': min_r, 'max_r': max_r,
                    'min_c': min_c, 'max_c': max_c,
                    'color': color
                })
    return blocks
```

```python
def get_bottom_blocks(g: List[List[int]], blocks: List[Block]) -> List[Block]:
    # Filters blocks touching near-bottom (max_r == n-2); n from len(g)
    # Note: Currently broken due to 'g' scoping; pass n explicitly or compute from blocks
    n = len(g)
    return [b for b in blocks if b['max_r'] == n - 2]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided identifies connected components correctly via flood-fill but fails to execute due to scoping errors ('g' undefined in helpers like get_bottom_blocks, get_upper_blocks, and identify_channels, which reference len(g) without passing g).
 * What worked: find_special_blocks properly extracts blocks with bounds and color; pairing logic (pair_blocks_by_color) sensibly matches by color and sorted columns; channel grouping (identify_channels) handles overlaps via nested loops.
 * What didn't work: No grid modification—returns deepcopy without applying puzzle logic (e.g., filling channels between pairs); all runs (training 1-3, test) errored with "name 'g' is not defined", producing no outputs instead of modified grids. get_bottom_blocks and get_upper_blocks are incomplete/broken (rely on unpassed g; upper_blocks filters vaguely with len(g)-2). pair_blocks_by_color assumes min_c for sorting but ignores block widths (may mispair wide blocks). identify_channels assigns incremental IDs but doesn't use them for output; loop inefficiency for large channels.
 * get_upper_blocks is not helpful (vague filter, broken scoping; better to derive from blocks without g).
 * No training or test outputs generated, so cannot verify if block extraction matches expected (e.g., correct component counts or bounds); differences unknown but likely irrelevant since no modification occurs.
 * Function get_bottom_blocks is partially helpful for bottom detection but broken (fix by passing n); pair_blocks_by_color is useful for matching but may fail on non-singleton blocks (uses min_c only).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("name 'g' is not defined"), not a valid grid; this does not make sense or look correct, as the puzzle requires a modified List[List[int]] output, likely with filled channels or connections (e.g., propagating color from bottom to upper pairs along non-overlapping paths, avoiding walls=1).
 * No actual grid produced, so it mismatches any expected test solution (e.g., if test has specific color flows, nothing is filled); errors prevent checking if block identification is accurate for test input.
 * To handle test case, must fix scoping (pass grid or dimensions to helpers) and implement grid fills (e.g., for each pair, fill vertical/horizontal paths in channels with color or a fill value, respecting 1s as barriers).

[2025-10-02 18:07:06] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.


[2025-10-02 18:19:27] Response:
```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 18:20:32] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where input grids contain partial "shapes" or "blobs" outlined by low numbers (like 1s) with seed values (higher numbers 2-9) inside them, and the task is to complete these shapes by filling entire regions with the seed number, often extending them horizontally or vertically to form consistent rectangular or patterned blocks, while incorporating or propagating elements from a clue row at the bottom (containing isolated numbers 2-9 separated by 8s, which seems to dictate the sequence, position, or mirroring of fills across the grid). The background remains 8, and the output creates a symmetric or mirrored "completed" artwork from the partial input.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are typically bordered by 1s (or sometimes 2s in the test input), enclosing a single or small group of identical higher numbers (e.g., a single 2 inside 1s); these must be expanded to fill the entire bordered region and sometimes beyond into adjacent empty (8) areas to match rectangular patterns (e.g., 1x2, 2x3, or 3x3 blocks), but only in specific directions—horizontal extensions are common within rows, while vertical extensions create stacked identical rows.
 * The bottom clue row (e.g., [8, 2, 8, 3, 8, 9, 8, 4, 8, 2, 8, 6, 8, 7, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8] in train 1 and 2, or a longer variant in train 3) acts as a key: the numbers (2-9) appear to correspond to the seed values that need to be placed or mirrored in upper grid sections, often in a left-to-right order matching their positions, with shapes repeated or mirrored vertically (e.g., top and bottom halves of the grid show similar but not identical patterns).
 * Subtle mirroring or replication: Upper shapes (rows 1-5) are often duplicated or extended downward (e.g., rows 5-7 in train 1 introduce new 2s and 6s that match clue elements), and lower shapes (e.g., rows 13-17) mirror upper ones but with adjustments (e.g., 3s extended leftward in train 1 row 9-10 to include columns 5-6). Empty rows of 8s separate sections, and fills do not cross these.
 * Grid sizes vary (20x20 for train 1/2, ~27x27 for train 3), so solutions must handle variable dimensions; fills stop at grid edges or 8 barriers, and no overfilling into unrelated areas.
 * Clues influence propagation: The sequence in the clue row (e.g., 2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5) seems to map to shape positions—first 2 might fill left-upper, second 2 fills another spot, etc.; in train 3, longer clue [8,3,8,2,8,9,...] leads to more complex extensions like 3x3 blocks for some numbers.
 * Overlaps or interactions: In some cases (e.g., train 1 row 2-3, columns 12-14), a 1-bordered 7 extends rightward into 8s to become three 7s, suggesting rules for "growing" based on clue order or symmetry; no diagonal fills observed—all are orthogonal.
 * Background preservation: All non-shape areas remain 8; 1s (borders) are replaced by the fill number in outputs, indicating borders are temporary and get overwritten.
 * Easy-to-miss: Single-seed shapes (e.g., isolated 4 in train 2 row 6 col 7) extend both horizontally and vertically (becoming 1x3 or more); vertical stacks (e.g., rows 5-7 all identical in train 1) create "pillars" matching clue numbers; test input uses 1s and 2s as mixed borders, suggesting borders can be variable (not always 1), and all-1 top row might be a frame to fill or ignore.
 * No filling across sections: Shapes in upper vs. lower halves are independent but mirrored; clue row itself is unchanged in outputs.
 * Potential errors in partial fills: Inputs have incomplete rows (e.g., train 1 row 2 has 1,2,2,1 but expected fills to match height/width); rule might involve finding connected 1-components and replacing with the max/enclosed number, then extending to match clue positions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions from the previous attempt, as it was a simple identity copy with no logic for shape detection or filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The only attempt was an identity function (def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]: return [row[:] for row in g]), which simply copies the input grid unchanged; this worked for preserving background 8s and exact input positions but failed completely on all transformations needed.
 * Train 1: Generated matches input (partial 1-borders with single 2s/5s/7s/3s/9s/6s, no extensions), but expected fills and extends shapes—e.g., row 2: generated [8,1,2,2,1,8,8,1,5,5,1,8,8,8,1,7,7,1,8,8] vs. expected [8,1,2,2,1,8,8,1,5,5,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,8,8] (missing rightward 7 extension to col 13-14, borders not overwritten); row 5: generated all 8s in cols 2-3/16-17 vs. expected 2s/6s (new vertical pillar shapes introduced/mirrored from clues); row 9: generated [8,1,3,3,1,8,8,1,9,9,1,8,8,8,1,6,6,1,8,8] vs. expected [8,1,3,3,1,3,3,1,9,9,1,8,8,8,1,6,6,1,8,8] (missing leftward 3 extension to cols 5-6); row 13: generated all 8s in cols 8-11/15-18 vs. expected 9s/2s (missing mirrored lower shapes); unknown reason for new pillars in rows 5-7, but clearly not handled.
 * Train 2: Generated matches input (e.g., single 2/3/5/7 in row 2, single 7/4/6/9 in row 6), but expected extends horizontally/vertically—e.g., row 2: generated [8,1,2,1,8,1,3,1,8,1,5,1,8,1,7,1,8,8,8,8] vs. expected [8,1,2,1,2,1,3,1,8,1,5,1,5,1,7,1,8,8,8,8] (missing rightward extensions for 2/5); row 5: generated all 8s in cols 6-7/14-15 vs. expected 3s/7s (new vertical fills from clues); row 6: generated [8,1,7,1,8,1,4,1,8,1,6,1,8,1,9,1,8,8,8,8] vs. expected [8,1,7,1,8,1,4,1,4,1,6,1,8,1,9,1,8,8,8,8] (missing rightward 4 extension); borders remain 1s in generated but are filled over in expected.
 * Train 3: Generated matches input (longer grid with partial 1-borders and seeds like 3/2/9/6/4/7), but expected creates larger blocks—e.g., row 3: generated [8,1,1,3,1,1,8,...1,1,2,1,1,...1,1,9,1,1,...] vs. expected [8,1,1,3,1,1,3,3,3,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,9,1,1,...] (missing 3x3 extensions for 3/2/9); row 6 all 8s in some sections vs. expected 9 in row 6 col 20 (new isolated fill?); rows 13-17: generated partial 6s vs. expected stacked 6s in cols 11-12 (vertical mirroring); row 9: generated [8,8,8,...1,1,6,1,1,...1,1,4,1,1,...] vs. expected [8,8,8,...1,1,6,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,4,1,1,...] (missing 4 extensions); unknown why some seeds like 9 get vertical pillars in rows 13-17 but not others.
 * No functions for blob detection or clue mapping, so attempt couldn't identify or fill shapes; identity function is unhelpful/broken for this problem (don't use it in future—it's just a no-op).
 * All attempts (just this one) ignore clue row influence, leading to missing new shapes (e.g., pillars in empty rows) and no overwriting of 1-borders.
 * Core issue: No recognition of connected components or extension rules, resulting in static output.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is just a copy of the input (identity function), which does not look correct because the input shows partial, unfilled shapes (e.g., row 3: [1,2,2,4,2,2,1,...2,2,9,2,2,1,...] suggests a 2-bordered shape with single 4 and 9 seeds that should be expanded into full blocks of 4s and 9s, possibly 3-wide horizontally like in train examples, and borders overwritten; but generated leaves them partial/singleton). Similarly, row 10: single 6/7/4 seeds inside 2-borders should extend (e.g., to 3x1 or more based on clues), but remain single; row 16: [1,2,2,9,2,2,1,...2,2,5,2,2,1,...2,2,3,2,2,1,...] has multiple single seeds (9,4? wait 4 in row 17? parsing shows partials) that aren't filled, and vertical stacks like rows 15-16 cols 14-18 (2s) aren't extended to match heights in expected patterns. New pillars or mirrors are missing (e.g., potential extensions into all-1 rows 7/13/20, which might be frames to fill with clue numbers like 4/8/9 from bottom row [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]). The bottom clue row in test ([1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]) uses 1s as separators (unlike 8s in training), suggesting a variant where borders are 1s/2s and clues use 1-separators—generated ignores this, leaving no propagation (e.g., no 4/8/9 blocks appearing in upper empty areas). Overall, it looks incomplete and asymmetric, unlike the filled, mirrored expected patterns in training; correct output should have full rectangular fills (e.g., 3x3 for some seeds) and vertical repetitions matching clue sequence.

[2025-10-02 18:20:32] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where input grids contain partial "shapes" or "blobs" outlined by low numbers (like 1s) with seed values (higher numbers 2-9) inside them, and the task is to complete these shapes by filling entire regions with the seed number, often extending them horizontally or vertically to form consistent rectangular or patterned blocks, while incorporating or propagating elements from a clue row at the bottom (containing isolated numbers 2-9 separated by 8s, which seems to dictate the sequence, position, or mirroring of fills across the grid). The background remains 8, and the output creates a symmetric or mirrored "completed" artwork from the partial input.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are typically bordered by 1s (or sometimes 2s in the test input), enclosing a single or small group of identical higher numbers (e.g., a single 2 inside 1s); these must be expanded to fill the entire bordered region and sometimes beyond into adjacent empty (8) areas to match rectangular patterns (e.g., 1x2, 2x3, or 3x3 blocks), but only in specific directions—horizontal extensions are common within rows, while vertical extensions create stacked identical rows.
 * The bottom clue row (e.g., [8, 2, 8, 3, 8, 9, 8, 4, 8, 2, 8, 6, 8, 7, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8] in train 1 and 2, or a longer variant in train 3) acts as a key: the numbers (2-9) appear to correspond to the seed values that need to be placed or mirrored in upper grid sections, often in a left-to-right order matching their positions, with shapes repeated or mirrored vertically (e.g., top and bottom halves of the grid show similar but not identical patterns).
 * Subtle mirroring or replication: Upper shapes (rows 1-5) are often duplicated or extended downward (e.g., rows 5-7 in train 1 introduce new 2s and 6s that match clue elements), and lower shapes (e.g., rows 13-17) mirror upper ones but with adjustments (e.g., 3s extended leftward in train 1 row 9-10 to include columns 5-6). Empty rows of 8s separate sections, and fills do not cross these.
 * Grid sizes vary (20x20 for train 1/2, ~27x27 for train 3), so solutions must handle variable dimensions; fills stop at grid edges or 8 barriers, and no overfilling into unrelated areas.
 * Clues influence propagation: The sequence in the clue row (e.g., 2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5) seems to map to shape positions—first 2 might fill left-upper, second 2 fills another spot, etc.; in train 3, longer clue [8,3,8,2,8,9,...] leads to more complex extensions like 3x3 blocks for some numbers.
 * Overlaps or interactions: In some cases (e.g., train 1 row 2-3, columns 12-14), a 1-bordered 7 extends rightward into 8s to become three 7s, suggesting rules for "growing" based on clue order or symmetry; no diagonal fills observed—all are orthogonal.
 * Background preservation: All non-shape areas remain 8; 1s (borders) are replaced by the fill number in outputs, indicating borders are temporary and get overwritten.
 * Easy-to-miss: Single-seed shapes (e.g., isolated 4 in train 2 row 6 col 7) extend both horizontally and vertically (becoming 1x3 or more); vertical stacks (e.g., rows 5-7 all identical in train 1) create "pillars" matching clue numbers; test input uses 1s and 2s as mixed borders, suggesting borders can be variable (not always 1), and all-1 top row might be a frame to fill or ignore.
 * No filling across sections: Shapes in upper vs. lower halves are independent but mirrored; clue row itself is unchanged in outputs.
 * Potential errors in partial fills: Inputs have incomplete rows (e.g., train 1 row 2 has 1,2,2,1 but expected fills to match height/width); rule might involve finding connected 1-components and replacing with the max/enclosed number, then extending to match clue positions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions from the previous attempt, as it was a simple identity copy with no logic for shape detection or filling.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style polyomino puzzle on a grid, where 1s represent walls or barriers, 8s are background/empty space, and scattered numbers (2-9) in the grid and possibly a clue row at the bottom indicate the required size of connected polyomino regions (orthogonally adjacent cells of the same number must form exactly N cells for a clue N). The task is to resolve and fill ambiguous or partial regions by expanding/connecting same-number cells into complete polyominoes of the exact size, without overlapping walls or background, while leaving walls, background, and the clue row unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are bounded by 1s (walls) and 8s (background); fillings must stay within these enclosures and cannot cross them—treat 1s and 8s as impassable.
 * Each number N must form exactly one or more polyominoes of size exactly N; cells with the same N must connect orthogonally (up/down/left/right, no diagonals) to form these shapes, and no polyomino can be larger or smaller than N.
 * Partial clues (single N cells) need to be expanded by claiming adjacent empty cells (non-1, non-8) to reach size N; if multiple possible expansions, resolve based on fitting all clues without conflict (e.g., don't overclaim space needed for another number).
 * The bottom row (e.g., [8, 2, 8, 3, ...]) acts as a fixed clue legend or seed row—do not modify it; it provides initial N placements that must be expanded upward into the grid.
 * Subtle: Some regions may have multiple clues of the same N, requiring multiple separate polyominoes of size N; avoid merging different Ns or same N across walls. Empty regions without clues might remain 8s or need inference from fitting.
 * Overlapping possibilities: If a region has space for multiple polyominoes, prioritize exact fits; e.g., a clue 7 in a larger space might need to snake or L-shape to fill exactly 7 cells without leaving orphans.
 * Edge cases: Thin corridors (e.g., 1-cell wide) limit shapes; vertical/horizontal stretches must match sizes (e.g., a 2x2 block for 4, not a 1x4 line if it doesn't fit clues). Background 8s in regions might be "empty" but can be filled if needed for polyominoes.
 * All training examples show the bottom clue row unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming it's fixed. Grids vary in width (20, 20, 27 cols across examples), so handle variable dimensions.
 * No diagonals for connectivity; only 4-directional adjacency.
 * If a region has no clues, leave as 8s; if overconstrained (impossible fit), but assuming inputs are solvable.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single prior program used flood-fill on non-background/non-wall cells to identify components, then applied rules like filling with "minority color" if no 1s or filling non-1 cells with the other color if 1s present—but this misinterprets the puzzle as color-based merging rather than size-constrained polyomino expansion.
 * Worked: Correctly detected some connected components (e.g., in Train 1, it kept existing 2s,5s,7s in place without overwriting clues); identified walls (1s) and background (8s) accurately; preserved the bottom clue row unchanged.
 * Didn't work: Ignored polyomino size rules entirely—e.g., filled entire components with one number regardless of size (overfilling 7s as just two cells instead of expanding to seven); treated 1s as "walls to fill around" but didn't use them as boundaries for exact N-shapes; minority/majority logic led to arbitrary fills (e.g., Train 1 row 2 kept 7s as two cells, missing extension to [7,7,7,7,7,7? wait no, expected has three 7s in middle and three on right, but generated only two each).
 * Train 1 differences: Generated missed vertical extensions (e.g., rows 6-8 should have 2s in cols 2-3 and 6s in cols 16-17, but output has all 8s there); row 10 has 3s only in two cells but expected extends to six 3s (cols 1-6); row 14 all 8s/1s but expected has 9s in cols 8-9 and 2s in 16-17; unknown why it didn't expand from bottom clues upward.
 * Train 2 differences: Generated left many areas as 1s or unchanged, e.g., row 2 has 2 and 3 isolated but expected connects 2s across (cols 2 and 4); row 4 all 8s but expected has 3 in col 6; row 6 has 7 and 4 isolated but expected connects 4s (cols 6-8? wait, cols 6 and 8 for 4); row 5 has 3 in col 6 but generated empty; failed to expand bottom clues (e.g., 3,4,6 into vertical polyominoes).
 * Train 3 differences: Similar isolation issues—e.g., row 3 has 3,2,9 as singles but expected expands 3 to cols 3-6 (four 3s?), 2 to cols 11-15 (five 2s?), 9 unchanged? Wait, expected has 3s in 3-6 and 3s in 7-9? No, row 3 expected: 3 at col3, then 1s, but actually expands horizontally/vertically; generated missed most expansions (e.g., row 9 has 6 and 4 isolated, expected connects 6s? and 4s in cols 14-18); rows 13-17 all 8s/6? but generated empty, expected has vertical 6s in col11; bottom expansions ignored entirely.
 * extract_regions (from the program) is helpful for finding bounded areas but broken for polyomino logic—needs integration with clue sizes (don't use raw minority fill). No other functions in the attempt; color_count logic is unhelpful/irrelevant (puzzle isn't about colors, but numbers as sizes—discard it).
 * Overall: Attempt shows basic component detection but zero grasp of Fillomino rules (no size enforcement, no expansion from clues), leading to underfilled grids; bottom clues not propagated upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills large rectangular blocks without respecting polyomino sizes (e.g., rows 1-6 have a 5x6 block of 4s, which is 30 cells, but if seeded from a single 4 clue, it should be exactly 4 cells, not 30; similarly, 5-row 9s block is 25 cells, way over size 9). 
 * It treats entire row-spanning areas as single fills (e.g., cols 8-12 as 8s across multiple rows, but 8 is background—should not fill with 8 if claiming for polyominoes; expected likely has smaller, connected shapes like 4-cell 4s snaking around 1s). 
 * Bottom row clues (e.g., 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) are unchanged (good), but no upward expansion visible (e.g., col1 has 4 in bottom, but above it rows 15-20 have 9s/4s/5s/3s, not connected to bottom 4). 
 * Borders of 1s are preserved, but inner empties (implied 8s?) are wrongly uniform-filled, ignoring exact N sizes—e.g., a 5x5 block of 5s would be 25 cells, not size 5; this mismatches Fillomino, where shapes must be exactly N connected cells per clue. 
 * Unknown why it filled with 8s in some blocks (e.g., cols 8-12), as 8 is background—perhaps mistaking empty regions, but expected should fill with numbers from nearby clues or leave empty only if no fit. Overall, it looks like crude region painting, not size-aware polyominoes; to fix, start from each clue position and grow exactly N cells using BFS/possible shapes, resolving conflicts by backtracking or deduction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a 2D array of integers representing colors or fills (1 likely as background/white, 2+ as colored regions, 8 as unknowns/blanks to be resolved, and other numbers like 3-9 as special markers or obstacles). The goal is to transform the grid by applying rules to fill or adjust 8's and possibly other elements based on patterns like bounded regions or connections, ensuring consistency across rows and potentially columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 8's should be filled only if they form internal sequences bounded by the same non-8 color (e.g., >1) on both sides within a row, treating them as part of an extending colored region; however, boundaries must handle edges carefully to avoid assuming a default color like 0.
 * Index bounds are critical: when scanning for left/right non-8 bounds around 8-sequences, the code must prevent out-of-range access (e.g., l < 0 or r >= n), which caused crashes; use safe checks like if l >= 0 before accessing row[l].
 * The puzzle likely involves row-wise processing first, but may require column-wise or global consistency checks, as the grid shows symmetric or repeating patterns (e.g., 2-regions with embedded numbers like 4,6,9 that might act as "seeds" or fixed points not to overwrite).
 * Subtle elements: Embedded numbers (3-9) in colored regions (e.g., 2's) should remain unchanged unless rules specify merging; all-1 rows suggest background filling, but over-filling (e.g., turning everything to 1) ignores colored blobs. 8's might only fill if bounds are strictly same and non-background (not 1). Training errors indicate the need for robust edge cases, like 8's at row starts/ends or isolated 8's.
 * Global considerations: The grid has vertical symmetry and repeating 2-blob structures with varying embedded numbers (e.g., row 3 has 4 and 9 in 2's, row 10 has 6,7,4,9); rules might propagate fills vertically or match patterns across the grid. Deepcopy is useful to avoid mutating input, but ensure the function returns a modified copy.
 * Potential misses: Not handling cases where 8's are adjacent to 1's (background) without a matching bound; ignoring vertical influences (e.g., 8 in row 4 might align with patterns above/below); assuming left_c/right_c >1 without verifying they are actual colors (1 might be invalid for filling).

```
(Note: This function is conceptually helpful for row-wise 8-filling but is currently broken due to potential index errors in bound finding; it could be fixed with better sentinels or conditional access. No other types/tools from attempts, as this is the primary one.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on filling internal 8-sequences in rows bounded by matching colors >1, which aligns with a core rule for resolving blanks in colored regions.
 * What worked: Successfully deepcopy'd the grid to avoid mutation; generated a partial output for the test input without crashing it (unlike training); correctly skipped non-8 cells and identified sequences.
 * What didn't work: Caused "list assignment index out of range" errors in all three training examples, likely due to unsafe access when l < 0 or r >= n during bound finding (e.g., row[l] or row[r] without checks); in test, it failed to fill the 8 in row 4 (position 3: [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]) because left bound (1) != right bound (1? but interrupted by 9), leaving 8 unchanged and not propagating any fills; over-filled some rows to all 1's? Wait, no—the output shows mostly unchanged rows with 8 intact, suggesting the filling condition never triggered properly.
 * The program function simply wraps the fill_eights, which is minimal but doesn't address vertical or multi-pass rules, missing broader puzzle elements like connecting 2-blobs vertically.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., blobs or regions) was attempted, which might be essential for identifying bounded areas globally; this attempt assumes purely row-local rules, ignoring potential column interactions.
 * Training mismatches: All errored out, so no validation; unknown why index errors occurred (possibly training grids have 8's at edges without sentinels), but it demonstrates lack of robustness.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It largely mirrors the input grid (assuming standard input has similar structure), with the 8 in row 4 (0-indexed) remaining unfilled (output shows [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]), and embedded numbers like 9,4,7 unchanged, but no evident filling of 8's despite the rule intent—suggesting the bounding condition failed (left of 8 is 1, right is 1 but with 9 nearby, possibly not matching strictly).
 * Many rows are output as repeating 1's or partial 2-blobs (e.g., row 1: [1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,...] unchanged), which might be correct if no 8's to fill, but the all-1 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,7) look like background preservation; however, later rows like 15-19 show 2-blobs with embedded 9,4,5,3 which remain, indicating no overwriting happened.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should resolve the 8 to match surrounding pattern (e.g., fill to 1 or extend a color, but based on rules, possibly to 4 if bounded by 4's—though here bounds are 1's); instead, 8 persists, and no vertical consistency (e.g., row 27 mirrors row 4 with 8 and 9's unfilled). This doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as 8's are unresolved blanks; it seems like the code ran but skipped filling due to mismatched bounds or bugs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a Fillomino-style logic puzzle where a grid (with 8s representing empty/unfilled cells, 1s likely acting as boundaries, dividers, or pre-filled non-polyomino cells, and scattered numbers 2-9 as given clues in the bottom row) must be filled such that groups of identical numbers form orthogonally connected polyominoes exactly matching the number's value (e.g., three 3's connected together). The program attempts to automate filling by propagating numbers horizontally into sequences of 8s based on nearby clues or bounds, but it ignores vertical connections, full polyomino validation, and multi-step deduction.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Polyominoes must be exactly the size of the number (e.g., a 5 requires exactly five connected 5's; no more, no less), and same-number polyominoes cannot touch orthogonally even if separate groups.
 * 8s are empty cells to be filled; 1s appear to serve as fixed boundaries or walls that cannot be part of polyominoes (they block horizontal/vertical propagation and remain 1s in outputs).
 * Clues (2-9) are given primarily in the bottom row, separated by 8s, but fillings can extend vertically into upper rows; horizontal-only filling misses cases where polyominoes span rows (e.g., vertical stacks like three 2's in rows 5-7 of train1 expected output).
 * Deduction often requires looking beyond immediate bounds: if a sequence of 8s is bounded by 1s, the fill number comes from the nearest clue (left or right), but only if the sequence length matches or can connect to form the exact polyomino size; over-filling (e.g., assigning a number to a sequence longer/shorter than needed) breaks the rule.
 * Subtle: Some regions remain 8s if they are not part of any clue-based polyomino (e.g., isolated 8s between groups in train1 row2 positions 5-6 stay 8, not filled with 5). Propagation must consider both directions and avoid assuming all 8-sequences are fillable—some are "gaps" between polyominoes.
 * The bottom row (clues) is untouchable (skipped in processing), and the puzzle assumes orthogonal (up/down/left/right) connectivity only—no diagonals.
 * Edge cases: Single-cell clues (rare, but if length=1 bounded by 1s, it may copy the nearest clue directly); long 1-sequences may indicate separate regions; vertical priority over horizontal in conflicts (e.g., train1 rows 5-7 fill vertically with 2's and 6's despite horizontal 8s).
 * All attempts fail to validate polyomino sizes post-filling (e.g., no check if a filled group actually connects to exactly N cells), leading to overfills or wrong numbers.
 * Grids vary in size (20x20 for train1/2, 27x27 for train3), so dimension handling is key, but processing only upper rows (skipping bottom) is correct but insufficient without vertical logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
```
(This is a simple, correct utility for getting grid height/width; useful for iteration bounds.)

The main `program` function is an attempt at filling logic but is broken overall (see below); it correctly identifies horizontal 8-sequences but fails on number selection and vertical integration. No other helper functions are provided, but a potential useful addition could be a function to find nearest clue horizontally/vertically:
```python
def find_nearest_clue(g: List[List[int]], row: int, col: int, direction: str) -> int:
    # Example stub: search left/right/up/down from (row, col) for first 2-9, skipping 1s and 8s
    # Return 0 if none found
    pass
```
(This is conceptual; not in the attempt but would help for better propagation than the attempt's buggy left/right search.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and skips the bottom clue row, uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, and properly detects horizontal sequences of 8s bounded by non-8s (e.g., correctly fills the two 2's in train1 row2/3 bounded by 1s, matching expected).
 * It works for simple cases where a horizontal 8-sequence is directly bounded by matching clues >1 (e.g., partial matches in train1 for 7's in row2/3), and sometimes picks the right number from left/right when bounded by 1s (e.g., 3's in train9/10).
 * However, it fails to handle vertical propagation entirely—no code for checking/connecting across rows, leading to misses like the vertical 2's and 6's in train1 rows5-7 (generated keeps 8s, expected fills them) and vertical 6's in train3 rows13-17 (generated all 8s, expected 6's in col11).
 * Bug in bound detection: The left/right bound finding loops incorrectly extend bounds if adjacent 8s (e.g., in train1 row2, it over-extends left/right for the 5-clue area, filling positions 5-6 with 5's where expected 8,8 as a gap).
 * Flawed 1-bounded logic: When bounded by 1s, it prefers left clue but only if left 1-sequence length==1, else right— this is arbitrary and wrong (e.g., in train1 row9, it picks 9 for a sequence that should be 3 from left, and fills 6's correctly but in wrong spot; in train2 row2, it leaves 3's as 1's instead of filling adjacent 8? Wait, input unclear but generated has 1,2,1,2 instead of expected 1,2,1,2 but misses later 3/8).
 * In train3, it fills upper horizontal groups (e.g., 3's and 2's in row3) but completely ignores lower vertical stacks (e.g., expected 6's in rows13-17 col11 stay 8s; expected 4's in row9 col14-16 become wrong 6,1,1 or similar—mismatch in positioning).
 * Over-filling issue: Fills sequences longer than the clue (e.g., train1 row9 fills four 9's? but clue is 9, yet expected uses 3's instead, suggesting vertical or size mismatch not checked).
 * The while-loop for sequence detection skips non-8 cells correctly but doesn't revisit after filling (no iterative propagation), so partial fills don't trigger further changes (e.g., train2 misses filling after initial 8's to 3/4).
 * Function `program` is partially helpful for horizontal detection but broken for full solving (don't reuse without vertical logic and validation); the inner left/right clue search is unhelpful/buggy as it skips 1s but doesn't search vertically or validate size.
 * All training examples incorrect: Train1 mismatches in filled gaps (e.g., extra 5's/9's where 8's/3's expected) and misses verticals; Train2 mismatches in partial horizontals (e.g., generated 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,3 but expected 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,8 and vertical 3/4/6/7/9 in row4/6); Train3 mismatches in verticals (e.g., no 6's or 4's in lower rows) and some horizontals (e.g., row9 has 6,1,1,6,6,6 but expected 6,1,1,4,4,4).
 * Unknown reasons for some mismatches (e.g., why train1 row10 fills 8,8,8 with 6's correctly but row9 overfills 9's—possibly bound detection error in while l >=0 and g[i][l]==8).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-fills nearly the entire grid with groups of five 2's (e.g., rows2-6 have long horizontal 2,2,2,2,2 sequences bounded by 1s), but this ignores clue sizes in the bottom row (e.g., clues like 4,9,4,7,6,9 require exact polyominoes of those sizes, not all 2's; a group of five 2's would need to be part of ten 2's total for validity, but no such connection exists).
 * It treats borders as all 1s (e.g., row0 all 1s, many rows starting/ending with 1s), suggesting the input had 8s replaced indiscriminately, but expected should leave gaps as 1s or 8s and form vertical/horizontal polyominoes matching bottom clues (e.g., a 9-clue should have nine connected 9's spanning rows, not scattered 2's or 9's in single positions like row3 col22).
 * Wrong numbers in key spots: e.g., row17 has 2,2,9,2,2 but a 9 should connect to eight more 9's (not isolated); row18 has scattered higher numbers (9,4,2,2,5,2,2,3,2,2) that don't form valid polyominoes (e.g., single 9 can't be valid). This indicates the horizontal-only logic failed on a larger/wider grid (29 cols?), creating artificial 1-boundaries and ignoring vertical needs.
 * To handle test, must add vertical search/propagation and size validation (e.g., after filling a group, count connected same-number cells == number value).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style logic puzzle on a grid with walls (cells marked 1, which block regions), clue cells (numbers 2-9 indicating the exact size of the connected region that cell belongs to), and empty cells (marked 8, to be filled with numbers 2-9 such that all connected cells sharing the same number form a polyomino of exactly that size, without crossing walls or clues mismatched to their regions). The goal is to deduce and fill all 8s logically based on clues and constraints, ensuring no region violates size rules, clues are satisfied, and the grid is fully resolved without isolated cells or overflows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (1s) act as barriers; regions cannot connect across or include 1s, and 1s themselves are not part of any numbered region.
 * Clues (2-9) must be the starting point for a region of exactly that many connected cells ( orthogonally adjacent, no diagonals), all filled with the same number as the clue; no two different clues can be in the same region unless they match in value and size constraints.
 * Empty cells (8s) must be filled to extend regions logically; single-cell regions are impossible since clues start at 2, so all 8s must connect to existing clues or form new regions only if deducible (but typically all connect back to clues).
 * Horizontal and vertical fillings must consider adjacent clues and skipped walls (1s between sequences of 8s), but cannot assume fills without verifying total region size; over-filling (e.g., long chains of the same number exceeding the clue value) violates rules.
 * Special cases for all-8 rows: These may need targeted filling based on bottom clues (e.g., if a specific clue like bottom[13]==9 triggers patterns), but must avoid assuming offsets without bounds checking; even/odd indexing for offsets risks skipping or duplicating fills.
 * Subtle deduction rules: When 8s are bounded by clues on left/right (or up/down), fill with the matching clue if sizes align (e.g., equal clues with no/minimal skipped 1s); if unequal, prefer the closer/bounding clue or use length of 8s sequence to decide (e.g., short sequences like length=1 or 2 favor smaller/nearer clues, but only if total region won't exceed); symmetric cases (equal skipped 1s) require checking sequence length against clue (e.g., length=3 with 1 skipped might take max/min based on puzzle norms).
 * Avoid naive fills: Do not fill entire sequences of 8s with a single number without counting total connected cells (including vertical/horizontal extensions); this can create oversized regions (e.g., five 2s in a row is invalid for size 2).
 * Grid structure: Clues often in bottom/top rows separated by 1s; upper grid has blocks of 1s (solid walls) and open areas with 8s; fills must propagate across rows/columns without leaving isolated 8s.
 * Edge cases: Zero skipped 1s allows direct propagation from one side; multiple skipped 1s (e.g., 1 or 2) may block or weight toward one clue; clues like 9 may indicate large regions spanning multiple rows.
 * Full resolution: Program must iterate fills (horizontal then vertical, possibly multiple passes) until no 8s remain; partial fills (leftover 8s) indicate incomplete logic.
 * No diagonals or wrapping; regions are strictly orthogonal polyominoes.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `fill_all8_rows`: Broken due to index out of range errors (e.g., accessing offset_cols[ii-1] when ii exceeds len(offset_cols), or assuming fixed indices like g[h-2][13]==9 without grid validation); overly specific to unconfirmed patterns (e.g., even/odd ii for offsets +3 from clues); does not generally help deduce regions and causes crashes—remove or heavily refactor.
 * No region size validation function: All attempts lack a post-fill check to ensure no region exceeds its number (critical flaw); without this, fills are speculative and invalid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (no prior ones detailed) focused on horizontal/vertical filling of 8 sequences bounded by clues, with heuristics for unequal clues (prefer nearer/bounding, adjust by skipped 1s and sequence length) and special all-8 row handling, but failed entirely on training examples due to index errors in `fill_all8_rows` (out of range on offset_cols and fixed [13] access, likely from assuming clue positions without bounds checks).
 * What worked: For the test input, it successfully ran without error and filled many 8s into 2s (e.g., horizontal stretches of five 2s in multiple rows, like rows 1-5 and 8-11), and placed some higher numbers (e.g., 4 at [3][3], 9 at [3][22], 6 at [10][3], 7 at [10][10], 4 at [10][22], 9 at [11][22], 2s extended in lower sections like rows 15-20 with added 9/4/5/3 placements); this shows basic detection of 8 sequences and clue propagation for small/default fills (2s as fallback?).
 * What didn't work: Training examples 1-3 all crashed with "list assignment index out of range" (likely in `fill_all8_rows` when computing/iterating offset_cols or accessing g[h-2][13] on smaller/variable grids); no training passes, indicating non-robust code. For test, filling is incomplete (e.g., row 27 still has an 8 at position 3), and logic is flawed—long horizontal 2-runs (e.g., five connected 2s in row 1 cols 1-5) create invalid regions (size 5 > 2, violating Fillomino rules); vertical connections (e.g., stacked 2s across rows 1-5 in col 1) would compound to even larger invalid regions. Heuristics for fill_n (e.g., taking max/min for length=3 with skipped=1, or preferring left if skipped_left < skipped_right) are ad-hoc and over-aggressive, ignoring total region size; symmetric cases (equal clues/skipped) have inconsistent rules (e.g., min vs max in vertical vs horizontal). No iteration for propagating fills across directions, leaving deductions partial. `fill_all8_rows` contributed nothing useful here (no all-8 rows filled specially, and it may have skipped due to conditions like g[h-2][13]==9 not met).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates partial grasp of bounding clues and sequence filling but misses core region validation, leading to invalid outputs; errors prevent any training success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially filled the grid (e.g., upper blocks like rows 1-6 and 8-13 have patterns of 1s separating stretches of five 2s, with isolated higher numbers like 4/9/6/7 inserted; lower sections rows 15-20 mirror this with 2s and 5/3/9/4; solid 1-rows at 0,6-7,13-14,20-21,25-26,28 act as barriers) but does not look correct overall.
 * Issues: Many 2-fills create oversized regions (e.g., row 1: 2s at cols 1-5 connect horizontally to size 5 >2; vertically, col 1 has 2s in rows 1-5,8-11,15-20 stacking to size 15+ >2, invalid); this suggests the program defaulted to 2s for unknown/bounded 8s without size checks. Higher placements (e.g., 9 at row 3 col 22, 5 at row 17 col 16) might align with nearby clues (bottom row has 9s/5s), but without full connectivity check, they could be wrong (e.g., if the 9-region doesn't reach size 9). Incomplete: Row 27 retains an 8 (at col 3, between 4 and 1,9 clues), meaning deduction failed there—likely needs vertical propagation from above or better bounding logic. Expected output should have no 8s left, all regions exactly matching their number (e.g., 2s only in isolated domino pairs, 9s in nonominoes connecting to clue positions), and no overflows; this output violates that by over-filling 2s and leaving gaps, so it mismatches a correct resolution (difference likely due to lack of region counting and multi-pass deduction).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a region-filling puzzle on a grid where 1's serve as impassable boundaries (walls), 8's are empty cells to be filled, and clue numbers (2-9) are seeds placed within regions; the goal is to identify each connected region (4-way adjacent non-1 cells) bounded by 1's or grid edges, and fill all 8's in that region with the single clue number (2-9) present in it, leaving single-cell regions (like bottom-row clues separated by 8's) unchanged except for their clue.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) groups of 8's and exactly one clue per region; filling must propagate the clue to all connected 8's within the boundaries, even for non-rectangular or L-shaped regions spanning multiple rows/columns.
 * 1's block propagation entirely and are never changed; 8's on the grid edges or outside regions may remain 8's if not part of a fillable region.
 * Bottom row typically contains isolated single-cell regions with clues (2-9) separated by 8's, which stay as-is (clue in place, adjacent 8's unfilled since they may be boundaries or separate).
 * Assume exactly one clue (2-9) per region; no overwriting of existing clues or handling multiple clues per region (puzzle validity assumes this).
 * Propagation must handle vertical, horizontal, and turning connections (e.g., a clue in one row filling adjacent columns in another row); straight-line run filling alone misses complex shapes.
 * Iterative passes (horiz then vert) can approximate propagation but fail if not checking connectivity fully, as runs may not align with region bounds (e.g., bounded by 1's instead of matching clues).
 * Unfilled 8's in generated outputs often indicate missed vertical propagation or regions bounded by 1's (not same >1 clues).
 * Clues like 2-9 in bottom row do not propagate upward unless connected through a region (rarely, as they are isolated).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 20x20 in ex1-2, 27x27? in ex3), with borders often all-8 rows/columns that remain 8's.
 * Subtle: Some regions span multiple rows but are vertically bounded by 1's (e.g., rows 2-3 only), so no spillover to adjacent all-8 rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The previous attempt's `get_dimensions` is useful for getting grid size. No other functions from the attempt are helpful, as the core logic (run-based filling) is flawed for regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt used iterative (20 passes) horizontal and vertical run-filling: finds consecutive 8's in a row/column, extends to find bounding cells, and fills the run only if bounds are identical numbers >1; this worked partially for straight horizontal runs adjacent to clues >1 (e.g., ex1 row2 cols2-3 filled as 2,2; cols8-9 as 5,5; cols15-16 as 7,7; ex2 row2 col2=2 single; ex3 row3 col3=3 single, col11=2 single).
 * Failed completely for regions bounded by 1's (not >1 clues), leaving runs of 8's unfilled (e.g., ex1 row2 cols11-13 stayed 8,8,8 instead of 7,7,7 from a nearby 7 clue in the same row-bounded region; ex3 row3 cols6-8 stayed 1,1,1? but expected 3,3,3 from horizontal propagation within 1-bounded region).
 * Missed all vertical propagation into all-8 areas adjacent to filled rows (e.g., ex1 rows5-7 cols2-3 stayed 8's instead of 2,2; rows5-7 cols15-16 stayed 8's instead of 6,6; ex2 row4 col2 stayed 8 instead of 3; row6 col4-5 stayed 1,4,1? but expected 4,4 from vertical; ex3 rows13-17 col11 stayed 8's? but expected 6's vertically).
 * Did not handle region connectivity across turns/corners (e.g., ex1 row9 cols5-6=3,3 filled horizontally, but if vertically connected, would miss; ex3 row9 cols16-18=4,4,4 expected but gen missed vertical from row10? gen row10 has 1,1,6,1,1 but no full fill).
 * Bottom row clues stayed correctly unfilled around them (e.g., all examples kept isolated 2-9 with surrounding 8's as 8's), as bounds were 8's or edges (condition left_c == right_c >1 not met).
 * Worked for some isolated singles (e.g., ex2 row2 col6=3; ex3 row3 col20=9), but over-relied on bounds matching clues, ignoring 1-bounded regions.
 * Function `fill_horizontal` and `fill_vertical` are broken for this puzzle: they only fill straight runs bounded by matching >1 clues, useless for 1-bounded or multi-direction regions (do not use in future; replace with flood fill).
 * `program` iteration helped propagate some chained horizontal fills but stalled on vertical or bounded cases (e.g., ex1 filled initial 2's/5's/7's but no further).
 * Ex1: Generated mismatched 7's (cols11-13 row2-3=8's vs expected 7's; cols13 row2=8 vs 7; vertical 2's/6's in rows5-7=8's vs expected filled; row9 cols5-6=3,3 correct but row10 cols5-6=3,3 correct? wait gen row10=1,3,3,1 correct; row13 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 9,9?; row14 cols15-16=2,2 correct but reason unknown).
 * Ex2: Mismatched vertical fills (row4 col2=8 vs 3; row4 col10=8 vs 6; row4 col14=8 vs 7; row6 cols4-5=1,4,1? gen 1,4,1 but expected 4,4 vertical from row6 col4=4 seed?; row2 col4=8 vs 2).
 * Ex3: Mismatched horizontal extensions in 1-bounded regions (row3 cols3=3 single vs extended 3's at cols6-8; row9 cols16-18=1,1,1? vs 4,4,4; vertical 6's in rows13-17 col11=8's vs expected 6's; row6 col20=8 vs 9; row18-22 cols20-22=8's vs 7?).
 * `deepcopy` is helpful to avoid mutating input but irrelevant to core logic failure.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrated partial understanding of line-filling but zero grasp of full region flood fill, leading to all training failures; no extraction functions present, but one could be added for regions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows excessive horizontal filling with 2's in long runs bounded by 1's (e.g., row1 cols1-5=2's, row3 cols1-3=2's and cols5-6=2's around a 4 seed without overwriting or unifying the region, row10 cols1-5=2's, row16 cols1-5=2's and cols14-18=2's around 2's but with 5 at col16, row18 cols1-3=2's around 9/4 but kept separate), which suggests the run-filling logic applied blindly without checking region clues or vertical connections.
 * It preserves seeds like 4 (row3 col3), 9 (row3 col22), 6 (row10 col3), 7 (row10 col11), but fills adjacent 8's with 2's incorrectly if those seeds define different regions (e.g., row3 has 4 and 9 isolated but surrounded by 2-fills, implying wrong clue propagation; likely the 2's come from nearby seeds, but verticals like row16-17 cols14-18=2's may miss extensions from row18's 3/5/etc.).
 * Bottom row (row27?) has [1,4,1,8,1,9,...] with 1's as bounds? but fills none around singles, which is partially correct for isolation but wrong if any vertical regions exist above; overall, it looks like partial horizontal fills without full region awareness, leaving potential vertical/mixed connections (e.g., row8 all 1's? vs possible bounds, row15 all 1's) unfilled or mismatched—does not match puzzle rules, as regions with clues like 3/5/7 in row18 should fill connected 8's above/beside, not default to 2's.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify background, detect framed blocks containing inner colored regions, extract a sequence of colors from a key row at the bottom, match inners to that sequence, and connect consecutive matched inners with paths of their color—horizontally within blocks and vertically between blocks, including shifting rows for multi-connection gaps. The output is the modified grid with these connections filled in, preserving the original structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the entire grid; all other colors represent objects, frames, or keys.
 * Blocks are vertical stacks of at least 2 consecutive non-background rows; they represent framed regions, and frames are detected as the dominant non-background color in uniform rows within a block (fallback to most frequent non-bg).
 * Inner regions are contiguous horizontal runs of the same non-background, non-frame color within blocks; these are merged vertically if they align in x-range and color, forming rectangular inners.
 * The key row is the bottommost row (scanning downward) with 3-12 isolated runs of non-background cells (total non-bg <=15), treated as single-cell colors in left-to-right order to form the sequence.
 * Inners are assigned to the sequence by matching colors, preferring leftmost unused inner for duplicates.
 * Connections: Horizontal gaps between same-block inners are filled directly if adjacent in x; vertical connections between different blocks use overlapping x-ranges in the gap rows between blocks, but for height-2 gaps with multiple connections, shift the lower block up by 1 row, fill the new single gap row with all connections (overlapping fills), and update positions.
 * Subtleties: Vertical plans only fill if x-overlap exists and gap rows are available; after shifts, remaining verticals are filled straightforwardly. Assume singles in key row (skip one after each non-bg). Fallback key row is h-2 if no match. No diagonal or non-rectangular fills. Preserve bg in fills only if empty.
 * Edge cases: No inners or short sequence skips output. Blocks sorted by y_start. Global updates for shifts affect blocks, key_row, and lower plans. Height-2 multi-conn shifts only bottom-to-top processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) implements a full pipeline for detecting bg, blocks, frames, inners, key row/sequence, assignment, and connections (horizontal direct, vertical with height-2 shift for multiples), but fails entirely due to a Python syntax error: "global key_row" is declared after key_row is used (in the shift logic), causing execution errors in all training examples and test.
 * What worked: Core detection functions (bg, blocks, inners, key row, sequence, assignment) appear logically sound based on puzzle rules; horizontal fills and basic vertical fills would likely work if executed; shift logic attempts to handle multi-connections in tight gaps by inserting space via row shift.
 * What didn't work: The global declaration bug crashes everything before any output; no actual grid modifications occur, so all results are errors instead of grids. Key row update in shifts uses global but is post-use. Assumes single-cell key entries (j +=1 after append), which may miss multi-cell keys. Vertical x-overlap is max(start)-min(end), which could be empty if no overlap. No handling for same-color inners in different blocks without vertical gaps. Fallback frame detection may pick inners as frame if no uniform rows.
 * The main program structure is helpful for future but needs bug fixes; inner extraction via temp_inners and grouping is essential for merging rectangles.
 * No prior attempts, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of sequencing and connections but zero execution success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error, not a grid, so it does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution; expected is a modified grid with connections filled, but nothing generates due to the crash.
 * Specifically, the error prevents any observation of whether detections (e.g., inners, sequence) or fills (e.g., horizontals, verticals with shifts) work for the test input; without running, we can't confirm if the logic would produce correct paths (e.g., if test has height-2 multi-conns needing shift, or non-overlapping verticals to skip).
 * The error output is identical across all examples, indicating the bug is universal and blocks all progress; test likely needs the shift logic (if multi-conns present) or basic verticals, but we can't verify differences from expected without fixed execution—assume incorrect until fixed and outputs grids.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (often 8 or 1) and colored components that form incomplete frames or outlines enclosing small inner regions; the goal is to fill gaps between adjacent or overlapping frames with a specific color chosen based on isolated color markers at the bottom of the grid, effectively completing symmetric or connected shapes while preserving the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is typically the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training examples 1-3, 1 in the test); all fills must only overwrite bg cells, never existing colors.
 * Bottom isolates are single non-bg cells in the bottom row (or near-bottom) flanked by bg on both sides; there must be at least 3 such isolates in a row to be valid, and their positions (indexed from 1) and colors guide color selection for fills via adjacency rules (e.g., choose the color whose position is minimal in adjacent pairs).
 * Frames are medium-sized connected components (5-50 cells) of a single color (frame_color, chosen as the color with the most such components); these enclose 1-8 cell inner regions of a different color, which must be identified within the frame's bounding box.
 * Fills occur between pairs of frames that overlap in one dimension (rows for horizontal pairs, columns for vertical) with a small gap (1-3 bg cells); the fill color is selected from the two inner colors based on bottom isolate adjacency, and fills only the gap rows/columns using the union or range from the inners.
 * Subtlety: Horizontal pairs fill specific rows from the union of inner colored rows; vertical pairs fill specific columns from the chosen inner's range; gaps must be exactly between frames without full overlap or large separations.
 * Overlapping frames must share the overlap dimension but have a gap in the other; inners must be exactly one per frame and small (1-8 cells) to qualify.
 * Easy to miss: Frame_color selection prioritizes medium components but may fail if multiple colors qualify; bottom isolates are only considered if >=3 in a single row; fills don't extend beyond the gap or overwrite non-bg; the bottom row itself has scattered single-color isolates (1-9) that aren't filled but guide the logic.
 * Components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right); visited tracking prevents revisiting in inner extraction.
 * Puzzle assumes a single frame_color; if none found, return unchanged grid.
 * Test input has wider grid (29 cols) and more complex nesting; bg=1, main fill color seems 2 with outliers (3-9); fills must respect multiple levels of frames.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies bg (e.g., 8 or 1) and frame_color via medium component count, and extracts bottom isolates only if >=3 in a row, which works for qualifying valid rows in all training examples.
 * find_components and identify_outers are helpful and correctly find frames/inners (e.g., detects small inners like the 7's in train1 row2-3, 2's in train2 row2-3), but pairing logic in get_pairs fails to detect all overlaps/gaps (e.g., misses horizontal overlap for 7's in train1 rows2-4 cols11-17, where gap=0 but should fill via adjacency).
 * What worked: Some vertical fills partially succeed, like extending 3's and 4's in train1 rows9-11/14-16, but incompletely (e.g., train1 row10 col5-6 filled as 3 but expected full extension); bottom isolate adjacency selection works for simple cases but ignores non-adjacent colors.
 * What didn't: No fills applied in many gap areas, leaving bg (8 or 1) where expected colors propagate (e.g., train1: rows2-4 cols11-13/15-17 remain 8 instead of 7; rows5-7 cols2-3/16-17 remain 8 instead of 2/6; row10 cols1-5/7 remain 8 instead of 3; row13 cols8-9 remain 8 instead of 9; row15 cols11-14 remain 8 instead of 4).
 * Train1 differences: Generated misses horizontal fills for 2 (rows5-7 cols2-3), 6 (rows5-7 cols16-17), 9 (row13 cols8-9), and partial 3/4 extensions; also no vertical fill for 7's across cols11-17 in rows2-4; bottom row unchanged correctly, but isolates not fully guiding all pairs.
 * Train2 differences: Generated misses fills like 2 in row2 col4/row3 col2 (expected 2 extensions); 3 in row4 col6/row6 col2? Wait, row4 is all bg except isolates, but expected 3 at row4 col6; row6 col4-5 as 4 but generated bg; row7 col4 as 4 but generated 1? No, generated has some 4/6 but misses 5 extensions in row7 col10-11? Unknown why partial—perhaps overlap check fails for vertical pairs.
 * Train3 differences: Generated has almost no fills beyond existing (e.g., misses 2 extensions in row3 cols11-15 to 2; 4 in row9 cols14-16/20-21? row10 col19-21 as 4 but generated bg; vertical 6 in rows12-16 col11 as 6 but generated bg; 9 in row6 col19 as 9 but generated bg; row18-22 almost unchanged, missing 8? fills); wider grid causes bbox issues, with inners not paired due to gap>3 or no overlap.
 * get_pairs is broken for vertical fills (e.g., fill_cols from chosen_o only, but should union or extend; overlap_check uses wrong indices for vertical); apply_fills only fills if bg but doesn't handle multi-row/col properly.
 * find_bottom_isolates is helpful but too strict (only one row checked, misses multi-row bottoms in test); get_all_pos correctly maps colors to positions but assumes single row.
 * Overall, attempt understands frame/inner extraction and bottom-guided color choice but fails on pair detection (gaps/overlaps) and fill application (wrong ranges/union), leading to under-filling; no over-filling observed.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it primarily fills large areas with 2 (e.g., rows1-6/8-13/15-? cols1-6/8-13/21-25 as 2, matching some inner 2's) but leaves many bg=1 cells unfilled where extensions are needed (e.g., row3 col6-7/13-? should extend 4/8/9 but remain 1; row10 col3-6/21-24 should extend 6/4 but partial/missing; row17-20 cols14-20/22-25 have some 2 but miss 5/3 extensions like row18 col17 as 5→full row? ; bottom row22-26 have 3/7 but no upward fills to connect).
 * It over-fills some 2 areas beyond frames (e.g., row15-16 cols14-20 as 2, but input has no inner there—perhaps false pair); ignores isolates like 8/9/4/7/6/9/4/5/3/7, only using adjacent for partial 2/4 fills, missing vertical propagations (e.g., no 6 fill in col11 rows8-14).
 * Makes sense for simple horizontal 2 fills but not for complex vertical/nested (e.g., row18 has 9/4/5/3 but no fills above); likely pairing misses small gaps or wrong overlap, leaving ~70% of expected fills undone; to handle test, need better multi-row bottom scan and union fills for vertical pairs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing a 2D structure like a cave or channel system) with 0s (empty space or background), 1s (walls or barriers), and numbered values representing colored blocks or components. The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, classifying them as "bottom" (near the grid's bottom edge) or "upper" blocks, pairing them by color and position, grouping into channels based on column overlaps, and then modifying the grid (e.g., filling or connecting channels between paired blocks) to produce an output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed by same-color cells (values != 0 and != 1), using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections are not considered.
 * Bottom blocks are specifically those whose maximum row (max_r) reaches n-2 (second-to-last row), suggesting the puzzle treats the very last row (n-1) as a special boundary (e.g., floor or outflow), not part of blocks.
 * Upper blocks are all non-bottom blocks not touching that near-bottom level; this implies a vertical layering where blocks are stacked or separated by rows.
 * Pairing happens by color, sorting both upper and bottom lists by minimum column (min_c) to match left-to-right order; this assumes blocks don't overlap in complex ways and that column position indicates correspondence.
 * Channels are groups of upper blocks whose column ranges overlap (max(min_c) <= min(max_c)), suggesting horizontal "tunnels" or paths; channels are assigned IDs incrementally and sorted internally by min_r (top-to-bottom stacking).
 * The program must return a modified copy of the grid (using deepcopy), but the current implementation doesn't apply any fills/connections—it just identifies structures and returns the unchanged grid, which is incomplete.
 * Subtlety: Block bounds (min_r/max_r, min_c/max_c) are computed via flood-fill (DFS with stack), which correctly handles irregular shapes but assumes colors don't mix (same color only).
 * Grid dimensions: n rows, m columns; assumes rectangular input, no empty rows/columns.
 * Potential misses: No handling for single-cell blocks, multi-block channels with gaps, or colors with unequal upper/bottom counts (pairing takes min length, ignoring extras). No actual grid modification (e.g., filling paths between paired blocks with a specific value like color or 2). Errors arise from undefined 'g' in helper functions (scoping issue: helpers use len(g) but g is only in program(); need to pass grid or use n/m from blocks).
 * All training and test runs failed due to execution errors, so no actual outputs to verify against expected puzzle results (e.g., filled channels or connected paths).

    # Note: Currently broken due to 'g' scoping; pass n explicitly or compute from blocks
    n = len(g)
    return [b for b in blocks if b['max_r'] == n - 2]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided identifies connected components correctly via flood-fill but fails to execute due to scoping errors ('g' undefined in helpers like get_bottom_blocks, get_upper_blocks, and identify_channels, which reference len(g) without passing g).
 * What worked: find_special_blocks properly extracts blocks with bounds and color; pairing logic (pair_blocks_by_color) sensibly matches by color and sorted columns; channel grouping (identify_channels) handles overlaps via nested loops.
 * What didn't work: No grid modification—returns deepcopy without applying puzzle logic (e.g., filling channels between pairs); all runs (training 1-3, test) errored with "name 'g' is not defined", producing no outputs instead of modified grids. get_bottom_blocks and get_upper_blocks are incomplete/broken (rely on unpassed g; upper_blocks filters vaguely with len(g)-2). pair_blocks_by_color assumes min_c for sorting but ignores block widths (may mispair wide blocks). identify_channels assigns incremental IDs but doesn't use them for output; loop inefficiency for large channels.
 * get_upper_blocks is not helpful (vague filter, broken scoping; better to derive from blocks without g).
 * No training or test outputs generated, so cannot verify if block extraction matches expected (e.g., correct component counts or bounds); differences unknown but likely irrelevant since no modification occurs.
 * Function get_bottom_blocks is partially helpful for bottom detection but broken (fix by passing n); pair_blocks_by_color is useful for matching but may fail on non-singleton blocks (uses min_c only).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("name 'g' is not defined"), not a valid grid; this does not make sense or look correct, as the puzzle requires a modified List[List[int]] output, likely with filled channels or connections (e.g., propagating color from bottom to upper pairs along non-overlapping paths, avoiding walls=1).
 * No actual grid produced, so it mismatches any expected test solution (e.g., if test has specific color flows, nothing is filled); errors prevent checking if block identification is accurate for test input.
 * To handle test case, must fix scoping (pass grid or dimensions to helpers) and implement grid fills (e.g., for each pair, fill vertical/horizontal paths in channels with color or a fill value, respecting 1s as barriers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains colored blocks (numbers 1-9 representing colors) separated by background (bg, often 8 or 1), with a legend sequence in the second-to-last row indicating an order to connect consecutive colored blocks by filling straight-line gaps (horizontal or vertical) between them using the color of the starting block in each pair, effectively merging or extending blocks to form paths or shapes matching the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend sequence is extracted from non-bg cells in the second-to-last row (n-2), representing the order of colors to connect (e.g., connect first available block of color A to first of B, then B to C, etc.).
 * Connections only fill background gaps in straight horizontal or vertical lines between bounding boxes of consecutive blocks if they align on the same row(s) or column(s); no diagonal or complex path filling.
 * Multiple blocks per color exist (e.g., several disconnected 2's), so they must be processed in positional order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting by min_r then min_c) using a queue to select the "next" available block for connection.
 * Fill only bg cells; do not overwrite existing non-bg cells, and fills should merge blocks without expanding beyond the gap between bboxes.
 * Background is always the top-left cell's value (e.g., 8 in training, 1 in test); legend skips bg in extraction.
 * Subtle: Connections may chain across the sequence, so popping/using blocks in order can leave later blocks unconnected if wrong pairs are chosen; some expected outputs show horizontal fills spanning multiple columns (e.g., 7's connecting across in ex1 row 2-3) or vertical extensions.
 * Easy to miss: Not all blocks of a color are connected in every step—only consecutive in sequence; leftover blocks remain unchanged. Also, bboxes must be precise (min/max r/c of connected components via flood-fill/DFS/stack).
 * Grids have frame-like 1's in some cases (e.g., outlining shapes), which should not be filled into unless part of a connection.
 * In test case, bg=1 acts as both frame and separator, so fills must distinguish carefully to avoid merging unintended areas.
 * Sequence length is len(legend)-1 connections; process sequentially without revisiting.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills entire row/col spans between bboxes, but if bboxes don't perfectly align (e.g., partial overlap), it may fill extra or miss (e.g., ex1 misses 5-to-7 horizontal merge).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg from top-left; essential and works in all cases.)

```python
def extract_legend(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    return [g[n-2][c] for c in range(m) if g[n-2][c] != bg]
```
(This accurately pulls the sequence from row n-2, skipping bg; works perfectly in examples, e.g., ex1 seq=[2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5].)

```python
def find_connected_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    blocks: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]] = defaultdict(list)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(m):
            if g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                col = g[r][c]
                min_r = max_r = r
                min_c = max_c = c
                stack = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    rr, cc = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, rr)
                    max_r = max(max_r, rr)
                    min_c = min(min_c, cc)
                    max_c = max(max_c, cc)
                    for dr, dc in dirs:
                        nr = rr + dr
                        nc = cc + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == col:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                blocks[col].append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return blocks
```
(This flood-fills to find connected components and their bounding boxes correctly; essential for identifying blocks, works in all cases without errors.)

```python
def sort_blocks_by_position(blocks: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]:
    for col in blocks:
        blocks[col] = sorted(blocks[col], key=lambda bbox: (bbox[0], bbox[2]))
    return blocks
```
(This sorts bboxes per color by top row then left col, enabling queue-based "first available" selection; helpful and correct, but may need refinement for multi-block ordering.)

```python
def fill_horizontal_gap(g: List[List[int]], left_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], right_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], fill_col: int, bg: int) -> None:
    min_r = left_bbox[0]
    max_r = left_bbox[1]
    start_c = left_bbox[3] + 1
    end_c = right_bbox[2]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(start_c, end_c):
            if g[r][c] == bg:
                g[r][c] = fill_col

def fill_vertical_gap(g: List[List[int]], up_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], down_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], fill_col: int, bg: int) -> None:
    min_c = up_bbox[2]
    max_c = up_bbox[3]
    start_r = up_bbox[1] + 1
    end_r = down_bbox[0]
    for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
        for r in range(start_r, end_r):
            if g[r][c] == bg:
                g[r][c] = fill_col
```
(These fill straight gaps correctly if bboxes align, using start color; helpful but limited—only works for perfect row/col alignment, misses partial overlaps or non-straight needs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core connection logic is flawed despite good block detection.
 * Ex1 generated: Connected some 1-5 and 1-7 vertically/horizontally in upper sections (e.g., filled 1's around 2/5/7), but missed key horizontal merges like 5-to-7 in rows 2-3 (generated has separate 5's and 7's; expected connects 7's across cols 11-16 with 7 fills), 1-to-3 in rows 9-10 (generated leaves gap; expected fills 3's into col5-6), and bottom 4-to-2 (generated no fill; expected 4's extend to col13-16). Also, row12 has 9's but no connection to prior. Unknown why 7's didn't merge—possibly wrong bbox pairing or alignment check.
 * Ex2 generated: Filled some vertical 1's and 7's (e.g., row6 col2/4/6/8/10/12/14 with 7's? But output shows partial), but missed horizontal extensions like 3 in row4 col6 (expected isolated but connected? Wait, expected has 3 in row4 col6 unchanged, but 5's connect horizontally in row2 col10-12, and 4's connect in row6 col6-8; generated leaves 5's separate at col10 and col12, no 4 merge in row6, and 7's/9's unconnected. Fills overdid some 1's or missed seq order [from legend row11: 2,3,4,6,5,7,9?].
 * Ex3 generated: Detected blocks but minimal fills—e.g., no merges in upper sections (expected connects 3's horizontally in row3 cols3-8, 2's in row3 cols11-15, 9's in row3 cols19-21; generated leaves all separate), lower 4's/6's in row9 cols14-18 unmerged (expected 4's span), and 6's in rows13-17 col11 isolated (expected vertical stack). Also, row20 7's unfilled. Seems to pop wrong blocks from queues, skipping alignments.
 * Overall: Block finding/sorting/legend extraction works (no errors there), but connect_two_blocks fails on non-aligned bboxes (e.g., partial row overlap not handled—fills only full bbox height/width, missing partial gaps) and queue popping assumes strict first-to-first, but seq may require matching closest/aligned blocks, not positional first. No chaining effects (e.g., after connecting A-B, B's new bbox isn't updated for B-C).
 * connect_two_blocks is helpful but broken for partial alignments (e.g., if rows overlap partially, no fill; needs extension to max(min_r, other_min_r) etc.).
 * program overall copies grid correctly and uses queues, but loop only does len(seq)-1 connections without re-finding blocks post-fill, so no iterative merging.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, but fill functions need enhancement for overlap.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills with 2's in many places (e.g., rows 1-5/8-13/15-21 have extensive 2 fills connecting across sections, like row3 col3-8/10-13/21-25, but this merges unrelated blocks and ignores sequence [likely from row26: 4,9,8,9,9,6,4,6,7,6,6,9,9,3,4,3,5,3,3,1,7,... non-1, but 8 is present? Wait, bg=1, legend non-1]. Expected should connect specific pairs like 2-to-4 in upper, but output fills entire rows with 2's, e.g., row16-20 all 2's in cols14-24, which looks like blob expansion rather than targeted gaps. Also, lower row22-25 has 2's filled into what should be isolated, and row27 legend unchanged but 1's overwritten? Misses vertical connections (e.g., 6's/7's in row10/27 unmerged) and creates uniform 2-regions that don't match puzzle's discrete shape extensions. This suggests wrong fill extents or ignoring alignments, making it incoherent for the sequence-based merging.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where numbered cells (2-9 represent colored blocks or regions, 1s are barriers or walls, and 8 is empty background) must be connected or extended into complete shapes based on a sequence extracted from a "key row" (likely the bottom or a specific row with clues). The goal is to fill gaps in background (8) areas between consecutive blocks in the sequence, respecting overlaps in rows/columns and barrier constraints, to form the expected filled regions without altering existing cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The key row is not always the bottom row; it must be identified as the row (starting from bottom) with 3-12 clue cells (2-9) where the number of runs of consecutive clues equals the clue count (i.e., no adjacent clues, suggesting isolated clues).
 * Sequence extraction skips non-clue cells (1s and 8s), creating an ordered list of 2-9 values that dictates connection order (e.g., connect block of seq[0] to seq[1], then seq[1] to seq[2], etc.).
 * Blocks are connected components of the same number (2-9), found via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with 4-directional adjacency); each block is represented by its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * Gaps are filled only between consecutive blocks in the sequence if they "overlap" in the perpendicular dimension: for horizontal gaps (no column overlap, but row overlap), fill vertically separated areas; for vertical gaps (no row overlap, but column overlap), fill horizontally separated areas. Fill only background (8) cells, using the color of the first block (c1).
 * Barriers (1s) block filling and connectivity; blocks cannot cross 1s, and gaps cannot be filled over or through 1s.
 * Background is hardcoded as 8, but in test input, it appears to be 1 in some places (e.g., borders and separators), suggesting 1 might serve dual role as barrier and possible background in unfilled areas— this is a subtlety, as code assumes 8 is fillable bg.
 * Connections may require multiple passes or considering all pairs in sequence, but current code does one pass popping blocks left-to-right, which may mismatch if multiple blocks per color exist or if order is wrong.
 * Subtle: Overlap calculation uses max(0, end - start +1) for rows/columns; if no overlap in one dimension but gap in the other, fill the gap fully in the overlap range, but only if gap_start > gap_end is false (i.e., actual gap exists).
 * Easy to miss: Blocks are sorted by (min_r, min_c) per color, and deques popleft() assumes leftmost/topmost blocks are used first for connections, but this may not match puzzle intent if sequence implies specific pairings (e.g., nearest or spatially logical).
 * No filling if blocks already touch or overlap fully; also, no diagonal connections—only orthogonal.
 * In expectations, some regions extend beyond simple gaps (e.g., in ex1, 7 extends horizontally into what looks like barrier-adjacent areas, and vertically in other places; in ex2, 2 and 5 extend across barriers? Wait, no—looking closely, extensions respect 1s but fill 8s into shapes).
 * Puzzle may involve "stretching" or merging blocks only if they are the "next" in sequence, and unused blocks remain as-is.
 * All changes are non-destructive (deepcopy g, only fill if ==bg).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly identifies isolated-clue rows as keys and extracts sequences accurately (e.g., for ex1, seq likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5], skipping 8s).
 * What worked: Block detection via connected components is solid (preserves existing shapes like the 1-bordered regions); gap-filling logic correctly checks overlaps and only fills bg=8, avoiding overwrites; uses deques for ordered block consumption per color.
 * What didn't work: Fails to connect all required gaps—e.g., in ex1, 7 blocks not extended leftward into col11-13 or rightward fully (generated has isolated 7s in col14-15 row2-3 and col15-16 row2-3? Wait, output shows 7,7,1 in row2 col14-16, but expected has 7s in col11-13 and 15-17 row2-3, plus vertical extensions? Unknown why partial); similarly, 2 in row5-7 col2-3 not connected downward, 3 in row9-10 col1-5 not fully horizontal to col5-6, 4 in row14-15 col8-9 not extended right to col11-14, etc. Differences: Generated leaves many 8s unfilled where expected has color extensions (e.g., row2 col11-13=7, row5 col2-3=2 extended down; row9 col5-6=3; row13 col8-10=9? No, row13 has 9,9 in col8-9 expected but not in generated; generated row13 all 8s except later).
 * In ex2: Minimal filling (only existing blocks), but expected connects 2 horizontally in row2 col3 and col4-5? (generated has 2 only at row2 col2), 3 vertical? No, row4 col2=3 expected but not, 5 in row2 col10 and col12-13 connected; 4 in row6 col6-7 extended right? Differences: Generated ignores most connections, leaving isolated singles (e.g., no 2 at row2 col4, no 3 at row4 col6, no 4 extensions in row6 col8-9, no 5 at row2 col12-13); unknown if block popping order mismatches spatial needs.
 * In ex3: Some vertical stacking in lower blocks (e.g., 6 repeated in rows13-17 col11), but expected has horizontal extensions like 3 in row3 col6-8, 2 in row3 col11-13 and col17? No, and 4 in row9 col14-16, 9 vertical in row6 col19-20? Differences: Generated fills vertically downward for some (e.g., row18-22 all 1-frames with no fills), but misses horizontal merges (e.g., row3: generated has single 3 at col3, single 2 at col11, single 9 at col19; expected has 3x3 at col3-5? Wait row3 col3=3, but extended to col6-8=3; 2 at col11 extended to 13; 9 single but vertical later); also overfills? No, but leaves upper regions unfilled (e.g., row6 all 8s, expected has 9 at col19).
 * Block sorting and popleft() assumes sequential left/top pairing, but may need nearest-block matching or all-pairs checking.
 * find_key_row fallback to h-2 works if bottom is key, but in ex3 (27 cols? rows), it may pick wrong if multiple candidates.
 * No handling for multiple blocks per color in sequence (e.g., two 2s in seq for ex1); pops only one per pair, leaving others unused.
 * deepcopy and main program structure is good, but loop only for i in range(len(seq)-1), assuming one-to-one blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to partially fill some 2-regions (e.g., extending 2s horizontally/vertically within 1-frames in rows1-6,9-13,15-20,21-25? But places singletons like 4 at row3 col3, 8 at row3 col10 (8 is bg, shouldn't place?), 9 at row3 col22, 6 at row10 col3, etc., which seem like misplaced or unconnected clues rather than merged shapes.
 * Issues: Fills large 2 areas but ignores sequence order—bottom row27 seq likely [4,9,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7] (skipping 1s), so should connect 4 to 9 horizontally/vertically in gaps, but generated has scattered singles (e.g., 4 at row16 col14? But no merges; 8 placed erroneously?); upper regions like row15-20 have 2s filled in col14-18 and col20-24, but no color-specific extensions (all 2s, ignoring seq colors); borders are 1s, so bg=1? But code assumes 8, causing no fills where 1 is "bg" (e.g., inner areas unfilled properly). Does not match expected logic, as shapes should be color-specific merges (e.g., connect first 4 block to first 9, filling 1-gaps if possible, but respects 1-barriers); looks like over-reliance on 2-fills (perhaps misidentified key or seq), missing multi-color connections; unknown why singles like 8/9/4 appear without expansion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid with a background color (typically 1), framed blocks (often color 2) containing inner shapes of various colors (3-9), and a key row (usually near the bottom) providing a sequence of colors that dictates the order in which to connect matching inner shapes. The goal is to draw connections (fills) between consecutive shapes in the sequence using the color of the first shape in each pair, handling both horizontal and vertical gaps while preserving the original grid structure except for these connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is detected as the top-left color; frames are uniform non-background colors surrounding inners within horizontal blocks of at least 2 rows.
 * Inners are extracted as contiguous vertical strips of the same non-background, non-frame color within blocks; they must be grouped by exact x-range and color to form complete shapes.
 * Key row is selected as the lowest row with 3-12 runs of non-background and <=15 non-background cells total; the sequence is the ordered non-background colors in that row (skipping backgrounds).
 * Assignment: Sort available inners by y_start then x_start; greedily assign the leftmost/topmost unused inner matching each sequence color in order (skips if no match, allowing multiples of same color to be used sequentially).
 * Connections: Only between consecutively assigned inners; use first inner's color to fill background gaps. Horizontal: Fill x-gaps in overlapping y-range if gap exists. Vertical: Fill y-gaps in overlapping x-range, but only in fully background ("empty") rows within the gap; if >2 empty rows, fill all; if <=2, fill only the last (bottommost) one—this seems like a heuristic that may miss full paths.
 * Subtleties: No self-connections or loops; connections don't overwrite existing non-background cells; vertical fills are conditional on empty rows to avoid overfilling, but this can leave gaps unfilled if rows aren't fully empty. Inners with height 1 are allowed. Duplicate colors in sequence require multiple matching inners, assigned in spatial order. Fallback key row is h-2 if no suitable row found. Preserve key row unchanged. Blocks ignore single-row non-background strips.
 * Easy to miss: Frame detection uses majority or uniform color per block, but falls back to most common non-bg; may misdetect if mixed. Connections only for assigned pairs, so unassigned inners remain isolated. Horizontal fills are straightforward, but vertical heuristic (partial fill for small gaps) may not create smooth paths in sparse areas.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; no prior versions summarized, but the code builds on standard grid processing.
 * Successfully detects blocks, frames, and inners correctly for training examples (all 3 passed), extracting shapes accurately.
 * Key row detection and sequence extraction work well for trainings, selecting appropriate row and order.
 * Assignment of inners to sequence via spatial sorting (top-left first) works for trainings, handling multiples correctly.
 * Horizontal connections fill gaps properly in overlapping y-ranges, preserving non-bg cells.
 * Vertical connections partially work but use a heuristic (fill all if >2 empty rows, else only last) that succeeds in trainings but may underfill in test.
 * No major misses in omission of single-row blocks or height-1 inners, as trainings passed.
 * Function `find_all_inners` is essential and correct for extracting objects; groups vertical contigs properly.
 * Function `detect_frame_color` is helpful but can fallback to majority, which is fine if uniform in trainings.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though vertical fill logic in main program may need generalization (e.g., always fill all empty rows in gap, not just heuristic).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially connects inners based on the key row sequence (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7), filling some horizontal gaps with matching colors (e.g., row 3 has 4's connecting 2-frame areas around an 8 inner, and a 9 appears isolated but assigned).
 * Vertical connections appear incomplete or selective: e.g., in the middle block (rows ~10-13), a 6 and 7 are present but no clear vertical fills between blocks; lower block (rows ~16-20) shows 9,4,5,3 inners but gaps remain unfilled (e.g., row 15 has isolated 6, not connected upward).
 * Expected: Full path connections forming a continuous line snaking through assigned inners (e.g., connect first 4 (top-left) to 8 below-right with 4-fills, then to 9, etc., filling all bg gaps in horizontal/vertical without the partial vertical rule; key row unchanged, all assigned inners linked in sequence order, unassigned inners untouched).
 * Observed differences: Some fills like extra 4's in row 3 and 9 in row 7/21 are present but seem misplaced (e.g., row 7 has lone 9 not tied to sequence path); vertical gaps (e.g., between row 6 and 8, or 13 and 15) are not filled, leaving disconnected components where a smooth path is expected; bottom block has partial horizontal fills (e.g., row 17 has 9,4,5,3 but no bridging 1's turned to prior color like 5 or 3). This does not fully match expected continuous connections—likely due to vertical heuristic underfilling small gaps and greedy assignment picking wrong inners for duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's/9's, but spatial order may skip intended path). The output makes partial sense (some links visible) but looks incorrect overall, as the path isn't complete/continuous.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 18:31:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle consisting of a grid with multiple horizontal "blocks" (strips of 2+ rows containing non-background content, separated by all-background rows), where each block has a frame (typically color 1) enclosing inner contiguous regions of various colors (2+). A special "key row" near the bottom encodes a sequence of colors (non-background cells in that row), and the goal is to match inner regions across all blocks to this sequence by color, then connect consecutive matched regions horizontally (filling x-gaps in overlapping y-ranges) and vertically (filling y-gaps in overlapping x-ranges) using the color of the first region, effectively linking them while respecting frame/background constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks must be at least 2 rows tall and consist of non-all-background rows; empty or single-row strips are ignored.
 * Frame color detection is critical but fragile: it first checks for rows within the block that have exactly one unique non-background color (candidate for frame), taking the common one if unique; falls back to the most common non-background color overall. This fails subtly when inner regions span the full width/height of a block, creating rows with only inner colors (no visible frame), causing the inner color (e.g., 2) to be misdetected as frame—leading to no fills in background (1) gaps.
 * Inner regions ("inners") are contiguous horizontal runs of the same non-background, non-frame color within a block; vertically adjacent runs of the same color/x-range are merged into rectangular-ish blobs. Single-cell or non-contiguous same-color areas are treated separately if not merged.
 * Key row selection: Scan from bottom up for a row with 3-12 "runs" (sequences of non-background) and <=15 non-background cells total; default to second-last row if none found. Sequence is simply the list of non-background colors in left-to-right order (ignores background 1s).
 * Assignment of inners to sequence: Global across all blocks; for each sequence color, greedily pick the unused inner of that color with the minimal (y_start, x_start) position (top-left priority). This ignores block boundaries, spatial order, or sequence flow, potentially assigning "wrong" inners (e.g., a top-block inner to a late-sequence color, skipping lower ones) and causing cross-block or backward connections.
 * Horizontal connections: Only if x-ranges don't overlap and there's a gap; fill gap columns in the overlapping y-range (max y_start to min y_end) only where cells == empty_color (bg=1 if frame==1, else frame color). If no y-overlap (e.g., different blocks), no fill.
 * Vertical connections: Only if y-ranges don't overlap and there's a gap; fill entire gap rows in the overlapping x-range, but only if *all* cells in that sub-row (x-overlap) are empty_color—otherwise skip the row. This is stricter than horizontal (full-row-empty check), potentially missing partial fills.
 * Empty_color subtlety: Always bg (1) if frame is 1, but frame if frame !=1; combined with bad frame detection, this prevents filling true background (1) gaps when frame is mis-set to an inner color (e.g., only fills over misplaced "frame" cells, ignoring 1s).
 * Puzzle assumes colors 1+ (1=bg/frame), inners don't touch block edges directly in some cases, but code handles touching. Connections shouldn't overwrite existing non-empty cells (innners/frames). Global assignment may work for simple cases but fails when colors repeat across blocks without positional ordering.
 * Edge cases: Repeated colors in sequence/block (e.g., multiple 4s); single-column inners (e.g., 9s); key row with alternating bg/colored (e.g., 1,4,1,8,... → sequence [4,8,...]); vertical fills skipped if any cell in x-overlap isn't empty (e.g., stray frame pixel blocks whole row).
 * No rotation/reflection; grid is row-major List[List[int]]; deepcopy input to avoid mutation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/last submission provided; no prior attempts to compare.
 * Core extraction (blocks, inners) works well for identifying structures in training cases.
 * Frame detection is broken for blocks where inners create full single-color rows (mistakes inner for frame, e.g., 2 as frame in top block), preventing fills in bg=1 gaps—key failure in test.
 * Assignment greedy top-left works for unique colors or simple layouts (as in trainings) but fails subtly for repeated colors across blocks (assigns earliest positions first, leading to mismatched pairs like connecting top 4 to later lower 4, ignoring spatial sequence flow).
 * Key row detection and sequence extraction are solid and match expected (e.g., ignores 1s in alternating key).
 * Horizontal connects are mostly correct but skip non-empty_color gaps due to bad empty_color; vertical connects are overly strict (full sub-row empty check misses partial gaps, e.g., if a frame pixel blocks a row).
 * Trainings 1-3 passed fully, suggesting logic handles basic framed blocks with proper gaps (fills frame-color spaces correctly).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, but detect_frame_color needs fix (e.g., always assume frame=1 if bg=1, or check border colors only).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows minimal to no filling of gaps, leaving many 1-separated inner regions unconnected, which contradicts the expected puzzle goal of linking sequence-matched inners.
 * Specific observed effects: In top block (rows 1-5), row 3 has 4s (cols 3-5), then 1s (6-7), 4s (8-9), 8s (10-12), 1s (13-19), 8s (20-21), 9 (22), 2s (23-24)—no fills in 1-gaps (e.g., 6-7 stay 1, not filled with 4; 13-19 stay 1, not filled with 8 or 9), despite sequence starting 4-8-9 suggesting connections. Similarly, row 17 (lower block) has 9s (3-5), 1s (6-7), 9s (8-9), 4s (10-12), 1 (13), 4s (14-15), 5s (16-18), 1 (19), 5s (20-21), 3 (22), 2s (23-24)—gap at 13 stays 1, not filled (e.g., with 4), and 6-7/19 stay 1. Bottom block (rows 21-25) has partial 2s/3/7 but no evident gap fills (e.g., row 23: 2s,7,2s with possible 1s unfilled). Vertical connects appear absent (e.g., no filling between row 3's 9 and rows 4-5's 9 at col 22).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have filled 1-gaps with connecting colors (e.g., cols 6-9 in row 3 → 4s; cols 13-21 in row 3 → 8 or 9), creating solid color paths between matched inners per sequence [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7]. Instead, only existing inners remain, with 1s intact—likely due to frame misdetection (empty_color=2, skipping 1-gaps) and greedy assignment pairing distant/non-overlapping inners (no y/x overlap for fills). Some areas (e.g., row 17 col 14-15=4) may be input inners, not new fills. Overall, output looks like near-input grid with failed connections, not a solved puzzle.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 18:31:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 18:59:35] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 19:00:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of Python code that defines a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs, likely identifying patterns, objects, or features in 2D arrays representing visual elements like shapes, holes, or blobs. The code must correctly handle training examples and a test input to produce expected outputs, but the previous attempt failed fundamentally due to missing the required function structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations (training and test) result in errors, preventing any actual processing or output generation.
 * Grids are represented as List[List[int]], where values likely indicate colors, types, or states (e.g., 0 for empty, positive ints for object types), and the puzzle involves extracting or manipulating objects like blobs, holes, or dividers based on connectivity or adjacency rules.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, disconnected components, or keys that don't span the full grid; ensure object extraction considers 4-way or 8-way connectivity to avoid missing subtle merges or separations.
 * Outputs should match expected results for training examples (e.g., classifying or counting features) and generalize to the test input, which may introduce new configurations like asymmetric objects or partial overlaps.
 * All attempts must demonstrate puzzle understanding through correct feature detection (e.g., hole counts, blob shapes), but basic structural errors like missing functions block this entirely.
 * Considerations across attempts: Focus on robust grid traversal (e.g., flood fill for objects), validation of extracted features against puzzle rules, and avoiding assumptions about grid symmetry or uniform object sizes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No fully helpful functions from the previous attempt, as it failed at the structural level.
# Skeleton for future: Define a basic 'program' function that takes and processes the grid.
def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> str:  # Assuming output is a string description or classification
    # Implement grid processing here, e.g., extract objects and apply rules
    return "processed output"
```

```python
# Potential helpful extraction function (not from previous attempt, but inferred as essential for object-based puzzles)
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # Use flood fill or DFS/BFS to find connected components (blobs/objects)
    # For each: track position, size, hole_count (enclosed zeros), shape type
    objects = []
    visited = [[False for _ in row] for row in grid]
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming non-zero starts an object
                component = flood_fill(grid, i, j, visited)  # Custom flood_fill to get blob details
                hole_count = count_holes(grid, component)  # Subtle: count enclosed empty spaces
                objects.append({"pos": (i,j), "size": len(component), "holes": hole_count})
    return objects

def flood_fill(grid, start_i, start_j, visited):
    # Standard flood fill to collect connected cells of same type
    # Returns list of (i,j) positions in the blob
    pass  # Implement 4-connectivity or 8-connectivity as per puzzle rules

def count_holes(grid, component):
    # Identify and count enclosed regions (subtle: requires boundary detection)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt generated code without a 'program' function, causing immediate errors in all training examples and the test, with no actual output or processing occurring.
 * Nothing worked: No features were extracted, no rules applied, and the code was structurally invalid for the puzzle evaluator.
 * Everything failed due to the missing core function; this indicates a complete oversight of the basic requirement to structure code around 'program(grid)'.
 * No helpful functions were present or usable, as the code didn't even attempt grid processing—avoid generating raw scripts without the required function wrapper.
 * extract_objects-like functions are essential but absent; future attempts must include them to handle object detection, which seems central to identifying blobs, holes, or dividers.
 * All training examples (1-3) failed identically with the same error, showing no progress or partial understanding.
 * The attempt demonstrates zero grasp of puzzle rules, as no grid analysis was possible.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates no processing happened, so it can't match any expected puzzle solution for the test input grid.
 * Without the 'program' function, the test input (a specific grid) wasn't analyzed, missing opportunities to apply rules like object extraction or pattern matching; this is critically different from expected, as a correct output should describe or classify the test grid's features (e.g., "object with 2 holes" or similar).
 * The error persists across all cases, confirming the test output is invalid and unhelpful; it doesn't account for any puzzle subtleties like unique test configurations (e.g., asymmetric keys or partial objects), which require proper code execution to handle.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 19:00:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 19:28:43] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 19:29:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating Python code with a specific 'program' function to process inputs, likely grids or patterns, and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case. The goal is to solve the puzzle by iteratively improving the code based on feedback from runs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a function named exactly 'program' to be valid; without it, all runs fail immediately with an error.
 * Inputs appear to be grid-based (e.g., List[List[int]] or similar), and the puzzle involves rules for extracting or manipulating objects like blobs, holes, or shapes in the grid.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or keys that may not span the full grid; mismatches in blob shapes or omissions of specific features (e.g., hole counts, dividers) are common pitfalls.
 * Outputs must match expected results for training examples (which passed or failed in prior attempts, but here all errored) and the test input; mentally simulating grid rules is key to verifying.
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure code handles multiple training examples separately; avoid generating incomplete skeletons; focus on puzzle-specific logic like object extraction after basic structure is in place.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    """
    Core function that must be defined. Processes the input grid according to puzzle rules
    and returns the solution as a string or appropriate output.
    """
    # Skeleton: Add logic here for extracting objects, applying rules, etc.
    return "solution_output"
```

```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    """
    Helpful for identifying puzzle elements like blobs or shapes.
    Returns a list of dicts with properties (e.g., {'shape': ..., 'holes': ..., 'position': ...}).
    """
    objects = []
    # Example logic: Scan grid for connected components or patterns
    visited = [[False for _ in row] for row in grid]
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming 1s are object pixels
                component = flood_fill(grid, i, j, visited)  # Implement flood fill
                objects.append({'blob': component, 'holes': count_holes(component)})
    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All attempts failed due to the absence of the required 'program' function, resulting in immediate errors for every training example and the test input.
 * No puzzle logic was executed because of the structural error, so nothing worked in terms of solving the visual puzzle rules.
 * Generated code was incomplete or invalid as a whole, preventing any observation of effects like object extraction or output matching.
 * No helpful functions were demonstrated in the attempts, as the code didn't run; future attempts should start with the 'program' skeleton before adding puzzle-specific tools like extract_objects.
 * The function extraction or any grid processing logic is irrelevant until the basic 'program' function is included.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", which does not make sense or look correct because it indicates a fundamental structural failure rather than an attempt to process the test input grid.
 * No actual output was generated for the test input, so it cannot match any expected puzzle solution (e.g., no description of shapes, omissions, or rule applications observed).
 * This error prevents verifying if the code handles test-specific subtleties, like unique grid patterns or edge cases not in training examples; it is completely incorrect and unhelpful for progress.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 19:29:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where input grids contain partial "shapes" or "blobs" outlined by low numbers (like 1s) with seed values (higher numbers 2-9) inside them, and the task is to complete these shapes by filling entire regions with the seed number, often extending them horizontally or vertically to form consistent rectangular or patterned blocks, while incorporating or propagating elements from a clue row at the bottom (containing isolated numbers 2-9 separated by 8s, which seems to dictate the sequence, position, or mirroring of fills across the grid). The background remains 8, and the output creates a symmetric or mirrored "completed" artwork from the partial input.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are typically bordered by 1s (or sometimes 2s in the test input), enclosing a single or small group of identical higher numbers (e.g., a single 2 inside 1s); these must be expanded to fill the entire bordered region and sometimes beyond into adjacent empty (8) areas to match rectangular patterns (e.g., 1x2, 2x3, or 3x3 blocks), but only in specific directions—horizontal extensions are common within rows, while vertical extensions create stacked identical rows.
 * The bottom clue row (e.g., [8, 2, 8, 3, 8, 9, 8, 4, 8, 2, 8, 6, 8, 7, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8] in train 1 and 2, or a longer variant in train 3) acts as a key: the numbers (2-9) appear to correspond to the seed values that need to be placed or mirrored in upper grid sections, often in a left-to-right order matching their positions, with shapes repeated or mirrored vertically (e.g., top and bottom halves of the grid show similar but not identical patterns).
 * Subtle mirroring or replication: Upper shapes (rows 1-5) are often duplicated or extended downward (e.g., rows 5-7 in train 1 introduce new 2s and 6s that match clue elements), and lower shapes (e.g., rows 13-17) mirror upper ones but with adjustments (e.g., 3s extended leftward in train 1 row 9-10 to include columns 5-6). Empty rows of 8s separate sections, and fills do not cross these.
 * Grid sizes vary (20x20 for train 1/2, ~27x27 for train 3), so solutions must handle variable dimensions; fills stop at grid edges or 8 barriers, and no overfilling into unrelated areas.
 * Clues influence propagation: The sequence in the clue row (e.g., 2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5) seems to map to shape positions—first 2 might fill left-upper, second 2 fills another spot, etc.; in train 3, longer clue [8,3,8,2,8,9,...] leads to more complex extensions like 3x3 blocks for some numbers.
 * Overlaps or interactions: In some cases (e.g., train 1 row 2-3, columns 12-14), a 1-bordered 7 extends rightward into 8s to become three 7s, suggesting rules for "growing" based on clue order or symmetry; no diagonal fills observed—all are orthogonal.
 * Background preservation: All non-shape areas remain 8; 1s (borders) are replaced by the fill number in outputs, indicating borders are temporary and get overwritten.
 * Easy-to-miss: Single-seed shapes (e.g., isolated 4 in train 2 row 6 col 7) extend both horizontally and vertically (becoming 1x3 or more); vertical stacks (e.g., rows 5-7 all identical in train 1) create "pillars" matching clue numbers; test input uses 1s and 2s as mixed borders, suggesting borders can be variable (not always 1), and all-1 top row might be a frame to fill or ignore.
 * No filling across sections: Shapes in upper vs. lower halves are independent but mirrored; clue row itself is unchanged in outputs.
 * Potential errors in partial fills: Inputs have incomplete rows (e.g., train 1 row 2 has 1,2,2,1 but expected fills to match height/width); rule might involve finding connected 1-components and replacing with the max/enclosed number, then extending to match clue positions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions from the previous attempt, as it was a simple identity copy with no logic for shape detection or filling.

```python
# Potential helpful function: Detect connected components of borders (1s) and enclosed seeds.
# This could identify blobs; current attempt had none, but it's essential for isolating shapes.

    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]

    for r in range(rows):

                visited[r][c] = True

                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:

                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            if g[nx][ny] == 1:
                                visited[nx][ny] = True
                                queue.append((nx, ny))
                                component.append((nx, ny))
                            elif g[nx][ny] > 1 and g[nx][ny] <= 9:
                                seed = max(seed, g[nx][ny])
                if seed > 1:  # Only if there's a valid seed
                    blobs.append((seed, (min(component, key=lambda p: p[0]*cols + p[1]), component))
    return blobs
```

```python
# Potential tool: Extract clue row and map to positions.
def extract_clues(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """

    """
    last_row = g[-1]
    return [val for val in last_row if val != 8 and 1 <= val <= 9]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The only attempt was an identity function (def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]: return [row[:] for row in g]), which simply copies the input grid unchanged; this worked for preserving background 8s and exact input positions but failed completely on all transformations needed.
 * Train 1: Generated matches input (partial 1-borders with single 2s/5s/7s/3s/9s/6s, no extensions), but expected fills and extends shapes—e.g., row 2: generated [8,1,2,2,1,8,8,1,5,5,1,8,8,8,1,7,7,1,8,8] vs. expected [8,1,2,2,1,8,8,1,5,5,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,8,8] (missing rightward 7 extension to col 13-14, borders not overwritten); row 5: generated all 8s in cols 2-3/16-17 vs. expected 2s/6s (new vertical pillar shapes introduced/mirrored from clues); row 9: generated [8,1,3,3,1,8,8,1,9,9,1,8,8,8,1,6,6,1,8,8] vs. expected [8,1,3,3,1,3,3,1,9,9,1,8,8,8,1,6,6,1,8,8] (missing leftward 3 extension to cols 5-6); row 13: generated all 8s in cols 8-11/15-18 vs. expected 9s/2s (missing mirrored lower shapes); unknown reason for new pillars in rows 5-7, but clearly not handled.
 * Train 2: Generated matches input (e.g., single 2/3/5/7 in row 2, single 7/4/6/9 in row 6), but expected extends horizontally/vertically—e.g., row 2: generated [8,1,2,1,8,1,3,1,8,1,5,1,8,1,7,1,8,8,8,8] vs. expected [8,1,2,1,2,1,3,1,8,1,5,1,5,1,7,1,8,8,8,8] (missing rightward extensions for 2/5); row 5: generated all 8s in cols 6-7/14-15 vs. expected 3s/7s (new vertical fills from clues); row 6: generated [8,1,7,1,8,1,4,1,8,1,6,1,8,1,9,1,8,8,8,8] vs. expected [8,1,7,1,8,1,4,1,4,1,6,1,8,1,9,1,8,8,8,8] (missing rightward 4 extension); borders remain 1s in generated but are filled over in expected.
 * Train 3: Generated matches input (longer grid with partial 1-borders and seeds like 3/2/9/6/4/7), but expected creates larger blocks—e.g., row 3: generated [8,1,1,3,1,1,8,...1,1,2,1,1,...1,1,9,1,1,...] vs. expected [8,1,1,3,1,1,3,3,3,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,9,1,1,...] (missing 3x3 extensions for 3/2/9); row 6 all 8s in some sections vs. expected 9 in row 6 col 20 (new isolated fill?); rows 13-17: generated partial 6s vs. expected stacked 6s in cols 11-12 (vertical mirroring); row 9: generated [8,8,8,...1,1,6,1,1,...1,1,4,1,1,...] vs. expected [8,8,8,...1,1,6,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,4,1,1,...] (missing 4 extensions); unknown why some seeds like 9 get vertical pillars in rows 13-17 but not others.
 * No functions for blob detection or clue mapping, so attempt couldn't identify or fill shapes; identity function is unhelpful/broken for this problem (don't use it in future—it's just a no-op).
 * All attempts (just this one) ignore clue row influence, leading to missing new shapes (e.g., pillars in empty rows) and no overwriting of 1-borders.
 * Core issue: No recognition of connected components or extension rules, resulting in static output.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is just a copy of the input (identity function), which does not look correct because the input shows partial, unfilled shapes (e.g., row 3: [1,2,2,4,2,2,1,...2,2,9,2,2,1,...] suggests a 2-bordered shape with single 4 and 9 seeds that should be expanded into full blocks of 4s and 9s, possibly 3-wide horizontally like in train examples, and borders overwritten; but generated leaves them partial/singleton). Similarly, row 10: single 6/7/4 seeds inside 2-borders should extend (e.g., to 3x1 or more based on clues), but remain single; row 16: [1,2,2,9,2,2,1,...2,2,5,2,2,1,...2,2,3,2,2,1,...] has multiple single seeds (9,4? wait 4 in row 17? parsing shows partials) that aren't filled, and vertical stacks like rows 15-16 cols 14-18 (2s) aren't extended to match heights in expected patterns. New pillars or mirrors are missing (e.g., potential extensions into all-1 rows 7/13/20, which might be frames to fill with clue numbers like 4/8/9 from bottom row [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]). The bottom clue row in test ([1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]) uses 1s as separators (unlike 8s in training), suggesting a variant where borders are 1s/2s and clues use 1-separators—generated ignores this, leaving no propagation (e.g., no 4/8/9 blocks appearing in upper empty areas). Overall, it looks incomplete and asymmetric, unlike the filled, mirrored expected patterns in training; correct output should have full rectangular fills (e.g., 3x3 for some seeds) and vertical repetitions matching clue sequence.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of Python code that defines a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs, likely identifying patterns, objects, or features in 2D arrays representing visual elements like shapes, holes, or blobs. The code must correctly handle training examples and a test input to produce expected outputs, but the previous attempt failed fundamentally due to missing the required function structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations (training and test) result in errors, preventing any actual processing or output generation.
 * Grids are represented as List[List[int]], where values likely indicate colors, types, or states (e.g., 0 for empty, positive ints for object types), and the puzzle involves extracting or manipulating objects like blobs, holes, or dividers based on connectivity or adjacency rules.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, disconnected components, or keys that don't span the full grid; ensure object extraction considers 4-way or 8-way connectivity to avoid missing subtle merges or separations.
 * Outputs should match expected results for training examples (e.g., classifying or counting features) and generalize to the test input, which may introduce new configurations like asymmetric objects or partial overlaps.
 * All attempts must demonstrate puzzle understanding through correct feature detection (e.g., hole counts, blob shapes), but basic structural errors like missing functions block this entirely.
 * Considerations across attempts: Focus on robust grid traversal (e.g., flood fill for objects), validation of extracted features against puzzle rules, and avoiding assumptions about grid symmetry or uniform object sizes.

# No fully helpful functions from the previous attempt, as it failed at the structural level.
# Skeleton for future: Define a basic 'program' function that takes and processes the grid.
def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> str:  # Assuming output is a string description or classification
    # Implement grid processing here, e.g., extract objects and apply rules
    return "processed output"
```

```python
# Potential helpful extraction function (not from previous attempt, but inferred as essential for object-based puzzles)
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # Use flood fill or DFS/BFS to find connected components (blobs/objects)
    # For each: track position, size, hole_count (enclosed zeros), shape type
    objects = []
    visited = [[False for _ in row] for row in grid]
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):

                hole_count = count_holes(grid, component)  # Subtle: count enclosed empty spaces
                objects.append({"pos": (i,j), "size": len(component), "holes": hole_count})
    return objects

def flood_fill(grid, start_i, start_j, visited):
    # Standard flood fill to collect connected cells of same type
    # Returns list of (i,j) positions in the blob
    pass  # Implement 4-connectivity or 8-connectivity as per puzzle rules

def count_holes(grid, component):
    # Identify and count enclosed regions (subtle: requires boundary detection)
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt generated code without a 'program' function, causing immediate errors in all training examples and the test, with no actual output or processing occurring.
 * Nothing worked: No features were extracted, no rules applied, and the code was structurally invalid for the puzzle evaluator.
 * Everything failed due to the missing core function; this indicates a complete oversight of the basic requirement to structure code around 'program(grid)'.
 * No helpful functions were present or usable, as the code didn't even attempt grid processing—avoid generating raw scripts without the required function wrapper.
 * extract_objects-like functions are essential but absent; future attempts must include them to handle object detection, which seems central to identifying blobs, holes, or dividers.
 * All training examples (1-3) failed identically with the same error, showing no progress or partial understanding.
 * The attempt demonstrates zero grasp of puzzle rules, as no grid analysis was possible.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates no processing happened, so it can't match any expected puzzle solution for the test input grid.
 * Without the 'program' function, the test input (a specific grid) wasn't analyzed, missing opportunities to apply rules like object extraction or pattern matching; this is critically different from expected, as a correct output should describe or classify the test grid's features (e.g., "object with 2 holes" or similar).
 * The error persists across all cases, confirming the test output is invalid and unhelpful; it doesn't account for any puzzle subtleties like unique test configurations (e.g., asymmetric keys or partial objects), which require proper code execution to handle.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating Python code with a specific 'program' function to process inputs, likely grids or patterns, and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case. The goal is to solve the puzzle by iteratively improving the code based on feedback from runs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a function named exactly 'program' to be valid; without it, all runs fail immediately with an error.
 * Inputs appear to be grid-based (e.g., List[List[int]] or similar), and the puzzle involves rules for extracting or manipulating objects like blobs, holes, or shapes in the grid.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or keys that may not span the full grid; mismatches in blob shapes or omissions of specific features (e.g., hole counts, dividers) are common pitfalls.
 * Outputs must match expected results for training examples (which passed or failed in prior attempts, but here all errored) and the test input; mentally simulating grid rules is key to verifying.
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure code handles multiple training examples separately; avoid generating incomplete skeletons; focus on puzzle-specific logic like object extraction after basic structure is in place.

            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming 1s are object pixels
                component = flood_fill(grid, i, j, visited)  # Implement flood fill
                objects.append({'blob': component, 'holes': count_holes(component)})
    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All attempts failed due to the absence of the required 'program' function, resulting in immediate errors for every training example and the test input.
 * No puzzle logic was executed because of the structural error, so nothing worked in terms of solving the visual puzzle rules.
 * Generated code was incomplete or invalid as a whole, preventing any observation of effects like object extraction or output matching.
 * No helpful functions were demonstrated in the attempts, as the code didn't run; future attempts should start with the 'program' skeleton before adding puzzle-specific tools like extract_objects.
 * The function extraction or any grid processing logic is irrelevant until the basic 'program' function is included.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", which does not make sense or look correct because it indicates a fundamental structural failure rather than an attempt to process the test input grid.
 * No actual output was generated for the test input, so it cannot match any expected puzzle solution (e.g., no description of shapes, omissions, or rule applications observed).
 * This error prevents verifying if the code handles test-specific subtleties, like unique grid patterns or edge cases not in training examples; it is completely incorrect and unhelpful for progress.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style polyomino puzzle on a grid, where 1s represent walls or barriers, 8s are background/empty space, and scattered numbers (2-9) in the grid and possibly a clue row at the bottom indicate the required size of connected polyomino regions (orthogonally adjacent cells of the same number must form exactly N cells for a clue N). The task is to resolve and fill ambiguous or partial regions by expanding/connecting same-number cells into complete polyominoes of the exact size, without overlapping walls or background, while leaving walls, background, and the clue row unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are bounded by 1s (walls) and 8s (background); fillings must stay within these enclosures and cannot cross them—treat 1s and 8s as impassable.
 * Each number N must form exactly one or more polyominoes of size exactly N; cells with the same N must connect orthogonally (up/down/left/right, no diagonals) to form these shapes, and no polyomino can be larger or smaller than N.
 * Partial clues (single N cells) need to be expanded by claiming adjacent empty cells (non-1, non-8) to reach size N; if multiple possible expansions, resolve based on fitting all clues without conflict (e.g., don't overclaim space needed for another number).
 * The bottom row (e.g., [8, 2, 8, 3, ...]) acts as a fixed clue legend or seed row—do not modify it; it provides initial N placements that must be expanded upward into the grid.
 * Subtle: Some regions may have multiple clues of the same N, requiring multiple separate polyominoes of size N; avoid merging different Ns or same N across walls. Empty regions without clues might remain 8s or need inference from fitting.
 * Overlapping possibilities: If a region has space for multiple polyominoes, prioritize exact fits; e.g., a clue 7 in a larger space might need to snake or L-shape to fill exactly 7 cells without leaving orphans.
 * Edge cases: Thin corridors (e.g., 1-cell wide) limit shapes; vertical/horizontal stretches must match sizes (e.g., a 2x2 block for 4, not a 1x4 line if it doesn't fit clues). Background 8s in regions might be "empty" but can be filled if needed for polyominoes.
 * All training examples show the bottom clue row unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming it's fixed. Grids vary in width (20, 20, 27 cols across examples), so handle variable dimensions.
 * No diagonals for connectivity; only 4-directional adjacency.
 * If a region has no clues, leave as 8s; if overconstrained (impossible fit), but assuming inputs are solvable.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single prior program used flood-fill on non-background/non-wall cells to identify components, then applied rules like filling with "minority color" if no 1s or filling non-1 cells with the other color if 1s present—but this misinterprets the puzzle as color-based merging rather than size-constrained polyomino expansion.
 * Worked: Correctly detected some connected components (e.g., in Train 1, it kept existing 2s,5s,7s in place without overwriting clues); identified walls (1s) and background (8s) accurately; preserved the bottom clue row unchanged.
 * Didn't work: Ignored polyomino size rules entirely—e.g., filled entire components with one number regardless of size (overfilling 7s as just two cells instead of expanding to seven); treated 1s as "walls to fill around" but didn't use them as boundaries for exact N-shapes; minority/majority logic led to arbitrary fills (e.g., Train 1 row 2 kept 7s as two cells, missing extension to [7,7,7,7,7,7? wait no, expected has three 7s in middle and three on right, but generated only two each).
 * Train 1 differences: Generated missed vertical extensions (e.g., rows 6-8 should have 2s in cols 2-3 and 6s in cols 16-17, but output has all 8s there); row 10 has 3s only in two cells but expected extends to six 3s (cols 1-6); row 14 all 8s/1s but expected has 9s in cols 8-9 and 2s in 16-17; unknown why it didn't expand from bottom clues upward.
 * Train 2 differences: Generated left many areas as 1s or unchanged, e.g., row 2 has 2 and 3 isolated but expected connects 2s across (cols 2 and 4); row 4 all 8s but expected has 3 in col 6; row 6 has 7 and 4 isolated but expected connects 4s (cols 6-8? wait, cols 6 and 8 for 4); row 5 has 3 in col 6 but generated empty; failed to expand bottom clues (e.g., 3,4,6 into vertical polyominoes).
 * Train 3 differences: Similar isolation issues—e.g., row 3 has 3,2,9 as singles but expected expands 3 to cols 3-6 (four 3s?), 2 to cols 11-15 (five 2s?), 9 unchanged? Wait, expected has 3s in 3-6 and 3s in 7-9? No, row 3 expected: 3 at col3, then 1s, but actually expands horizontally/vertically; generated missed most expansions (e.g., row 9 has 6 and 4 isolated, expected connects 6s? and 4s in cols 14-18); rows 13-17 all 8s/6? but generated empty, expected has vertical 6s in col11; bottom expansions ignored entirely.
 * extract_regions (from the program) is helpful for finding bounded areas but broken for polyomino logic—needs integration with clue sizes (don't use raw minority fill). No other functions in the attempt; color_count logic is unhelpful/irrelevant (puzzle isn't about colors, but numbers as sizes—discard it).
 * Overall: Attempt shows basic component detection but zero grasp of Fillomino rules (no size enforcement, no expansion from clues), leading to underfilled grids; bottom clues not propagated upward.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills large rectangular blocks without respecting polyomino sizes (e.g., rows 1-6 have a 5x6 block of 4s, which is 30 cells, but if seeded from a single 4 clue, it should be exactly 4 cells, not 30; similarly, 5-row 9s block is 25 cells, way over size 9). 
 * It treats entire row-spanning areas as single fills (e.g., cols 8-12 as 8s across multiple rows, but 8 is background—should not fill with 8 if claiming for polyominoes; expected likely has smaller, connected shapes like 4-cell 4s snaking around 1s). 
 * Bottom row clues (e.g., 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) are unchanged (good), but no upward expansion visible (e.g., col1 has 4 in bottom, but above it rows 15-20 have 9s/4s/5s/3s, not connected to bottom 4). 
 * Borders of 1s are preserved, but inner empties (implied 8s?) are wrongly uniform-filled, ignoring exact N sizes—e.g., a 5x5 block of 5s would be 25 cells, not size 5; this mismatches Fillomino, where shapes must be exactly N connected cells per clue. 
 * Unknown why it filled with 8s in some blocks (e.g., cols 8-12), as 8 is background—perhaps mistaking empty regions, but expected should fill with numbers from nearby clues or leave empty only if no fit. Overall, it looks like crude region painting, not size-aware polyominoes; to fix, start from each clue position and grow exactly N cells using BFS/possible shapes, resolving conflicts by backtracking or deduction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a 2D array of integers representing colors or fills (1 likely as background/white, 2+ as colored regions, 8 as unknowns/blanks to be resolved, and other numbers like 3-9 as special markers or obstacles). The goal is to transform the grid by applying rules to fill or adjust 8's and possibly other elements based on patterns like bounded regions or connections, ensuring consistency across rows and potentially columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 8's should be filled only if they form internal sequences bounded by the same non-8 color (e.g., >1) on both sides within a row, treating them as part of an extending colored region; however, boundaries must handle edges carefully to avoid assuming a default color like 0.
 * Index bounds are critical: when scanning for left/right non-8 bounds around 8-sequences, the code must prevent out-of-range access (e.g., l < 0 or r >= n), which caused crashes; use safe checks like if l >= 0 before accessing row[l].
 * The puzzle likely involves row-wise processing first, but may require column-wise or global consistency checks, as the grid shows symmetric or repeating patterns (e.g., 2-regions with embedded numbers like 4,6,9 that might act as "seeds" or fixed points not to overwrite).
 * Subtle elements: Embedded numbers (3-9) in colored regions (e.g., 2's) should remain unchanged unless rules specify merging; all-1 rows suggest background filling, but over-filling (e.g., turning everything to 1) ignores colored blobs. 8's might only fill if bounds are strictly same and non-background (not 1). Training errors indicate the need for robust edge cases, like 8's at row starts/ends or isolated 8's.
 * Global considerations: The grid has vertical symmetry and repeating 2-blob structures with varying embedded numbers (e.g., row 3 has 4 and 9 in 2's, row 10 has 6,7,4,9); rules might propagate fills vertically or match patterns across the grid. Deepcopy is useful to avoid mutating input, but ensure the function returns a modified copy.
 * Potential misses: Not handling cases where 8's are adjacent to 1's (background) without a matching bound; ignoring vertical influences (e.g., 8 in row 4 might align with patterns above/below); assuming left_c/right_c >1 without verifying they are actual colors (1 might be invalid for filling).

```
(Note: This function is conceptually helpful for row-wise 8-filling but is currently broken due to potential index errors in bound finding; it could be fixed with better sentinels or conditional access. No other types/tools from attempts, as this is the primary one.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on filling internal 8-sequences in rows bounded by matching colors >1, which aligns with a core rule for resolving blanks in colored regions.
 * What worked: Successfully deepcopy'd the grid to avoid mutation; generated a partial output for the test input without crashing it (unlike training); correctly skipped non-8 cells and identified sequences.
 * What didn't work: Caused "list assignment index out of range" errors in all three training examples, likely due to unsafe access when l < 0 or r >= n during bound finding (e.g., row[l] or row[r] without checks); in test, it failed to fill the 8 in row 4 (position 3: [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]) because left bound (1) != right bound (1? but interrupted by 9), leaving 8 unchanged and not propagating any fills; over-filled some rows to all 1's? Wait, no—the output shows mostly unchanged rows with 8 intact, suggesting the filling condition never triggered properly.
 * The program function simply wraps the fill_eights, which is minimal but doesn't address vertical or multi-pass rules, missing broader puzzle elements like connecting 2-blobs vertically.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., blobs or regions) was attempted, which might be essential for identifying bounded areas globally; this attempt assumes purely row-local rules, ignoring potential column interactions.
 * Training mismatches: All errored out, so no validation; unknown why index errors occurred (possibly training grids have 8's at edges without sentinels), but it demonstrates lack of robustness.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It largely mirrors the input grid (assuming standard input has similar structure), with the 8 in row 4 (0-indexed) remaining unfilled (output shows [1,4,1,8,1,9,...]), and embedded numbers like 9,4,7 unchanged, but no evident filling of 8's despite the rule intent—suggesting the bounding condition failed (left of 8 is 1, right is 1 but with 9 nearby, possibly not matching strictly).
 * Many rows are output as repeating 1's or partial 2-blobs (e.g., row 1: [1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,...] unchanged), which might be correct if no 8's to fill, but the all-1 rows (e.g., rows 0,6,7) look like background preservation; however, later rows like 15-19 show 2-blobs with embedded 9,4,5,3 which remain, indicating no overwriting happened.
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should resolve the 8 to match surrounding pattern (e.g., fill to 1 or extend a color, but based on rules, possibly to 4 if bounded by 4's—though here bounds are 1's); instead, 8 persists, and no vertical consistency (e.g., row 27 mirrors row 4 with 8 and 9's unfilled). This doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as 8's are unresolved blanks; it seems like the code ran but skipped filling due to mismatched bounds or bugs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a Fillomino-style logic puzzle where a grid (with 8s representing empty/unfilled cells, 1s likely acting as boundaries, dividers, or pre-filled non-polyomino cells, and scattered numbers 2-9 as given clues in the bottom row) must be filled such that groups of identical numbers form orthogonally connected polyominoes exactly matching the number's value (e.g., three 3's connected together). The program attempts to automate filling by propagating numbers horizontally into sequences of 8s based on nearby clues or bounds, but it ignores vertical connections, full polyomino validation, and multi-step deduction.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Polyominoes must be exactly the size of the number (e.g., a 5 requires exactly five connected 5's; no more, no less), and same-number polyominoes cannot touch orthogonally even if separate groups.
 * 8s are empty cells to be filled; 1s appear to serve as fixed boundaries or walls that cannot be part of polyominoes (they block horizontal/vertical propagation and remain 1s in outputs).
 * Clues (2-9) are given primarily in the bottom row, separated by 8s, but fillings can extend vertically into upper rows; horizontal-only filling misses cases where polyominoes span rows (e.g., vertical stacks like three 2's in rows 5-7 of train1 expected output).
 * Deduction often requires looking beyond immediate bounds: if a sequence of 8s is bounded by 1s, the fill number comes from the nearest clue (left or right), but only if the sequence length matches or can connect to form the exact polyomino size; over-filling (e.g., assigning a number to a sequence longer/shorter than needed) breaks the rule.
 * Subtle: Some regions remain 8s if they are not part of any clue-based polyomino (e.g., isolated 8s between groups in train1 row2 positions 5-6 stay 8, not filled with 5). Propagation must consider both directions and avoid assuming all 8-sequences are fillable—some are "gaps" between polyominoes.
 * The bottom row (clues) is untouchable (skipped in processing), and the puzzle assumes orthogonal (up/down/left/right) connectivity only—no diagonals.
 * Edge cases: Single-cell clues (rare, but if length=1 bounded by 1s, it may copy the nearest clue directly); long 1-sequences may indicate separate regions; vertical priority over horizontal in conflicts (e.g., train1 rows 5-7 fill vertically with 2's and 6's despite horizontal 8s).
 * All attempts fail to validate polyomino sizes post-filling (e.g., no check if a filled group actually connects to exactly N cells), leading to overfills or wrong numbers.
 * Grids vary in size (20x20 for train1/2, 27x27 for train3), so dimension handling is key, but processing only upper rows (skipping bottom) is correct but insufficient without vertical logic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def get_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
```
(This is a simple, correct utility for getting grid height/width; useful for iteration bounds.)

The main `program` function is an attempt at filling logic but is broken overall (see below); it correctly identifies horizontal 8-sequences but fails on number selection and vertical integration. No other helper functions are provided, but a potential useful addition could be a function to find nearest clue horizontally/vertically:
```python
def find_nearest_clue(g: List[List[int]], row: int, col: int, direction: str) -> int:
    # Example stub: search left/right/up/down from (row, col) for first 2-9, skipping 1s and 8s
    # Return 0 if none found
    pass
```
(This is conceptual; not in the attempt but would help for better propagation than the attempt's buggy left/right search.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and skips the bottom clue row, uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input, and properly detects horizontal sequences of 8s bounded by non-8s (e.g., correctly fills the two 2's in train1 row2/3 bounded by 1s, matching expected).
 * It works for simple cases where a horizontal 8-sequence is directly bounded by matching clues >1 (e.g., partial matches in train1 for 7's in row2/3), and sometimes picks the right number from left/right when bounded by 1s (e.g., 3's in train9/10).
 * However, it fails to handle vertical propagation entirely—no code for checking/connecting across rows, leading to misses like the vertical 2's and 6's in train1 rows5-7 (generated keeps 8s, expected fills them) and vertical 6's in train3 rows13-17 (generated all 8s, expected 6's in col11).
 * Bug in bound detection: The left/right bound finding loops incorrectly extend bounds if adjacent 8s (e.g., in train1 row2, it over-extends left/right for the 5-clue area, filling positions 5-6 with 5's where expected 8,8 as a gap).
 * Flawed 1-bounded logic: When bounded by 1s, it prefers left clue but only if left 1-sequence length==1, else right— this is arbitrary and wrong (e.g., in train1 row9, it picks 9 for a sequence that should be 3 from left, and fills 6's correctly but in wrong spot; in train2 row2, it leaves 3's as 1's instead of filling adjacent 8? Wait, input unclear but generated has 1,2,1,2 instead of expected 1,2,1,2 but misses later 3/8).
 * In train3, it fills upper horizontal groups (e.g., 3's and 2's in row3) but completely ignores lower vertical stacks (e.g., expected 6's in rows13-17 col11 stay 8s; expected 4's in row9 col14-16 become wrong 6,1,1 or similar—mismatch in positioning).
 * Over-filling issue: Fills sequences longer than the clue (e.g., train1 row9 fills four 9's? but clue is 9, yet expected uses 3's instead, suggesting vertical or size mismatch not checked).
 * The while-loop for sequence detection skips non-8 cells correctly but doesn't revisit after filling (no iterative propagation), so partial fills don't trigger further changes (e.g., train2 misses filling after initial 8's to 3/4).
 * Function `program` is partially helpful for horizontal detection but broken for full solving (don't reuse without vertical logic and validation); the inner left/right clue search is unhelpful/buggy as it skips 1s but doesn't search vertically or validate size.
 * All training examples incorrect: Train1 mismatches in filled gaps (e.g., extra 5's/9's where 8's/3's expected) and misses verticals; Train2 mismatches in partial horizontals (e.g., generated 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,3 but expected 1,2,1,2,1,3,1,8 and vertical 3/4/6/7/9 in row4/6); Train3 mismatches in verticals (e.g., no 6's or 4's in lower rows) and some horizontals (e.g., row9 has 6,1,1,6,6,6 but expected 6,1,1,4,4,4).
 * Unknown reasons for some mismatches (e.g., why train1 row10 fills 8,8,8 with 6's correctly but row9 overfills 9's—possibly bound detection error in while l >=0 and g[i][l]==8).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-fills nearly the entire grid with groups of five 2's (e.g., rows2-6 have long horizontal 2,2,2,2,2 sequences bounded by 1s), but this ignores clue sizes in the bottom row (e.g., clues like 4,9,4,7,6,9 require exact polyominoes of those sizes, not all 2's; a group of five 2's would need to be part of ten 2's total for validity, but no such connection exists).
 * It treats borders as all 1s (e.g., row0 all 1s, many rows starting/ending with 1s), suggesting the input had 8s replaced indiscriminately, but expected should leave gaps as 1s or 8s and form vertical/horizontal polyominoes matching bottom clues (e.g., a 9-clue should have nine connected 9's spanning rows, not scattered 2's or 9's in single positions like row3 col22).
 * Wrong numbers in key spots: e.g., row17 has 2,2,9,2,2 but a 9 should connect to eight more 9's (not isolated); row18 has scattered higher numbers (9,4,2,2,5,2,2,3,2,2) that don't form valid polyominoes (e.g., single 9 can't be valid). This indicates the horizontal-only logic failed on a larger/wider grid (29 cols?), creating artificial 1-boundaries and ignoring vertical needs.
 * To handle test, must add vertical search/propagation and size validation (e.g., after filling a group, count connected same-number cells == number value).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a Fillomino-style logic puzzle on a grid with walls (cells marked 1, which block regions), clue cells (numbers 2-9 indicating the exact size of the connected region that cell belongs to), and empty cells (marked 8, to be filled with numbers 2-9 such that all connected cells sharing the same number form a polyomino of exactly that size, without crossing walls or clues mismatched to their regions). The goal is to deduce and fill all 8s logically based on clues and constraints, ensuring no region violates size rules, clues are satisfied, and the grid is fully resolved without isolated cells or overflows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (1s) act as barriers; regions cannot connect across or include 1s, and 1s themselves are not part of any numbered region.
 * Clues (2-9) must be the starting point for a region of exactly that many connected cells ( orthogonally adjacent, no diagonals), all filled with the same number as the clue; no two different clues can be in the same region unless they match in value and size constraints.
 * Empty cells (8s) must be filled to extend regions logically; single-cell regions are impossible since clues start at 2, so all 8s must connect to existing clues or form new regions only if deducible (but typically all connect back to clues).
 * Horizontal and vertical fillings must consider adjacent clues and skipped walls (1s between sequences of 8s), but cannot assume fills without verifying total region size; over-filling (e.g., long chains of the same number exceeding the clue value) violates rules.
 * Special cases for all-8 rows: These may need targeted filling based on bottom clues (e.g., if a specific clue like bottom[13]==9 triggers patterns), but must avoid assuming offsets without bounds checking; even/odd indexing for offsets risks skipping or duplicating fills.
 * Subtle deduction rules: When 8s are bounded by clues on left/right (or up/down), fill with the matching clue if sizes align (e.g., equal clues with no/minimal skipped 1s); if unequal, prefer the closer/bounding clue or use length of 8s sequence to decide (e.g., short sequences like length=1 or 2 favor smaller/nearer clues, but only if total region won't exceed); symmetric cases (equal skipped 1s) require checking sequence length against clue (e.g., length=3 with 1 skipped might take max/min based on puzzle norms).
 * Avoid naive fills: Do not fill entire sequences of 8s with a single number without counting total connected cells (including vertical/horizontal extensions); this can create oversized regions (e.g., five 2s in a row is invalid for size 2).
 * Grid structure: Clues often in bottom/top rows separated by 1s; upper grid has blocks of 1s (solid walls) and open areas with 8s; fills must propagate across rows/columns without leaving isolated 8s.
 * Edge cases: Zero skipped 1s allows direct propagation from one side; multiple skipped 1s (e.g., 1 or 2) may block or weight toward one clue; clues like 9 may indicate large regions spanning multiple rows.
 * Full resolution: Program must iterate fills (horizontal then vertical, possibly multiple passes) until no 8s remain; partial fills (leftover 8s) indicate incomplete logic.
 * No diagonals or wrapping; regions are strictly orthogonal polyominoes.

    # (Implementation as in attempt, but note: similar partial logic issues)
    # ...
    return g
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `fill_all8_rows`: Broken due to index out of range errors (e.g., accessing offset_cols[ii-1] when ii exceeds len(offset_cols), or assuming fixed indices like g[h-2][13]==9 without grid validation); overly specific to unconfirmed patterns (e.g., even/odd ii for offsets +3 from clues); does not generally help deduce regions and causes crashes—remove or heavily refactor.
 * No region size validation function: All attempts lack a post-fill check to ensure no region exceeds its number (critical flaw); without this, fills are speculative and invalid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (no prior ones detailed) focused on horizontal/vertical filling of 8 sequences bounded by clues, with heuristics for unequal clues (prefer nearer/bounding, adjust by skipped 1s and sequence length) and special all-8 row handling, but failed entirely on training examples due to index errors in `fill_all8_rows` (out of range on offset_cols and fixed [13] access, likely from assuming clue positions without bounds checks).
 * What worked: For the test input, it successfully ran without error and filled many 8s into 2s (e.g., horizontal stretches of five 2s in multiple rows, like rows 1-5 and 8-11), and placed some higher numbers (e.g., 4 at [3][3], 9 at [3][22], 6 at [10][3], 7 at [10][10], 4 at [10][22], 9 at [11][22], 2s extended in lower sections like rows 15-20 with added 9/4/5/3 placements); this shows basic detection of 8 sequences and clue propagation for small/default fills (2s as fallback?).
 * What didn't work: Training examples 1-3 all crashed with "list assignment index out of range" (likely in `fill_all8_rows` when computing/iterating offset_cols or accessing g[h-2][13] on smaller/variable grids); no training passes, indicating non-robust code. For test, filling is incomplete (e.g., row 27 still has an 8 at position 3), and logic is flawed—long horizontal 2-runs (e.g., five connected 2s in row 1 cols 1-5) create invalid regions (size 5 > 2, violating Fillomino rules); vertical connections (e.g., stacked 2s across rows 1-5 in col 1) would compound to even larger invalid regions. Heuristics for fill_n (e.g., taking max/min for length=3 with skipped=1, or preferring left if skipped_left < skipped_right) are ad-hoc and over-aggressive, ignoring total region size; symmetric cases (equal clues/skipped) have inconsistent rules (e.g., min vs max in vertical vs horizontal). No iteration for propagating fills across directions, leaving deductions partial. `fill_all8_rows` contributed nothing useful here (no all-8 rows filled specially, and it may have skipped due to conditions like g[h-2][13]==9 not met).
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates partial grasp of bounding clues and sequence filling but misses core region validation, leading to invalid outputs; errors prevent any training success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially filled the grid (e.g., upper blocks like rows 1-6 and 8-13 have patterns of 1s separating stretches of five 2s, with isolated higher numbers like 4/9/6/7 inserted; lower sections rows 15-20 mirror this with 2s and 5/3/9/4; solid 1-rows at 0,6-7,13-14,20-21,25-26,28 act as barriers) but does not look correct overall.
 * Issues: Many 2-fills create oversized regions (e.g., row 1: 2s at cols 1-5 connect horizontally to size 5 >2; vertically, col 1 has 2s in rows 1-5,8-11,15-20 stacking to size 15+ >2, invalid); this suggests the program defaulted to 2s for unknown/bounded 8s without size checks. Higher placements (e.g., 9 at row 3 col 22, 5 at row 17 col 16) might align with nearby clues (bottom row has 9s/5s), but without full connectivity check, they could be wrong (e.g., if the 9-region doesn't reach size 9). Incomplete: Row 27 retains an 8 (at col 3, between 4 and 1,9 clues), meaning deduction failed there—likely needs vertical propagation from above or better bounding logic. Expected output should have no 8s left, all regions exactly matching their number (e.g., 2s only in isolated domino pairs, 9s in nonominoes connecting to clue positions), and no overflows; this output violates that by over-filling 2s and leaving gaps, so it mismatches a correct resolution (difference likely due to lack of region counting and multi-pass deduction).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a region-filling puzzle on a grid where 1's serve as impassable boundaries (walls), 8's are empty cells to be filled, and clue numbers (2-9) are seeds placed within regions; the goal is to identify each connected region (4-way adjacent non-1 cells) bounded by 1's or grid edges, and fill all 8's in that region with the single clue number (2-9) present in it, leaving single-cell regions (like bottom-row clues separated by 8's) unchanged except for their clue.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) groups of 8's and exactly one clue per region; filling must propagate the clue to all connected 8's within the boundaries, even for non-rectangular or L-shaped regions spanning multiple rows/columns.
 * 1's block propagation entirely and are never changed; 8's on the grid edges or outside regions may remain 8's if not part of a fillable region.
 * Bottom row typically contains isolated single-cell regions with clues (2-9) separated by 8's, which stay as-is (clue in place, adjacent 8's unfilled since they may be boundaries or separate).
 * Assume exactly one clue (2-9) per region; no overwriting of existing clues or handling multiple clues per region (puzzle validity assumes this).
 * Propagation must handle vertical, horizontal, and turning connections (e.g., a clue in one row filling adjacent columns in another row); straight-line run filling alone misses complex shapes.
 * Iterative passes (horiz then vert) can approximate propagation but fail if not checking connectivity fully, as runs may not align with region bounds (e.g., bounded by 1's instead of matching clues).
 * Unfilled 8's in generated outputs often indicate missed vertical propagation or regions bounded by 1's (not same >1 clues).
 * Clues like 2-9 in bottom row do not propagate upward unless connected through a region (rarely, as they are isolated).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 20x20 in ex1-2, 27x27? in ex3), with borders often all-8 rows/columns that remain 8's.
 * Subtle: Some regions span multiple rows but are vertically bounded by 1's (e.g., rows 2-3 only), so no spillover to adjacent all-8 rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The previous attempt's `get_dimensions` is useful for getting grid size. No other functions from the attempt are helpful, as the core logic (run-based filling) is flawed for regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt used iterative (20 passes) horizontal and vertical run-filling: finds consecutive 8's in a row/column, extends to find bounding cells, and fills the run only if bounds are identical numbers >1; this worked partially for straight horizontal runs adjacent to clues >1 (e.g., ex1 row2 cols2-3 filled as 2,2; cols8-9 as 5,5; cols15-16 as 7,7; ex2 row2 col2=2 single; ex3 row3 col3=3 single, col11=2 single).
 * Failed completely for regions bounded by 1's (not >1 clues), leaving runs of 8's unfilled (e.g., ex1 row2 cols11-13 stayed 8,8,8 instead of 7,7,7 from a nearby 7 clue in the same row-bounded region; ex3 row3 cols6-8 stayed 1,1,1? but expected 3,3,3 from horizontal propagation within 1-bounded region).
 * Missed all vertical propagation into all-8 areas adjacent to filled rows (e.g., ex1 rows5-7 cols2-3 stayed 8's instead of 2,2; rows5-7 cols15-16 stayed 8's instead of 6,6; ex2 row4 col2 stayed 8 instead of 3; row6 col4-5 stayed 1,4,1? but expected 4,4 from vertical; ex3 rows13-17 col11 stayed 8's? but expected 6's vertically).
 * Did not handle region connectivity across turns/corners (e.g., ex1 row9 cols5-6=3,3 filled horizontally, but if vertically connected, would miss; ex3 row9 cols16-18=4,4,4 expected but gen missed vertical from row10? gen row10 has 1,1,6,1,1 but no full fill).
 * Bottom row clues stayed correctly unfilled around them (e.g., all examples kept isolated 2-9 with surrounding 8's as 8's), as bounds were 8's or edges (condition left_c == right_c >1 not met).
 * Worked for some isolated singles (e.g., ex2 row2 col6=3; ex3 row3 col20=9), but over-relied on bounds matching clues, ignoring 1-bounded regions.
 * Function `fill_horizontal` and `fill_vertical` are broken for this puzzle: they only fill straight runs bounded by matching >1 clues, useless for 1-bounded or multi-direction regions (do not use in future; replace with flood fill).
 * `program` iteration helped propagate some chained horizontal fills but stalled on vertical or bounded cases (e.g., ex1 filled initial 2's/5's/7's but no further).
 * Ex1: Generated mismatched 7's (cols11-13 row2-3=8's vs expected 7's; cols13 row2=8 vs 7; vertical 2's/6's in rows5-7=8's vs expected filled; row9 cols5-6=3,3 correct but row10 cols5-6=3,3 correct? wait gen row10=1,3,3,1 correct; row13 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 9,9?; row14 cols15-16=2,2 correct but reason unknown).
 * Ex2: Mismatched vertical fills (row4 col2=8 vs 3; row4 col10=8 vs 6; row4 col14=8 vs 7; row6 cols4-5=1,4,1? gen 1,4,1 but expected 4,4 vertical from row6 col4=4 seed?; row2 col4=8 vs 2).
 * Ex3: Mismatched horizontal extensions in 1-bounded regions (row3 cols3=3 single vs extended 3's at cols6-8; row9 cols16-18=1,1,1? vs 4,4,4; vertical 6's in rows13-17 col11=8's vs expected 6's; row6 col20=8 vs 9; row18-22 cols20-22=8's vs 7?).
 * `deepcopy` is helpful to avoid mutating input but irrelevant to core logic failure.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrated partial understanding of line-filling but zero grasp of full region flood fill, leading to all training failures; no extraction functions present, but one could be added for regions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows excessive horizontal filling with 2's in long runs bounded by 1's (e.g., row1 cols1-5=2's, row3 cols1-3=2's and cols5-6=2's around a 4 seed without overwriting or unifying the region, row10 cols1-5=2's, row16 cols1-5=2's and cols14-18=2's around 2's but with 5 at col16, row18 cols1-3=2's around 9/4 but kept separate), which suggests the run-filling logic applied blindly without checking region clues or vertical connections.
 * It preserves seeds like 4 (row3 col3), 9 (row3 col22), 6 (row10 col3), 7 (row10 col11), but fills adjacent 8's with 2's incorrectly if those seeds define different regions (e.g., row3 has 4 and 9 isolated but surrounded by 2-fills, implying wrong clue propagation; likely the 2's come from nearby seeds, but verticals like row16-17 cols14-18=2's may miss extensions from row18's 3/5/etc.).
 * Bottom row (row27?) has [1,4,1,8,1,9,...] with 1's as bounds? but fills none around singles, which is partially correct for isolation but wrong if any vertical regions exist above; overall, it looks like partial horizontal fills without full region awareness, leaving potential vertical/mixed connections (e.g., row8 all 1's? vs possible bounds, row15 all 1's) unfilled or mismatched—does not match puzzle rules, as regions with clues like 3/5/7 in row18 should fill connected 8's above/beside, not default to 2's.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the goal is to identify background, detect framed blocks containing inner colored regions, extract a sequence of colors from a key row at the bottom, match inners to that sequence, and connect consecutive matched inners with paths of their color—horizontally within blocks and vertically between blocks, including shifting rows for multi-connection gaps. The output is the modified grid with these connections filled in, preserving the original structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the entire grid; all other colors represent objects, frames, or keys.
 * Blocks are vertical stacks of at least 2 consecutive non-background rows; they represent framed regions, and frames are detected as the dominant non-background color in uniform rows within a block (fallback to most frequent non-bg).
 * Inner regions are contiguous horizontal runs of the same non-background, non-frame color within blocks; these are merged vertically if they align in x-range and color, forming rectangular inners.
 * The key row is the bottommost row (scanning downward) with 3-12 isolated runs of non-background cells (total non-bg <=15), treated as single-cell colors in left-to-right order to form the sequence.
 * Inners are assigned to the sequence by matching colors, preferring leftmost unused inner for duplicates.
 * Connections: Horizontal gaps between same-block inners are filled directly if adjacent in x; vertical connections between different blocks use overlapping x-ranges in the gap rows between blocks, but for height-2 gaps with multiple connections, shift the lower block up by 1 row, fill the new single gap row with all connections (overlapping fills), and update positions.
 * Subtleties: Vertical plans only fill if x-overlap exists and gap rows are available; after shifts, remaining verticals are filled straightforwardly. Assume singles in key row (skip one after each non-bg). Fallback key row is h-2 if no match. No diagonal or non-rectangular fills. Preserve bg in fills only if empty.
 * Edge cases: No inners or short sequence skips output. Blocks sorted by y_start. Global updates for shifts affect blocks, key_row, and lower plans. Height-2 multi-conn shifts only bottom-to-top processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) implements a full pipeline for detecting bg, blocks, frames, inners, key row/sequence, assignment, and connections (horizontal direct, vertical with height-2 shift for multiples), but fails entirely due to a Python syntax error: "global key_row" is declared after key_row is used (in the shift logic), causing execution errors in all training examples and test.
 * What worked: Core detection functions (bg, blocks, inners, key row, sequence, assignment) appear logically sound based on puzzle rules; horizontal fills and basic vertical fills would likely work if executed; shift logic attempts to handle multi-connections in tight gaps by inserting space via row shift.
 * What didn't work: The global declaration bug crashes everything before any output; no actual grid modifications occur, so all results are errors instead of grids. Key row update in shifts uses global but is post-use. Assumes single-cell key entries (j +=1 after append), which may miss multi-cell keys. Vertical x-overlap is max(start)-min(end), which could be empty if no overlap. No handling for same-color inners in different blocks without vertical gaps. Fallback frame detection may pick inners as frame if no uniform rows.
 * The main program structure is helpful for future but needs bug fixes; inner extraction via temp_inners and grouping is essential for merging rectangles.
 * No prior attempts, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of sequencing and connections but zero execution success.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error, not a grid, so it does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution; expected is a modified grid with connections filled, but nothing generates due to the crash.
 * Specifically, the error prevents any observation of whether detections (e.g., inners, sequence) or fills (e.g., horizontals, verticals with shifts) work for the test input; without running, we can't confirm if the logic would produce correct paths (e.g., if test has height-2 multi-conns needing shift, or non-overlapping verticals to skip).
 * The error output is identical across all examples, indicating the bug is universal and blocks all progress; test likely needs the shift logic (if multi-conns present) or basic verticals, but we can't verify differences from expected without fixed execution—assume incorrect until fixed and outputs grids.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (often 8 or 1) and colored components that form incomplete frames or outlines enclosing small inner regions; the goal is to fill gaps between adjacent or overlapping frames with a specific color chosen based on isolated color markers at the bottom of the grid, effectively completing symmetric or connected shapes while preserving the overall structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is typically the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training examples 1-3, 1 in the test); all fills must only overwrite bg cells, never existing colors.
 * Bottom isolates are single non-bg cells in the bottom row (or near-bottom) flanked by bg on both sides; there must be at least 3 such isolates in a row to be valid, and their positions (indexed from 1) and colors guide color selection for fills via adjacency rules (e.g., choose the color whose position is minimal in adjacent pairs).
 * Frames are medium-sized connected components (5-50 cells) of a single color (frame_color, chosen as the color with the most such components); these enclose 1-8 cell inner regions of a different color, which must be identified within the frame's bounding box.
 * Fills occur between pairs of frames that overlap in one dimension (rows for horizontal pairs, columns for vertical) with a small gap (1-3 bg cells); the fill color is selected from the two inner colors based on bottom isolate adjacency, and fills only the gap rows/columns using the union or range from the inners.
 * Subtlety: Horizontal pairs fill specific rows from the union of inner colored rows; vertical pairs fill specific columns from the chosen inner's range; gaps must be exactly between frames without full overlap or large separations.
 * Overlapping frames must share the overlap dimension but have a gap in the other; inners must be exactly one per frame and small (1-8 cells) to qualify.
 * Easy to miss: Frame_color selection prioritizes medium components but may fail if multiple colors qualify; bottom isolates are only considered if >=3 in a single row; fills don't extend beyond the gap or overwrite non-bg; the bottom row itself has scattered single-color isolates (1-9) that aren't filled but guide the logic.
 * Components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right); visited tracking prevents revisiting in inner extraction.
 * Puzzle assumes a single frame_color; if none found, return unchanged grid.
 * Test input has wider grid (29 cols) and more complex nesting; bg=1, main fill color seems 2 with outliers (3-9); fills must respect multiple levels of frames.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies bg (e.g., 8 or 1) and frame_color via medium component count, and extracts bottom isolates only if >=3 in a row, which works for qualifying valid rows in all training examples.
 * find_components and identify_outers are helpful and correctly find frames/inners (e.g., detects small inners like the 7's in train1 row2-3, 2's in train2 row2-3), but pairing logic in get_pairs fails to detect all overlaps/gaps (e.g., misses horizontal overlap for 7's in train1 rows2-4 cols11-17, where gap=0 but should fill via adjacency).
 * What worked: Some vertical fills partially succeed, like extending 3's and 4's in train1 rows9-11/14-16, but incompletely (e.g., train1 row10 col5-6 filled as 3 but expected full extension); bottom isolate adjacency selection works for simple cases but ignores non-adjacent colors.
 * What didn't: No fills applied in many gap areas, leaving bg (8 or 1) where expected colors propagate (e.g., train1: rows2-4 cols11-13/15-17 remain 8 instead of 7; rows5-7 cols2-3/16-17 remain 8 instead of 2/6; row10 cols1-5/7 remain 8 instead of 3; row13 cols8-9 remain 8 instead of 9; row15 cols11-14 remain 8 instead of 4).
 * Train1 differences: Generated misses horizontal fills for 2 (rows5-7 cols2-3), 6 (rows5-7 cols16-17), 9 (row13 cols8-9), and partial 3/4 extensions; also no vertical fill for 7's across cols11-17 in rows2-4; bottom row unchanged correctly, but isolates not fully guiding all pairs.
 * Train2 differences: Generated misses fills like 2 in row2 col4/row3 col2 (expected 2 extensions); 3 in row4 col6/row6 col2? Wait, row4 is all bg except isolates, but expected 3 at row4 col6; row6 col4-5 as 4 but generated bg; row7 col4 as 4 but generated 1? No, generated has some 4/6 but misses 5 extensions in row7 col10-11? Unknown why partial—perhaps overlap check fails for vertical pairs.
 * Train3 differences: Generated has almost no fills beyond existing (e.g., misses 2 extensions in row3 cols11-15 to 2; 4 in row9 cols14-16/20-21? row10 col19-21 as 4 but generated bg; vertical 6 in rows12-16 col11 as 6 but generated bg; 9 in row6 col19 as 9 but generated bg; row18-22 almost unchanged, missing 8? fills); wider grid causes bbox issues, with inners not paired due to gap>3 or no overlap.
 * get_pairs is broken for vertical fills (e.g., fill_cols from chosen_o only, but should union or extend; overlap_check uses wrong indices for vertical); apply_fills only fills if bg but doesn't handle multi-row/col properly.
 * find_bottom_isolates is helpful but too strict (only one row checked, misses multi-row bottoms in test); get_all_pos correctly maps colors to positions but assumes single row.
 * Overall, attempt understands frame/inner extraction and bottom-guided color choice but fails on pair detection (gaps/overlaps) and fill application (wrong ranges/union), leading to under-filling; no over-filling observed.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it primarily fills large areas with 2 (e.g., rows1-6/8-13/15-? cols1-6/8-13/21-25 as 2, matching some inner 2's) but leaves many bg=1 cells unfilled where extensions are needed (e.g., row3 col6-7/13-? should extend 4/8/9 but remain 1; row10 col3-6/21-24 should extend 6/4 but partial/missing; row17-20 cols14-20/22-25 have some 2 but miss 5/3 extensions like row18 col17 as 5→full row? ; bottom row22-26 have 3/7 but no upward fills to connect).
 * It over-fills some 2 areas beyond frames (e.g., row15-16 cols14-20 as 2, but input has no inner there—perhaps false pair); ignores isolates like 8/9/4/7/6/9/4/5/3/7, only using adjacent for partial 2/4 fills, missing vertical propagations (e.g., no 6 fill in col11 rows8-14).
 * Makes sense for simple horizontal 2 fills but not for complex vertical/nested (e.g., row18 has 9/4/5/3 but no fills above); likely pairing misses small gaps or wrong overlap, leaving ~70% of expected fills undone; to handle test, need better multi-row bottom scan and union fills for vertical pairs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing a 2D structure like a cave or channel system) with 0s (empty space or background), 1s (walls or barriers), and numbered values representing colored blocks or components. The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, classifying them as "bottom" (near the grid's bottom edge) or "upper" blocks, pairing them by color and position, grouping into channels based on column overlaps, and then modifying the grid (e.g., filling or connecting channels between paired blocks) to produce an output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed by same-color cells (values != 0 and != 1), using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections are not considered.
 * Bottom blocks are specifically those whose maximum row (max_r) reaches n-2 (second-to-last row), suggesting the puzzle treats the very last row (n-1) as a special boundary (e.g., floor or outflow), not part of blocks.
 * Upper blocks are all non-bottom blocks not touching that near-bottom level; this implies a vertical layering where blocks are stacked or separated by rows.
 * Pairing happens by color, sorting both upper and bottom lists by minimum column (min_c) to match left-to-right order; this assumes blocks don't overlap in complex ways and that column position indicates correspondence.
 * Channels are groups of upper blocks whose column ranges overlap (max(min_c) <= min(max_c)), suggesting horizontal "tunnels" or paths; channels are assigned IDs incrementally and sorted internally by min_r (top-to-bottom stacking).
 * The program must return a modified copy of the grid (using deepcopy), but the current implementation doesn't apply any fills/connections—it just identifies structures and returns the unchanged grid, which is incomplete.
 * Subtlety: Block bounds (min_r/max_r, min_c/max_c) are computed via flood-fill (DFS with stack), which correctly handles irregular shapes but assumes colors don't mix (same color only).
 * Grid dimensions: n rows, m columns; assumes rectangular input, no empty rows/columns.
 * Potential misses: No handling for single-cell blocks, multi-block channels with gaps, or colors with unequal upper/bottom counts (pairing takes min length, ignoring extras). No actual grid modification (e.g., filling paths between paired blocks with a specific value like color or 2). Errors arise from undefined 'g' in helper functions (scoping issue: helpers use len(g) but g is only in program(); need to pass grid or use n/m from blocks).
 * All training and test runs failed due to execution errors, so no actual outputs to verify against expected puzzle results (e.g., filled channels or connected paths).

    n = len(g)
    return [b for b in blocks if b['max_r'] == n - 2]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided identifies connected components correctly via flood-fill but fails to execute due to scoping errors ('g' undefined in helpers like get_bottom_blocks, get_upper_blocks, and identify_channels, which reference len(g) without passing g).
 * What worked: find_special_blocks properly extracts blocks with bounds and color; pairing logic (pair_blocks_by_color) sensibly matches by color and sorted columns; channel grouping (identify_channels) handles overlaps via nested loops.
 * What didn't work: No grid modification—returns deepcopy without applying puzzle logic (e.g., filling channels between pairs); all runs (training 1-3, test) errored with "name 'g' is not defined", producing no outputs instead of modified grids. get_bottom_blocks and get_upper_blocks are incomplete/broken (rely on unpassed g; upper_blocks filters vaguely with len(g)-2). pair_blocks_by_color assumes min_c for sorting but ignores block widths (may mispair wide blocks). identify_channels assigns incremental IDs but doesn't use them for output; loop inefficiency for large channels.
 * get_upper_blocks is not helpful (vague filter, broken scoping; better to derive from blocks without g).
 * No training or test outputs generated, so cannot verify if block extraction matches expected (e.g., correct component counts or bounds); differences unknown but likely irrelevant since no modification occurs.
 * Function get_bottom_blocks is partially helpful for bottom detection but broken (fix by passing n); pair_blocks_by_color is useful for matching but may fail on non-singleton blocks (uses min_c only).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("name 'g' is not defined"), not a valid grid; this does not make sense or look correct, as the puzzle requires a modified List[List[int]] output, likely with filled channels or connections (e.g., propagating color from bottom to upper pairs along non-overlapping paths, avoiding walls=1).
 * No actual grid produced, so it mismatches any expected test solution (e.g., if test has specific color flows, nothing is filled); errors prevent checking if block identification is accurate for test input.
 * To handle test case, must fix scoping (pass grid or dimensions to helpers) and implement grid fills (e.g., for each pair, fill vertical/horizontal paths in channels with color or a fill value, respecting 1s as barriers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains colored blocks (numbers 1-9 representing colors) separated by background (bg, often 8 or 1), with a legend sequence in the second-to-last row indicating an order to connect consecutive colored blocks by filling straight-line gaps (horizontal or vertical) between them using the color of the starting block in each pair, effectively merging or extending blocks to form paths or shapes matching the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend sequence is extracted from non-bg cells in the second-to-last row (n-2), representing the order of colors to connect (e.g., connect first available block of color A to first of B, then B to C, etc.).
 * Connections only fill background gaps in straight horizontal or vertical lines between bounding boxes of consecutive blocks if they align on the same row(s) or column(s); no diagonal or complex path filling.
 * Multiple blocks per color exist (e.g., several disconnected 2's), so they must be processed in positional order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting by min_r then min_c) using a queue to select the "next" available block for connection.
 * Fill only bg cells; do not overwrite existing non-bg cells, and fills should merge blocks without expanding beyond the gap between bboxes.
 * Background is always the top-left cell's value (e.g., 8 in training, 1 in test); legend skips bg in extraction.
 * Subtle: Connections may chain across the sequence, so popping/using blocks in order can leave later blocks unconnected if wrong pairs are chosen; some expected outputs show horizontal fills spanning multiple columns (e.g., 7's connecting across in ex1 row 2-3) or vertical extensions.
 * Easy to miss: Not all blocks of a color are connected in every step—only consecutive in sequence; leftover blocks remain unchanged. Also, bboxes must be precise (min/max r/c of connected components via flood-fill/DFS/stack).
 * Grids have frame-like 1's in some cases (e.g., outlining shapes), which should not be filled into unless part of a connection.
 * In test case, bg=1 acts as both frame and separator, so fills must distinguish carefully to avoid merging unintended areas.
 * Sequence length is len(legend)-1 connections; process sequentially without revisiting.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills entire row/col spans between bboxes, but if bboxes don't perfectly align (e.g., partial overlap), it may fill extra or miss (e.g., ex1 misses 5-to-7 horizontal merge).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg from top-left; essential and works in all cases.)

```python
def extract_legend(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    return [g[n-2][c] for c in range(m) if g[n-2][c] != bg]
```
(This accurately pulls the sequence from row n-2, skipping bg; works perfectly in examples, e.g., ex1 seq=[2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5].)

```python
def find_connected_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])

                col = g[r][c]
                min_r = max_r = r
                min_c = max_c = c
                stack = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    rr, cc = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, rr)
                    max_r = max(max_r, rr)
                    min_c = min(min_c, cc)
                    max_c = max(max_c, cc)
                    for dr, dc in dirs:
                        nr = rr + dr
                        nc = cc + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] == col:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                blocks[col].append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return blocks
```
(This flood-fills to find connected components and their bounding boxes correctly; essential for identifying blocks, works in all cases without errors.)

```python
def sort_blocks_by_position(blocks: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]]:
    for col in blocks:
        blocks[col] = sorted(blocks[col], key=lambda bbox: (bbox[0], bbox[2]))
    return blocks
```
(This sorts bboxes per color by top row then left col, enabling queue-based "first available" selection; helpful and correct, but may need refinement for multi-block ordering.)

```python
def fill_horizontal_gap(g: List[List[int]], left_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], right_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], fill_col: int, bg: int) -> None:
    min_r = left_bbox[0]
    max_r = left_bbox[1]
    start_c = left_bbox[3] + 1
    end_c = right_bbox[2]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(start_c, end_c):
            if g[r][c] == bg:
                g[r][c] = fill_col

def fill_vertical_gap(g: List[List[int]], up_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], down_bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int], fill_col: int, bg: int) -> None:
    min_c = up_bbox[2]
    max_c = up_bbox[3]
    start_r = up_bbox[1] + 1
    end_r = down_bbox[0]
    for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
        for r in range(start_r, end_r):
            if g[r][c] == bg:
                g[r][c] = fill_col
```
(These fill straight gaps correctly if bboxes align, using start color; helpful but limited—only works for perfect row/col alignment, misses partial overlaps or non-straight needs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core connection logic is flawed despite good block detection.
 * Ex1 generated: Connected some 1-5 and 1-7 vertically/horizontally in upper sections (e.g., filled 1's around 2/5/7), but missed key horizontal merges like 5-to-7 in rows 2-3 (generated has separate 5's and 7's; expected connects 7's across cols 11-16 with 7 fills), 1-to-3 in rows 9-10 (generated leaves gap; expected fills 3's into col5-6), and bottom 4-to-2 (generated no fill; expected 4's extend to col13-16). Also, row12 has 9's but no connection to prior. Unknown why 7's didn't merge—possibly wrong bbox pairing or alignment check.
 * Ex2 generated: Filled some vertical 1's and 7's (e.g., row6 col2/4/6/8/10/12/14 with 7's? But output shows partial), but missed horizontal extensions like 3 in row4 col6 (expected isolated but connected? Wait, expected has 3 in row4 col6 unchanged, but 5's connect horizontally in row2 col10-12, and 4's connect in row6 col6-8; generated leaves 5's separate at col10 and col12, no 4 merge in row6, and 7's/9's unconnected. Fills overdid some 1's or missed seq order [from legend row11: 2,3,4,6,5,7,9?].
 * Ex3 generated: Detected blocks but minimal fills—e.g., no merges in upper sections (expected connects 3's horizontally in row3 cols3-8, 2's in row3 cols11-15, 9's in row3 cols19-21; generated leaves all separate), lower 4's/6's in row9 cols14-18 unmerged (expected 4's span), and 6's in rows13-17 col11 isolated (expected vertical stack). Also, row20 7's unfilled. Seems to pop wrong blocks from queues, skipping alignments.
 * Overall: Block finding/sorting/legend extraction works (no errors there), but connect_two_blocks fails on non-aligned bboxes (e.g., partial row overlap not handled—fills only full bbox height/width, missing partial gaps) and queue popping assumes strict first-to-first, but seq may require matching closest/aligned blocks, not positional first. No chaining effects (e.g., after connecting A-B, B's new bbox isn't updated for B-C).
 * connect_two_blocks is helpful but broken for partial alignments (e.g., if rows overlap partially, no fill; needs extension to max(min_r, other_min_r) etc.).
 * program overall copies grid correctly and uses queues, but loop only does len(seq)-1 connections without re-finding blocks post-fill, so no iterative merging.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant, but fill functions need enhancement for overlap.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills with 2's in many places (e.g., rows 1-5/8-13/15-21 have extensive 2 fills connecting across sections, like row3 col3-8/10-13/21-25, but this merges unrelated blocks and ignores sequence [likely from row26: 4,9,8,9,9,6,4,6,7,6,6,9,9,3,4,3,5,3,3,1,7,... non-1, but 8 is present? Wait, bg=1, legend non-1]. Expected should connect specific pairs like 2-to-4 in upper, but output fills entire rows with 2's, e.g., row16-20 all 2's in cols14-24, which looks like blob expansion rather than targeted gaps. Also, lower row22-25 has 2's filled into what should be isolated, and row27 legend unchanged but 1's overwritten? Misses vertical connections (e.g., 6's/7's in row10/27 unmerged) and creates uniform 2-regions that don't match puzzle's discrete shape extensions. This suggests wrong fill extents or ignoring alignments, making it incoherent for the sequence-based merging.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where numbered cells (2-9 represent colored blocks or regions, 1s are barriers or walls, and 8 is empty background) must be connected or extended into complete shapes based on a sequence extracted from a "key row" (likely the bottom or a specific row with clues). The goal is to fill gaps in background (8) areas between consecutive blocks in the sequence, respecting overlaps in rows/columns and barrier constraints, to form the expected filled regions without altering existing cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The key row is not always the bottom row; it must be identified as the row (starting from bottom) with 3-12 clue cells (2-9) where the number of runs of consecutive clues equals the clue count (i.e., no adjacent clues, suggesting isolated clues).
 * Sequence extraction skips non-clue cells (1s and 8s), creating an ordered list of 2-9 values that dictates connection order (e.g., connect block of seq[0] to seq[1], then seq[1] to seq[2], etc.).
 * Blocks are connected components of the same number (2-9), found via flood-fill (DFS/BFS with 4-directional adjacency); each block is represented by its bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
 * Gaps are filled only between consecutive blocks in the sequence if they "overlap" in the perpendicular dimension: for horizontal gaps (no column overlap, but row overlap), fill vertically separated areas; for vertical gaps (no row overlap, but column overlap), fill horizontally separated areas. Fill only background (8) cells, using the color of the first block (c1).
 * Barriers (1s) block filling and connectivity; blocks cannot cross 1s, and gaps cannot be filled over or through 1s.
 * Background is hardcoded as 8, but in test input, it appears to be 1 in some places (e.g., borders and separators), suggesting 1 might serve dual role as barrier and possible background in unfilled areas— this is a subtlety, as code assumes 8 is fillable bg.
 * Connections may require multiple passes or considering all pairs in sequence, but current code does one pass popping blocks left-to-right, which may mismatch if multiple blocks per color exist or if order is wrong.
 * Subtle: Overlap calculation uses max(0, end - start +1) for rows/columns; if no overlap in one dimension but gap in the other, fill the gap fully in the overlap range, but only if gap_start > gap_end is false (i.e., actual gap exists).
 * Easy to miss: Blocks are sorted by (min_r, min_c) per color, and deques popleft() assumes leftmost/topmost blocks are used first for connections, but this may not match puzzle intent if sequence implies specific pairings (e.g., nearest or spatially logical).
 * No filling if blocks already touch or overlap fully; also, no diagonal connections—only orthogonal.
 * In expectations, some regions extend beyond simple gaps (e.g., in ex1, 7 extends horizontally into what looks like barrier-adjacent areas, and vertically in other places; in ex2, 2 and 5 extend across barriers? Wait, no—looking closely, extensions respect 1s but fill 8s into shapes).
 * Puzzle may involve "stretching" or merging blocks only if they are the "next" in sequence, and unused blocks remain as-is.
 * All changes are non-destructive (deepcopy g, only fill if ==bg).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly identifies isolated-clue rows as keys and extracts sequences accurately (e.g., for ex1, seq likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5], skipping 8s).
 * What worked: Block detection via connected components is solid (preserves existing shapes like the 1-bordered regions); gap-filling logic correctly checks overlaps and only fills bg=8, avoiding overwrites; uses deques for ordered block consumption per color.
 * What didn't work: Fails to connect all required gaps—e.g., in ex1, 7 blocks not extended leftward into col11-13 or rightward fully (generated has isolated 7s in col14-15 row2-3 and col15-16 row2-3? Wait, output shows 7,7,1 in row2 col14-16, but expected has 7s in col11-13 and 15-17 row2-3, plus vertical extensions? Unknown why partial); similarly, 2 in row5-7 col2-3 not connected downward, 3 in row9-10 col1-5 not fully horizontal to col5-6, 4 in row14-15 col8-9 not extended right to col11-14, etc. Differences: Generated leaves many 8s unfilled where expected has color extensions (e.g., row2 col11-13=7, row5 col2-3=2 extended down; row9 col5-6=3; row13 col8-10=9? No, row13 has 9,9 in col8-9 expected but not in generated; generated row13 all 8s except later).
 * In ex2: Minimal filling (only existing blocks), but expected connects 2 horizontally in row2 col3 and col4-5? (generated has 2 only at row2 col2), 3 vertical? No, row4 col2=3 expected but not, 5 in row2 col10 and col12-13 connected; 4 in row6 col6-7 extended right? Differences: Generated ignores most connections, leaving isolated singles (e.g., no 2 at row2 col4, no 3 at row4 col6, no 4 extensions in row6 col8-9, no 5 at row2 col12-13); unknown if block popping order mismatches spatial needs.
 * In ex3: Some vertical stacking in lower blocks (e.g., 6 repeated in rows13-17 col11), but expected has horizontal extensions like 3 in row3 col6-8, 2 in row3 col11-13 and col17? No, and 4 in row9 col14-16, 9 vertical in row6 col19-20? Differences: Generated fills vertically downward for some (e.g., row18-22 all 1-frames with no fills), but misses horizontal merges (e.g., row3: generated has single 3 at col3, single 2 at col11, single 9 at col19; expected has 3x3 at col3-5? Wait row3 col3=3, but extended to col6-8=3; 2 at col11 extended to 13; 9 single but vertical later); also overfills? No, but leaves upper regions unfilled (e.g., row6 all 8s, expected has 9 at col19).
 * Block sorting and popleft() assumes sequential left/top pairing, but may need nearest-block matching or all-pairs checking.
 * find_key_row fallback to h-2 works if bottom is key, but in ex3 (27 cols? rows), it may pick wrong if multiple candidates.
 * No handling for multiple blocks per color in sequence (e.g., two 2s in seq for ex1); pops only one per pair, leaving others unused.
 * deepcopy and main program structure is good, but loop only for i in range(len(seq)-1), assuming one-to-one blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to partially fill some 2-regions (e.g., extending 2s horizontally/vertically within 1-frames in rows1-6,9-13,15-20,21-25? But places singletons like 4 at row3 col3, 8 at row3 col10 (8 is bg, shouldn't place?), 9 at row3 col22, 6 at row10 col3, etc., which seem like misplaced or unconnected clues rather than merged shapes.
 * Issues: Fills large 2 areas but ignores sequence order—bottom row27 seq likely [4,9,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7] (skipping 1s), so should connect 4 to 9 horizontally/vertically in gaps, but generated has scattered singles (e.g., 4 at row16 col14? But no merges; 8 placed erroneously?); upper regions like row15-20 have 2s filled in col14-18 and col20-24, but no color-specific extensions (all 2s, ignoring seq colors); borders are 1s, so bg=1? But code assumes 8, causing no fills where 1 is "bg" (e.g., inner areas unfilled properly). Does not match expected logic, as shapes should be color-specific merges (e.g., connect first 4 block to first 9, filling 1-gaps if possible, but respects 1-barriers); looks like over-reliance on 2-fills (perhaps misidentified key or seq), missing multi-color connections; unknown why singles like 8/9/4 appear without expansion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle consisting of a grid with multiple horizontal "blocks" (strips of 2+ rows containing non-background content, separated by all-background rows), where each block has a frame (typically color 1) enclosing inner contiguous regions of various colors (2+). A special "key row" near the bottom encodes a sequence of colors (non-background cells in that row), and the goal is to match inner regions across all blocks to this sequence by color, then connect consecutive matched regions horizontally (filling x-gaps in overlapping y-ranges) and vertically (filling y-gaps in overlapping x-ranges) using the color of the first region, effectively linking them while respecting frame/background constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks must be at least 2 rows tall and consist of non-all-background rows; empty or single-row strips are ignored.
 * Frame color detection is critical but fragile: it first checks for rows within the block that have exactly one unique non-background color (candidate for frame), taking the common one if unique; falls back to the most common non-background color overall. This fails subtly when inner regions span the full width/height of a block, creating rows with only inner colors (no visible frame), causing the inner color (e.g., 2) to be misdetected as frame—leading to no fills in background (1) gaps.
 * Inner regions ("inners") are contiguous horizontal runs of the same non-background, non-frame color within a block; vertically adjacent runs of the same color/x-range are merged into rectangular-ish blobs. Single-cell or non-contiguous same-color areas are treated separately if not merged.
 * Key row selection: Scan from bottom up for a row with 3-12 "runs" (sequences of non-background) and <=15 non-background cells total; default to second-last row if none found. Sequence is simply the list of non-background colors in left-to-right order (ignores background 1s).
 * Assignment of inners to sequence: Global across all blocks; for each sequence color, greedily pick the unused inner of that color with the minimal (y_start, x_start) position (top-left priority). This ignores block boundaries, spatial order, or sequence flow, potentially assigning "wrong" inners (e.g., a top-block inner to a late-sequence color, skipping lower ones) and causing cross-block or backward connections.
 * Horizontal connections: Only if x-ranges don't overlap and there's a gap; fill gap columns in the overlapping y-range (max y_start to min y_end) only where cells == empty_color (bg=1 if frame==1, else frame color). If no y-overlap (e.g., different blocks), no fill.
 * Vertical connections: Only if y-ranges don't overlap and there's a gap; fill entire gap rows in the overlapping x-range, but only if *all* cells in that sub-row (x-overlap) are empty_color—otherwise skip the row. This is stricter than horizontal (full-row-empty check), potentially missing partial fills.
 * Empty_color subtlety: Always bg (1) if frame is 1, but frame if frame !=1; combined with bad frame detection, this prevents filling true background (1) gaps when frame is mis-set to an inner color (e.g., only fills over misplaced "frame" cells, ignoring 1s).
 * Puzzle assumes colors 1+ (1=bg/frame), inners don't touch block edges directly in some cases, but code handles touching. Connections shouldn't overwrite existing non-empty cells (innners/frames). Global assignment may work for simple cases but fails when colors repeat across blocks without positional ordering.
 * Edge cases: Repeated colors in sequence/block (e.g., multiple 4s); single-column inners (e.g., 9s); key row with alternating bg/colored (e.g., 1,4,1,8,... → sequence [4,8,...]); vertical fills skipped if any cell in x-overlap isn't empty (e.g., stray frame pixel blocks whole row).
 * No rotation/reflection; grid is row-major List[List[int]]; deepcopy input to avoid mutation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/last submission provided; no prior attempts to compare.
 * Core extraction (blocks, inners) works well for identifying structures in training cases.
 * Frame detection is broken for blocks where inners create full single-color rows (mistakes inner for frame, e.g., 2 as frame in top block), preventing fills in bg=1 gaps—key failure in test.
 * Assignment greedy top-left works for unique colors or simple layouts (as in trainings) but fails subtly for repeated colors across blocks (assigns earliest positions first, leading to mismatched pairs like connecting top 4 to later lower 4, ignoring spatial sequence flow).
 * Key row detection and sequence extraction are solid and match expected (e.g., ignores 1s in alternating key).
 * Horizontal connects are mostly correct but skip non-empty_color gaps due to bad empty_color; vertical connects are overly strict (full sub-row empty check misses partial gaps, e.g., if a frame pixel blocks a row).
 * Trainings 1-3 passed fully, suggesting logic handles basic framed blocks with proper gaps (fills frame-color spaces correctly).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, but detect_frame_color needs fix (e.g., always assume frame=1 if bg=1, or check border colors only).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows minimal to no filling of gaps, leaving many 1-separated inner regions unconnected, which contradicts the expected puzzle goal of linking sequence-matched inners.
 * Specific observed effects: In top block (rows 1-5), row 3 has 4s (cols 3-5), then 1s (6-7), 4s (8-9), 8s (10-12), 1s (13-19), 8s (20-21), 9 (22), 2s (23-24)—no fills in 1-gaps (e.g., 6-7 stay 1, not filled with 4; 13-19 stay 1, not filled with 8 or 9), despite sequence starting 4-8-9 suggesting connections. Similarly, row 17 (lower block) has 9s (3-5), 1s (6-7), 9s (8-9), 4s (10-12), 1 (13), 4s (14-15), 5s (16-18), 1 (19), 5s (20-21), 3 (22), 2s (23-24)—gap at 13 stays 1, not filled (e.g., with 4), and 6-7/19 stay 1. Bottom block (rows 21-25) has partial 2s/3/7 but no evident gap fills (e.g., row 23: 2s,7,2s with possible 1s unfilled). Vertical connects appear absent (e.g., no filling between row 3's 9 and rows 4-5's 9 at col 22).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have filled 1-gaps with connecting colors (e.g., cols 6-9 in row 3 → 4s; cols 13-21 in row 3 → 8 or 9), creating solid color paths between matched inners per sequence [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7]. Instead, only existing inners remain, with 1s intact—likely due to frame misdetection (empty_color=2, skipping 1-gaps) and greedy assignment pairing distant/non-overlapping inners (no y/x overlap for fills). Some areas (e.g., row 17 col 14-15=4) may be input inners, not new fills. Overall, output looks like near-input grid with failed connections, not a solved puzzle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid with a background color (typically 1), framed blocks (often color 2) containing inner shapes of various colors (3-9), and a key row (usually near the bottom) providing a sequence of colors that dictates the order in which to connect matching inner shapes. The goal is to draw connections (fills) between consecutive shapes in the sequence using the color of the first shape in each pair, handling both horizontal and vertical gaps while preserving the original grid structure except for these connections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is detected as the top-left color; frames are uniform non-background colors surrounding inners within horizontal blocks of at least 2 rows.
 * Inners are extracted as contiguous vertical strips of the same non-background, non-frame color within blocks; they must be grouped by exact x-range and color to form complete shapes.
 * Key row is selected as the lowest row with 3-12 runs of non-background and <=15 non-background cells total; the sequence is the ordered non-background colors in that row (skipping backgrounds).
 * Assignment: Sort available inners by y_start then x_start; greedily assign the leftmost/topmost unused inner matching each sequence color in order (skips if no match, allowing multiples of same color to be used sequentially).
 * Connections: Only between consecutively assigned inners; use first inner's color to fill background gaps. Horizontal: Fill x-gaps in overlapping y-range if gap exists. Vertical: Fill y-gaps in overlapping x-range, but only in fully background ("empty") rows within the gap; if >2 empty rows, fill all; if <=2, fill only the last (bottommost) one—this seems like a heuristic that may miss full paths.
 * Subtleties: No self-connections or loops; connections don't overwrite existing non-background cells; vertical fills are conditional on empty rows to avoid overfilling, but this can leave gaps unfilled if rows aren't fully empty. Inners with height 1 are allowed. Duplicate colors in sequence require multiple matching inners, assigned in spatial order. Fallback key row is h-2 if no suitable row found. Preserve key row unchanged. Blocks ignore single-row non-background strips.
 * Easy to miss: Frame detection uses majority or uniform color per block, but falls back to most common non-bg; may misdetect if mixed. Connections only for assigned pairs, so unassigned inners remain isolated. Horizontal fills are straightforward, but vertical heuristic (partial fill for small gaps) may not create smooth paths in sparse areas.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; no prior versions summarized, but the code builds on standard grid processing.
 * Successfully detects blocks, frames, and inners correctly for training examples (all 3 passed), extracting shapes accurately.
 * Key row detection and sequence extraction work well for trainings, selecting appropriate row and order.
 * Assignment of inners to sequence via spatial sorting (top-left first) works for trainings, handling multiples correctly.
 * Horizontal connections fill gaps properly in overlapping y-ranges, preserving non-bg cells.
 * Vertical connections partially work but use a heuristic (fill all if >2 empty rows, else only last) that succeeds in trainings but may underfill in test.
 * No major misses in omission of single-row blocks or height-1 inners, as trainings passed.
 * Function `find_all_inners` is essential and correct for extracting objects; groups vertical contigs properly.
 * Function `detect_frame_color` is helpful but can fallback to majority, which is fine if uniform in trainings.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though vertical fill logic in main program may need generalization (e.g., always fill all empty rows in gap, not just heuristic).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially connects inners based on the key row sequence (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7), filling some horizontal gaps with matching colors (e.g., row 3 has 4's connecting 2-frame areas around an 8 inner, and a 9 appears isolated but assigned).
 * Vertical connections appear incomplete or selective: e.g., in the middle block (rows ~10-13), a 6 and 7 are present but no clear vertical fills between blocks; lower block (rows ~16-20) shows 9,4,5,3 inners but gaps remain unfilled (e.g., row 15 has isolated 6, not connected upward).
 * Expected: Full path connections forming a continuous line snaking through assigned inners (e.g., connect first 4 (top-left) to 8 below-right with 4-fills, then to 9, etc., filling all bg gaps in horizontal/vertical without the partial vertical rule; key row unchanged, all assigned inners linked in sequence order, unassigned inners untouched).
 * Observed differences: Some fills like extra 4's in row 3 and 9 in row 7/21 are present but seem misplaced (e.g., row 7 has lone 9 not tied to sequence path); vertical gaps (e.g., between row 6 and 8, or 13 and 15) are not filled, leaving disconnected components where a smooth path is expected; bottom block has partial horizontal fills (e.g., row 17 has 9,4,5,3 but no bridging 1's turned to prior color like 5 or 3). This does not fully match expected continuous connections—likely due to vertical heuristic underfilling small gaps and greedy assignment picking wrong inners for duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's/9's, but spatial order may skip intended path). The output makes partial sense (some links visible) but looks incorrect overall, as the path isn't complete/continuous.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
