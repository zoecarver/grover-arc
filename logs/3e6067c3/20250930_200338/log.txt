=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 20:03:38] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============

[2025-09-30 20:14:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1). The filling propagates colors from the chain into background areas, but only where components are adjacent in the chain and connect properly through the grid's outlined shapes, without overfilling or ignoring vertical extensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is consistently the dominant filler (e.g., 8 in training examples 1 and 2, 1 in example 3 and test), identified from the bottom-left of the last row; all empty spaces start as bg.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row (n-2), filtering non-bg cells to form a sequence of colors that serves as a key for filling; positions in the chain matter for adjacency (e.g., colors at positions differing by 1 are adjacent).
 * "Proto" is the outline color (e.g., 1), found in rows above the chain by identifying rows with exactly one non-bg color; this acts as a boundary or connector, and fillings should not overwrite proto but can bridge through gaps in proto-outlined regions.
 * Components in each row (i < n-2) are contiguous non-bg segments; for each row, identify sub-components (groups of same-color cells), excluding bg and proto, and assign a primary color (proto if no other, or the dominant non-proto/bg color).
 * Filling occurs only between adjacent components in the same row if their colors are adjacent in the chain (checked via position proximity in chain, e.g., any pair of positions abs(diff)==1); gaps are filled with the chain's color at the minimal position of the adjacent pair.
 * Subtlety: Filling is horizontal within rows but must account for vertical propagation or extension from the chain upwards, especially into all-bg areas directly above chain positions (e.g., creating vertical blobs like 2x3 in train1 rows 6-7); the current program only fills horizontally and skips proto-adjacent cases, missing these verticals.
 * Do not fill if either component involves proto (current skip condition is too broad: "if comps[k][2] == proto or comps[k + 1][2] == proto: continue"), which prevents necessary bridging.
 * Chain adjacency check uses all positions of a color (pos1 + pos2), finding min_p for fill color, but fails if colors appear multiple times non-adjacently; this works for simple cases but misses multi-occurrence logic.
 * Grids have varying widths (20 in train1/2, 27 in train3, 29 in test); ensure m = len(grid[0]) handles this.
 * Outlined shapes (e.g., 1's forming boundaries around inner colors like 2,3,4) suggest enclosed regions that should be filled consistently with chain colors, but only where connected vertically/horizontally without crossing outlines.
 * Last two rows are fixed (chain in n-2, bg in n-1); processing only affects rows 0 to n-3.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical stacking of fillings (e.g., expected train1 has 3-row vertical 2's and 6's in rows 6-8, but generated has none); program doesn't propagate upwards iteratively.
 * No diagonal connections; only orthogonal (horizontal in row, vertical implied by chain position).
 * Colors 2-9 are fillers; 1/8 often bg or proto, but bg varies per grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    return [grid[n-2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n-2][j] != bg]

# Helpful inline snippet: Find proto (outline color)
def find_proto(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> int:
    for row in grid[:-2]:
        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:
    non_bg_pos = [j for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] != bg]
    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

[2025-09-30 20:14:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)

        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:

    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

[2025-09-30 20:25:38] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a walled structure (using 1 as proto/walls) with background (likely 0) and colored regions (numbers like 2,3,4,...), where the goal is to fill empty background areas horizontally and vertically based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a key row near the bottom of the grid. The filling propagates colors between wall-separated regions only if the bordering colors are adjacent in the chain sequence, using the preceding or matching color from the chain to decide the fill color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is identified from the last row's first cell, assumed to be 0 or empty; all fills target only bg cells without overwriting existing colors or walls.
 * The chain is a sequence of non-bg colors extracted from the second-to-last row (grid[n-2]), representing an ordering of colors that defines valid adjacencies for filling (e.g., colors must appear consecutively in the chain to allow propagation between regions).
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into sections both vertically (stacks of wall rows) and horizontally (within rows); sections are contiguous blocks of rows with at least one proto in them.
 * Vertical filling occurs between non-adjacent vertical sections (with gap rows in between) by identifying "inner" rows in each section (first non-pure-proto/bg row), extracting uniform-color regions in those inners, and filling overlapping horizontal spans in the gap rows with a color from the chain if the bordering region colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling happens within individual rows, between consecutive walls, filling bg in uniform-color regions if bordering colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Subtlety: Regions must be uniform single-color (no mixed colors within a wall-bounded segment) to be considered for filling; scattered same-color cells in a segment don't qualify unless contiguous (code uses min/max j of js, but assumes uniformity).
 * Adjacency in chain is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color based on order (if a then b, return a; if b then a, return b), which might imply directionality in propagation (e.g., fill with the earlier-in-chain color).
 * Easy to miss: Vertical sections skip the last two rows (while i < n-2), assuming the chain and bg rows are at the bottom and not part of sections; inner rows are chosen as the first row in a section with non-proto/bg content.
 * Gaps between sections must have no overlap in filling logic; if sections are adjacent (end1 +1 >= start2), no vertical fill.
 * Chain extraction ignores bg and proto, but assumes the row has meaningful sequence; if chain <2 elements, no filling.
 * Overwriting only bg; existing colors (like special numbers 3-9) stay, so fills don't propagate over pre-placed colors.
 * Grid dimensions: Assumes rectangular (n rows, m cols); early returns if n<3.
 * Potential edge case: Multiple regions per inner row; filling only where horizontal overlaps exist between upper/lower regions.
 * Chain may include duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's), allowing multiple adjacencies; is_adjacent_preceding checks for exact pairs in sequence, not just presence.

            return b
    return None  # Checks chain adjacency and returns the "source" color; core logic for valid fills.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it successfully handled all three training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating solid core logic for basic vertical and horizontal filling between wall sections using chain adjacencies.
 * Worked well for identifying bg (0), extracting chain from second-last row, and finding vertical sections excluding bottom two rows.
 * Vertical fill correctly skips adjacent sections and only fills gaps where inner-row regions overlap horizontally and colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Horizontal fill properly identifies regions between walls in rows and fills if adjacent in chain, but only within the same row.
 * What didn't work/may be limited: get_inner_row picks only the first valid row in a section, potentially missing multi-row sections with varying inner content; if a section has no qualifying inner row (all proto/bg), skips entirely.
 * get_regions requires strictly uniform single color per inter-wall segment (set len==1), which works if regions are solid but may fail if input has pre-filled partials or mixed bg/colors; it also takes min/max of js but doesn't ensure full coverage (e.g., holes in region ignored).
 * is_adjacent_preceding is symmetric but biased toward the order in chain (returns the first in pair), which succeeded in training but might not handle reverse propagation or multi-hop chains.
 * No extraction of "objects" per se (e.g., full blobs or connected components); focuses on wall-bounded regions, which is helpful but assumes walls define all boundaries—may miss open areas without walls.
 * horizontal_fill re-extracts regions per row (redundant with get_regions) and uses index k of walls for positioning, which is functional but inefficient; it fills only between consecutive regions in the same row.
 * vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are applied sequentially (vert then horiz), which may overwrite or miss interactions if horiz creates new adjacencies for vert (but since copies grid, it's one-pass).
 * No handling for chain colors not present in regions (fills only if exact match); assumes proto=1 fixed, bg dynamic.
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of wall-section-chain rules but may underfill in complex test cases with multi-layer sections or non-uniform inners.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from lists) with heavy use of 1's as walls/borders, large areas filled with 2's (likely the dominant chain color), and isolated special colors (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) placed in specific positions across rows 3,10,17,23, matching a pattern like staggered "key" placements vertically aligned with the bottom chain row 27: [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,...].
 * It looks partially correct: Upper sections (rows 0-6,8-13) are mostly 2-filled between walls with specials like 4,8,9,6,7,4 in row 3/10, suggesting vertical propagation of 2's where adjacent to chain (assuming 2 is prevalent in chain), and specials are preserved (not overwritten).
 * Middle section (rows 15-19) has expanded 2's in central columns (14-19) with specials 9,4,5,3, indicating horizontal/vertical fills triggered by chain adjacencies (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 9/4/5/3, fill 2 in overlaps).
 * Lower sections (rows 21-25) have narrower 2-fills (columns 20-24) with 7 in row 23, showing localized filling, possibly due to narrower wall sections or no overlap with upper regions.
 * What doesn't look correct: Many areas remain as 1's or potentially unfilled (though output shows no explicit 0's, assuming bg was 0 and filled to 2's where possible); for example, rows 1-2,4-5, etc., mirror row structures but fill only 2's around specials without propagating the specials themselves upward/downward—e.g., the 4 in row 3 col 3 isn't filled vertically into row 2 col 3 (still 2?), suggesting vertical_fill didn't trigger for that pair (perhaps no chain adjacency between 4 and bordering 2, or no gap/overlap). Similarly, central expansions in rows 15-19 seem correct, but lower partial fills (only cols 20-24) differ from upper full-width 2's, possibly missing vertical propagation across full horizontal span if chain doesn't support wider overlaps. Bottom rows 26-28 are all 1's except the chain in 27, which is preserved correctly. Overall, it makes sense for a chain-heavy-2 puzzle but appears incomplete in propagating specials (e.g., no 4/8/9 fills beyond their input positions), which might be expected if the puzzle requires filling gaps with adjacent chain colors including specials; unknown if input had these specials pre-placed or if filling should expand them—differs from expectation of fuller special propagation if chain allows (e.g., if 4 adjacent to 2, why not fill more 4's?).

[2025-09-30 20:25:38] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1). The filling propagates colors from the chain into background areas, but only where components are adjacent in the chain and connect properly through the grid's outlined shapes, without overfilling or ignoring vertical extensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is consistently the dominant filler (e.g., 8 in training examples 1 and 2, 1 in example 3 and test), identified from the bottom-left of the last row; all empty spaces start as bg.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row (n-2), filtering non-bg cells to form a sequence of colors that serves as a key for filling; positions in the chain matter for adjacency (e.g., colors at positions differing by 1 are adjacent).
 * "Proto" is the outline color (e.g., 1), found in rows above the chain by identifying rows with exactly one non-bg color; this acts as a boundary or connector, and fillings should not overwrite proto but can bridge through gaps in proto-outlined regions.
 * Components in each row (i < n-2) are contiguous non-bg segments; for each row, identify sub-components (groups of same-color cells), excluding bg and proto, and assign a primary color (proto if no other, or the dominant non-proto/bg color).
 * Filling occurs only between adjacent components in the same row if their colors are adjacent in the chain (checked via position proximity in chain, e.g., any pair of positions abs(diff)==1); gaps are filled with the chain's color at the minimal position of the adjacent pair.
 * Subtlety: Filling is horizontal within rows but must account for vertical propagation or extension from the chain upwards, especially into all-bg areas directly above chain positions (e.g., creating vertical blobs like 2x3 in train1 rows 6-7); the current program only fills horizontally and skips proto-adjacent cases, missing these verticals.
 * Do not fill if either component involves proto (current skip condition is too broad: "if comps[k][2] == proto or comps[k + 1][2] == proto: continue"), which prevents necessary bridging.
 * Chain adjacency check uses all positions of a color (pos1 + pos2), finding min_p for fill color, but fails if colors appear multiple times non-adjacently; this works for simple cases but misses multi-occurrence logic.
 * Grids have varying widths (20 in train1/2, 27 in train3, 29 in test); ensure m = len(grid[0]) handles this.
 * Outlined shapes (e.g., 1's forming boundaries around inner colors like 2,3,4) suggest enclosed regions that should be filled consistently with chain colors, but only where connected vertically/horizontally without crossing outlines.
 * Last two rows are fixed (chain in n-2, bg in n-1); processing only affects rows 0 to n-3.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical stacking of fillings (e.g., expected train1 has 3-row vertical 2's and 6's in rows 6-8, but generated has none); program doesn't propagate upwards iteratively.
 * No diagonal connections; only orthogonal (horizontal in row, vertical implied by chain position).
 * Colors 2-9 are fillers; 1/8 often bg or proto, but bg varies per grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    return [grid[n-2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n-2][j] != bg]

# Helpful inline snippet: Find proto (outline color)
def find_proto(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> int:
    for row in grid[:-2]:
        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:
    non_bg_pos = [j for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] != bg]
    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a walled structure (using 1 as proto/walls) with background (likely 0) and colored regions (numbers like 2,3,4,...), where the goal is to fill empty background areas horizontally and vertically based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a key row near the bottom of the grid.

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> int:
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b:
            return a
        if chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a:
            return b
    return None  # Checks chain adjacency and returns the "source" color; core logic for valid fills.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it successfully handled all three training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating solid core logic for basic vertical and horizontal filling between wall sections using chain adjacencies.
 * Worked well for identifying bg (0), extracting chain from second-last row, and finding vertical sections excluding bottom two rows.
 * Vertical fill correctly skips adjacent sections and only fills gaps where inner-row regions overlap horizontally and colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Horizontal fill properly identifies regions between walls in rows and fills if adjacent in chain, but only within the same row.
 * What didn't work/may be limited: get_inner_row picks only the first valid row in a section, potentially missing multi-row sections with varying inner content; if a section has no qualifying inner row (all proto/bg), skips entirely.
 * get_regions requires strictly uniform single color per inter-wall segment (set len==1), which works if regions are solid but may fail if input has pre-filled partials or mixed bg/colors; it also takes min/max of js but doesn't ensure full coverage (e.g., holes in region ignored).
 * is_adjacent_preceding is symmetric but biased toward the order in chain (returns the first in pair), which succeeded in training but might not handle reverse propagation or multi-hop chains.
 * No extraction of "objects" per se (e.g., full blobs or connected components); focuses on wall-bounded regions, which is helpful but assumes walls define all boundaries—may miss open areas without walls.
 * horizontal_fill re-extracts regions per row (redundant with get_regions) and uses index k of walls for positioning, which is functional but inefficient; it fills only between consecutive regions in the same row.
 * vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are applied sequentially (vert then horiz), which may overwrite or miss interactions if horiz creates new adjacencies for vert (but since copies grid, it's one-pass).
 * No handling for chain colors not present in regions (fills only if exact match); assumes proto=1 fixed, bg dynamic.
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of wall-section-chain rules but may underfill in complex test cases with multi-layer sections or non-uniform inners.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from lists) with heavy use of 1's as walls/borders, large areas filled with 2's (likely the dominant chain color), and isolated special colors (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) placed in specific positions across rows 3,10,17,23, matching a pattern like staggered "key" placements vertically aligned with the bottom chain row 27: [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,...].
 * It looks partially correct: Upper sections (rows 0-6,8-13) are mostly 2-filled between walls with specials like 4,8,9,6,7,4 in row 3/10, suggesting vertical propagation of 2's where adjacent to chain (assuming 2 is prevalent in chain), and specials are preserved (not overwritten).
 * Middle section (rows 15-19) has expanded 2's in central columns (14-19) with specials 9,4,5,3, indicating horizontal/vertical fills triggered by chain adjacencies (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 9/4/5/3, fill 2 in overlaps).
 * Lower sections (rows 21-25) have narrower 2-fills (columns 20-24) with 7 in row 23, showing localized filling, possibly due to narrower wall sections or no overlap with upper regions.
 * What doesn't look correct: Many areas remain as 1's or potentially unfilled (though output shows no explicit 0's, assuming bg was 0 and filled to 2's where possible); for example, rows 1-2,4-5, etc., mirror row structures but fill only 2's around specials without propagating the specials themselves upward/downward—e.g., the 4 in row 3 col 3 isn't filled vertically into row 2 col 3 (still 2?), suggesting vertical_fill didn't trigger for that pair (perhaps no chain adjacency between 4 and bordering 2, or no gap/overlap). Similarly, central expansions in rows 15-19 seem correct, but lower partial fills (only cols 20-24) differ from upper full-width 2's, possibly missing vertical propagation across full horizontal span if chain doesn't support wider overlaps. Bottom rows 26-28 are all 1's except the chain in 27, which is preserved correctly. Overall, it makes sense for a chain-heavy-2 puzzle but appears incomplete in propagating specials (e.g., no 4/8/9 fills beyond their input positions), which might be expected if the puzzle requires filling gaps with adjacent chain colors including specials; unknown if input had these specials pre-placed or if filling should expand them—differs from expectation of fuller special propagation if chain allows (e.g., if 4 adjacent to 2, why not fill more 4's?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 20:36:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where numbers represent colors or barriers: 1 acts as walls/barriers (proto), 8 is typically background (bg), other numbers (2-9) are specific colors to propagate and fill into bg areas. The goal is to fill bg cells with appropriate colors based on connected uniform regions, vertical/horizontal propagation within wall-bounded sections, and gap-filling between sections using adjacency rules derived from a "chain" (likely a key sequence) extracted from near the bottom of the grid, ensuring shapes and separations match implied puzzle logic like nonograms or region-filling with constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into segments/regions both horizontally (within rows) and vertically (across rows); sections are defined as consecutive rows that contain some 1's but are not entirely 1's, and propagation must respect these boundaries without crossing full-1 rows or unrelated areas.
 * Background (bg, usually 8) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows; it must be filled only where a uniform color can be inferred from adjacent non-bg/non-proto cells, but never overwrite existing colors or 1's.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row, capturing non-bg/non-proto cells as a sequence of colors (e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in train1); this acts as an adjacency key—fills between regions use a color from the chain only if two adjacent regions' colors (a and b) appear next to each other in the chain, preferring the "preceding" one in the pair.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, segments between 1's (or edges) should be filled with a single color if all non-bg/non-proto cells in that segment share one color; bg cells in the segment get that color, but gaps between filled segments (still bg) get filled via chain if the bounding segments' colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a detected section (consecutive partial-1 rows), fill vertically column-by-column: if a vertical segment between 1's has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, propagate that color to all bg cells in that vertical run; do not cross 1's or section boundaries.
 * Gap filling between sections: For gaps (all-8 or partial rows) between two sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section), get their horizontal filled regions, and for overlapping column ranges between upper/lower regions with colors a/b, if a and b are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rectangle (overlapping columns, all gap rows) with the preceding color from the chain pair; only fill bg or 1's in those positions (but 1's might be subtle—avoid overwriting true walls?).
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency is bidirectional but returns the "preceding" color in the pair (e.g., if chain has ...a,b..., fill with a; if ...b,a..., fill with b); sections must exclude the last two rows (header/footer?); inner row selection picks the first row in a section with any non-1/bg, but if none, skip; do not fill if segment colors aren't uniform (len(seg_colors)==1); gaps only if gap_start <= gap_end; vertical propagation skips 1's but fills around them if uniform; chain extraction ignores bg and 1's but preserves order; in multi-row uniform blocks, ensure consistency across rows; bottom row (and possibly second-bottom) is the key and should remain unchanged; full-8 rows separate sections but aren't sections themselves; overlapping regions in gap-fill use max/min columns for projection.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal fill must happen before vertical/section detection (as in code), but gap-fill after; chain might have duplicates (e.g., two 2's in train1), so adjacency checks all pairs; if no uniform color, leave as bg; vertical fill only within section bounds, not across gaps; in train3, large sections need multi-row consistency; test grid has wider layout with more colors (3-9), so chain likely longer; do not fill the very top/bottom rows unless they fit section rules; bg detection scans only upper rows (n-2) to avoid key contamination.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding but incomplete implementation of propagation and gap-filling rules.
 * Horizontal filling worked partially: In train1, upper sections (rows 1-4) correctly filled uniform 1/2/5/7 segments between 1's, but failed to fill intra-row gaps between segments (e.g., row1 generated 1's but left 7/8 areas as 8's instead of using chain); similar in train2 (filled some 1/2/3/5/7 but left row1's 2-block incomplete) and train3 (filled multi-row 1/3/2/9 blocks but missed vertical consistency in lower sections).
 * Vertical propagation worked somewhat: In train1, it extended colors within sections (e.g., 2's and 5's in rows 2-3), but skipped or failed in wider blocks; in train2, filled rows5-7 correctly for 1/4/6/9 but not row4 gaps; in train3, extended upper 1/3/2 blocks across rows1-5 but left lower sections (rows8-11) with incomplete 4/6 fills (e.g., row9 has 6 but not propagated fully).
 * Section detection worked basically: Correctly identified partial-1 row groups (e.g., train1 sections at rows0-4 and 8-11; train2 at 0-2 and 5-7; train3 at 0-5 and 8-11 and 17-21), excluding full-8 and last two rows, but <n-2 limit missed some lower sections in train3 (e.g., rows17-21 detected but propagation incomplete).
 * Gap filling failed entirely: No fills in inter-section gaps; e.g., train1 generated all-8 rows5-7 where expected has 2/6 blocks (projected from upper/lower), and row12 all-8 vs expected 9/2; train2 row4 all-8 vs expected 3/6/7 blocks; train3 row6-7 and row12-16 all-8 vs expected 9/6 blocks—likely because get_inner returned valid rows but overlap checks (o_l > o_r) or chain adjacency failed (e.g., wrong preceding color or no match); also, perform_gap_fills skipped if no inner or gap too small.
 * Chain extraction worked: For train1, likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] matching bottom; used in horizontal but not effectively in gaps (e.g., 2 and 6 should fill with preceding if adjacent in chain, but didn't).
 * Bg detection worked: 8 correctly identified in all.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: perform_gap_fills is broken (no fills occur, possibly due to strict overlap or fill_c None; overwrites proto=1 in gaps? but shouldn't); get_filled_regions misses non-uniform post-fill; vertical_propagate_within skips too aggressively (leaves bg in multi-color verticals, but examples need uniform check); overall program modifies grid_out in-place but doesn't handle multi-section gaps or chain duplicates well; no function for full-grid uniformity check post-fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete propagation and missing gap fills similar to training failures; e.g., rows1-6 have 4's and 8's filled horizontally but no vertical extension to row6's partial 9's, and row7-8 all 1's (possibly misbg?) where gaps should project colors like 9's from above; rows8-12 fill 6/7/4 but row13 cuts 4's short (ends with 1's instead of full block), suggesting horizontal_fill failed end-segment; row15 has 9/5/3 blocks but row16 all 1's (gap unfilled, should project from row15 to row20's 3/7?); rows21-25 fill 3 then 7's but inconsistently (row21 3's full, rows22-26 7's but row26 all 1's?); bottom key row27 has 4/8/9/etc. unchanged (good), but overall lacks vertical consistency in lower half (e.g., 5/3/7 blocks not propagated up from key projections) and gap rectangles (e.g., between row12 and row14, no 4/5/3 fills); compared to training patterns, it over-relies on horizontal (matches upper 4/8/9 shapes) but misses chain-based gap/vertical for lower (e.g., expected likely has 7's extending up from row22 into row16 gap, using chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 5-7); without expected, it differs by leaving too many 1's/bg in gaps/verticals, making shapes incomplete (e.g., 4-block in row13-14 not uniform height).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 20:36:19] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Large enclosing shapes**: Blue-bordered squares or polyomino-like structures (e.g., single squares, L-shapes, or connected forms) in the main grid area, varying in size and configuration across input (discrete 3x3-ish layout) and output (interconnected paths).
- **Inner colored elements**: Smaller solid-colored squares (yellow, red, dark red/brown, blue, cyan, magenta/purple, green, orange) placed inside or forming the enclosing shapes, positioned at corners, centers, or edges, with colors repeating or transforming between input (nested within blues) and output (integrated into connections).
- **Connecting elements**: Horizontal or vertical bars/lines in colors like purple, yellow, or red, linking shapes in the output but absent or minimal in the input.
- **Color key row**: Linear sequence of 8-10 small standalone colored squares at the bottom (e.g., yellow, brown/dark blue, cyan, purple, cyan/light blue, yellow, orange, green, purple/magenta), serving as a legend or palette, consistent in purpose but varying slightly in order and shades between input and output.
- **Background and borders**: Overall blue or maroon background with implicit grid lines, using bold colored blocks to denote filled areas versus empty space.

[2025-09-30 20:38:35] Response:
### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and their properties extracted from the provided data, focusing **only** on those with clear, consistent interactions or effects across **all** train examples (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). I ignored test inputs since they lack outputs for verification of transformations. Interactions are limited to those that are obvious, repeatable, and present in **every** train pair (no assumptions about puzzle-solving logic, no high-level interpretations like "paths" or "matching rules"). 

Only elements with spatial, color, or structural connections that hold true in all cases are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated background properties without ties to others, one-off shade variations like "dark red" vs. "brown", or elements without cross-example effects) are excluded. Where a connection's mechanism is not explainable from the data (e.g., why a specific color is chosen), it is noted as unknown rather than speculated.

#### Core Components
1. **Enclosing Frames**  
   - Properties: Large structures with color (consistently Blue in all train inputs/outputs), holes=1, variable bounding box (bbox) sizes (e.g., [1,1,4,4] or [1,1,5,5]), pixels indicating border-like area (e.g., 8-24, never solid-filled). Arranged in discrete rows (2-4 frames per row, separated by 1-4 unit gaps in x or y).  
   - No changes: Position, size, holes, pixels, and color remain identical from input to output in every train example.

2. **Inner Tokens**  
   - Properties: Small solid-colored squares (holes=0) placed centrally or offset within enclosing frames. Colors vary (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Orange, Pink, Light Blue, Dark Red). Sizes: 1x1 (pixels=1) or 2x2 (pixels=4), with bbox fully nested inside frame bbox. One per frame consistently.  
   - No changes: Position, size, holes, pixels, and color remain identical from input to output in every train example. Never appear outside frames.

3. **Background**  
   - Properties: Large overarching structure (color Maroon in all train examples), high holes (12-16 in input, 7-9 in output), full-canvas bbox (e.g., [0,0,19,19]), high pixels (181-573) representing empty/fillable space. Implicit grid-like layout inferred from bbox alignments.  
   - Changes consistently tied to other components (see interactions below).

4. **Color Key Row**  
   - Properties: Linear bottom row of 6-8 standalone 1x1 solid squares (holes=0, pixels=1 each), colors matching inner token palette (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Pink, Orange, Dark Red, Light Blue). Fixed y-position (e.g., y=11,18,25), spaced evenly in x (gaps of 2 units). Serves as static reference (order varies slightly but purpose consistent).  
   - No changes: Identical in every input/output pair; no interactions with other components beyond color palette overlap.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are the only connections that occur in **every** train input-to-output transformation. They involve direct effects like spatial adjacency, property inheritance, or quantitative changes. No forced or inconsistent links (e.g., no reliable "left vs. right" color inheritance, as it fails in train1 top row and train3 middle row).

1. **Spatial Containment: Enclosing Frames → Inner Tokens**  
   - Effect: Inner token bbox is always fully nested inside its enclosing frame's bbox (e.g., frame [1,1,4,4] contains token [2,2,3,3]). Offset is consistent (e.g., centered or edge-aligned).  
   - Consistency: Holds in all frames across all inputs/outputs. No tokens escape frames; this containment persists unchanged.  
   - Interconnected properties: Frame bbox dimensions directly limit token position; token holes=0 contrasts with frame holes=1, emphasizing nesting.

2. **Adjacency-Based Placement: Enclosing Frames → New Connecting Bars (Output-Only)**  
   - Effect: New solid rectangles (holes=0, pixels=1-6, bar-like bboxes e.g., 1-3 units wide/tall) appear exclusively in gaps between adjacent enclosing frames (horizontal gaps in same row, e.g., x=4 between frames at x=1-3 and x=5-7; vertical gaps between rows, e.g., y=4 or y=12). Not all gaps fill (inconsistent which ones), but when added, they bridge exact gap positions without overlapping frames or tokens.  
   - Consistency: Present in every output (0-7 new bars per example); absent in all inputs. Bars never appear in non-gap areas or isolated.  
   - Interconnected properties: Frame bbox gaps (position differences, e.g., Δx=1-4 or Δy=1-3) directly determine bar bbox placement and size (bars scale to fit gap, e.g., width matches Δx). No bars in examples without frame rows/gaps.

3. **Color Inheritance (Partial): Inner Tokens / Color Key → New Connecting Bars**  
   - Effect: New bars always use a color from the inner tokens or color key palette (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow; no new colors introduced). Specific choice matches an adjacent inner token's color in some cases (e.g., bar next to Green token is Green), but not reliably (fails in ~30% of bars, e.g., train1 vertical Pink bar between Dark Red and Pink tokens).  
   - Consistency: Every bar color is palette-restricted; unknown mechanism for exact selection (cannot explain mismatches without solving).  
   - Interconnected properties: Token colors (or key colors) limit bar color options; bar pixels/size unaffected by color.

4. **Quantitative Impact: New Connecting Bars → Background**  
   - Effect: Background pixels decrease exactly by the total pixels of all new bars (e.g., train1: -32 pixels matching sum of 7 bars' pixels=32; train2: -6; train3: -15). Background holes decrease by 5-7 (proportional to bars added, but exact Δholes unknown). No other changes to background.  
   - Consistency: Exact pixel match in every train pair; holes always decrease but not by a fixed rule.  
   - Interconnected properties: Bar pixels directly subtract from background pixels (additive fill effect); bar count indirectly affects holes (each bar reduces holes by ~1, but inconsistent). Background bbox unchanged.

#### Notes on Limits and Unknowns
- **No other consistent interactions**: E.g., no reliable vertical vs. horizontal bar differences; no frame color effects (all Blue in train); no token movement/duplication (all static); no key row changes or ties beyond color pool. Test inputs show varying frame colors (Red/Maroon), but without outputs, no verified interactions.
- **Unknowns called out**: Exact selection of which gaps get bars (e.g., why train2 adds at x=4 but not x=8 in top row) is unknown—position adjacency is necessary but not sufficient. Bar color rule is partially inherited but unpredictable (e.g., not always left/upper token). Hole decreases in background are consistent in direction but not formulaic.
- **Irrelevant exclusions**: Standalone elements (e.g., maroon inner in test1, but not in train); inconsistent shades (e.g., "dark red" vs. "red" not always interactive); total pixel counts without ties (e.g., frame pixels stable but not affecting others). No high-level "solution" inferred.

[2025-09-30 20:38:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1). The filling propagates colors from the chain into background areas, but only where components are adjacent in the chain and connect properly through the grid's outlined shapes, without overfilling or ignoring vertical extensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is consistently the dominant filler (e.g., 8 in training examples 1 and 2, 1 in example 3 and test), identified from the bottom-left of the last row; all empty spaces start as bg.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row (n-2), filtering non-bg cells to form a sequence of colors that serves as a key for filling; positions in the chain matter for adjacency (e.g., colors at positions differing by 1 are adjacent).
 * "Proto" is the outline color (e.g., 1), found in rows above the chain by identifying rows with exactly one non-bg color; this acts as a boundary or connector, and fillings should not overwrite proto but can bridge through gaps in proto-outlined regions.
 * Components in each row (i < n-2) are contiguous non-bg segments; for each row, identify sub-components (groups of same-color cells), excluding bg and proto, and assign a primary color (proto if no other, or the dominant non-proto/bg color).
 * Filling occurs only between adjacent components in the same row if their colors are adjacent in the chain (checked via position proximity in chain, e.g., any pair of positions abs(diff)==1); gaps are filled with the chain's color at the minimal position of the adjacent pair.
 * Subtlety: Filling is horizontal within rows but must account for vertical propagation or extension from the chain upwards, especially into all-bg areas directly above chain positions (e.g., creating vertical blobs like 2x3 in train1 rows 6-7); the current program only fills horizontally and skips proto-adjacent cases, missing these verticals.
 * Do not fill if either component involves proto (current skip condition is too broad: "if comps[k][2] == proto or comps[k + 1][2] == proto: continue"), which prevents necessary bridging.
 * Chain adjacency check uses all positions of a color (pos1 + pos2), finding min_p for fill color, but fails if colors appear multiple times non-adjacently; this works for simple cases but misses multi-occurrence logic.
 * Grids have varying widths (20 in train1/2, 27 in train3, 29 in test); ensure m = len(grid[0]) handles this.
 * Outlined shapes (e.g., 1's forming boundaries around inner colors like 2,3,4) suggest enclosed regions that should be filled consistently with chain colors, but only where connected vertically/horizontally without crossing outlines.
 * Last two rows are fixed (chain in n-2, bg in n-1); processing only affects rows 0 to n-3.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical stacking of fillings (e.g., expected train1 has 3-row vertical 2's and 6's in rows 6-8, but generated has none); program doesn't propagate upwards iteratively.
 * No diagonal connections; only orthogonal (horizontal in row, vertical implied by chain position).
 * Colors 2-9 are fillers; 1/8 often bg or proto, but bg varies per grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    return [grid[n-2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n-2][j] != bg]

# Helpful inline snippet: Find proto (outline color)
def find_proto(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> int:
    for row in grid[:-2]:
        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:
    non_bg_pos = [j for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] != bg]
    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where numbers represent colors or barriers: 1 acts as walls/barriers (proto), 8 is typically background (bg), other numbers (2-9) are specific colors to propagate and fill into bg areas. The goal is to fill bg cells with appropriate colors based on connected uniform regions, vertical/horizontal propagation within wall-bounded sections, and gap-filling between sections using adjacency rules derived from a "chain" (likely a key sequence) extracted from near the bottom of the grid, ensuring shapes and separations match implied puzzle logic like nonograms or region-filling with constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into segments/regions both horizontally (within rows) and vertically (across rows); sections are defined as consecutive rows that contain some 1's but are not entirely 1's, and propagation must respect these boundaries without crossing full-1 rows or unrelated areas.
 * Background (bg, usually 8) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows; it must be filled only where a uniform color can be inferred from adjacent non-bg/non-proto cells, but never overwrite existing colors or 1's.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row, capturing non-bg/non-proto cells as a sequence of colors (e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in train1); this acts as an adjacency key—fills between regions use a color from the chain only if two adjacent regions' colors (a and b) appear next to each other in the chain, preferring the "preceding" one in the pair.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, segments between 1's (or edges) should be filled with a single color if all non-bg/non-proto cells in that segment share one color; bg cells in the segment get that color, but gaps between filled segments (still bg) get filled via chain if the bounding segments' colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a detected section (consecutive partial-1 rows), fill vertically column-by-column: if a vertical segment between 1's has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, propagate that color to all bg cells in that vertical run; do not cross 1's or section boundaries.
 * Gap filling between sections: For gaps (all-8 or partial rows) between two sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section), get their horizontal filled regions, and for overlapping column ranges between upper/lower regions with colors a/b, if a and b are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rectangle (overlapping columns, all gap rows) with the preceding color from the chain pair; only fill bg or 1's in those positions (but 1's might be subtle—avoid overwriting true walls?).
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency is bidirectional but returns the "preceding" color in the pair (e.g., if chain has ...a,b..., fill with a; if ...b,a..., fill with b); sections must exclude the last two rows (header/footer?); inner row selection picks the first row in a section with any non-1/bg, but if none, skip; do not fill if segment colors aren't uniform (len(seg_colors)==1); gaps only if gap_start <= gap_end; vertical propagation skips 1's but fills around them if uniform; chain extraction ignores bg and 1's but preserves order; in multi-row uniform blocks, ensure consistency across rows; bottom row (and possibly second-bottom) is the key and should remain unchanged; full-8 rows separate sections but aren't sections themselves; overlapping regions in gap-fill use max/min columns for projection.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal fill must happen before vertical/section detection (as in code), but gap-fill after; chain might have duplicates (e.g., two 2's in train1), so adjacency checks all pairs; if no uniform color, leave as bg; vertical fill only within section bounds, not across gaps; in train3, large sections need multi-row consistency; test grid has wider layout with more colors (3-9), so chain likely longer; do not fill the very top/bottom rows unless they fit section rules; bg detection scans only upper rows (n-2) to avoid key contamination.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding but incomplete implementation of propagation and gap-filling rules.
 * Horizontal filling worked partially: In train1, upper sections (rows 1-4) correctly filled uniform 1/2/5/7 segments between 1's, but failed to fill intra-row gaps between segments (e.g., row1 generated 1's but left 7/8 areas as 8's instead of using chain); similar in train2 (filled some 1/2/3/5/7 but left row1's 2-block incomplete) and train3 (filled multi-row 1/3/2/9 blocks but missed vertical consistency in lower sections).
 * Vertical propagation worked somewhat: In train1, it extended colors within sections (e.g., 2's and 5's in rows 2-3), but skipped or failed in wider blocks; in train2, filled rows5-7 correctly for 1/4/6/9 but not row4 gaps; in train3, extended upper 1/3/2 blocks across rows1-5 but left lower sections (rows8-11) with incomplete 4/6 fills (e.g., row9 has 6 but not propagated fully).
 * Section detection worked basically: Correctly identified partial-1 row groups (e.g., train1 sections at rows0-4 and 8-11; train2 at 0-2 and 5-7; train3 at 0-5 and 8-11 and 17-21), excluding full-8 and last two rows, but <n-2 limit missed some lower sections in train3 (e.g., rows17-21 detected but propagation incomplete).
 * Gap filling failed entirely: No fills in inter-section gaps; e.g., train1 generated all-8 rows5-7 where expected has 2/6 blocks (projected from upper/lower), and row12 all-8 vs expected 9/2; train2 row4 all-8 vs expected 3/6/7 blocks; train3 row6-7 and row12-16 all-8 vs expected 9/6 blocks—likely because get_inner returned valid rows but overlap checks (o_l > o_r) or chain adjacency failed (e.g., wrong preceding color or no match); also, perform_gap_fills skipped if no inner or gap too small.
 * Chain extraction worked: For train1, likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] matching bottom; used in horizontal but not effectively in gaps (e.g., 2 and 6 should fill with preceding if adjacent in chain, but didn't).
 * Bg detection worked: 8 correctly identified in all.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: perform_gap_fills is broken (no fills occur, possibly due to strict overlap or fill_c None; overwrites proto=1 in gaps? but shouldn't); get_filled_regions misses non-uniform post-fill; vertical_propagate_within skips too aggressively (leaves bg in multi-color verticals, but examples need uniform check); overall program modifies grid_out in-place but doesn't handle multi-section gaps or chain duplicates well; no function for full-grid uniformity check post-fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete propagation and missing gap fills similar to training failures; e.g., rows1-6 have 4's and 8's filled horizontally but no vertical extension to row6's partial 9's, and row7-8 all 1's (possibly misbg?) where gaps should project colors like 9's from above; rows8-12 fill 6/7/4 but row13 cuts 4's short (ends with 1's instead of full block), suggesting horizontal_fill failed end-segment; row15 has 9/5/3 blocks but row16 all 1's (gap unfilled, should project from row15 to row20's 3/7?); rows21-25 fill 3 then 7's but inconsistently (row21 3's full, rows22-26 7's but row26 all 1's?); bottom key row27 has 4/8/9/etc. unchanged (good), but overall lacks vertical consistency in lower half (e.g., 5/3/7 blocks not propagated up from key projections) and gap rectangles (e.g., between row12 and row14, no 4/5/3 fills); compared to training patterns, it over-relies on horizontal (matches upper 4/8/9 shapes) but misses chain-based gap/vertical for lower (e.g., expected likely has 7's extending up from row22 into row16 gap, using chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 5-7); without expected, it differs by leaving too many 1's/bg in gaps/verticals, making shapes incomplete (e.g., 4-block in row13-14 not uniform height).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a walled structure (using 1 as proto/walls) with background (likely 0) and colored regions (numbers like 2,3,4,...), where the goal is to fill empty background areas horizontally and vertically based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a key row near the bottom of the grid. The filling propagates colors between wall-separated regions only if the bordering colors are adjacent in the chain sequence, using the preceding or matching color from the chain to decide the fill color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is identified from the last row's first cell, assumed to be 0 or empty; all fills target only bg cells without overwriting existing colors or walls.
 * The chain is a sequence of non-bg colors extracted from the second-to-last row (grid[n-2]), representing an ordering of colors that defines valid adjacencies for filling (e.g., colors must appear consecutively in the chain to allow propagation between regions).
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into sections both vertically (stacks of wall rows) and horizontally (within rows); sections are contiguous blocks of rows with at least one proto in them.
 * Vertical filling occurs between non-adjacent vertical sections (with gap rows in between) by identifying "inner" rows in each section (first non-pure-proto/bg row), extracting uniform-color regions in those inners, and filling overlapping horizontal spans in the gap rows with a color from the chain if the bordering region colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling happens within individual rows, between consecutive walls, filling bg in uniform-color regions if bordering colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Subtlety: Regions must be uniform single-color (no mixed colors within a wall-bounded segment) to be considered for filling; scattered same-color cells in a segment don't qualify unless contiguous (code uses min/max j of js, but assumes uniformity).
 * Adjacency in chain is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color based on order (if a then b, return a; if b then a, return b), which might imply directionality in propagation (e.g., fill with the earlier-in-chain color).
 * Easy to miss: Vertical sections skip the last two rows (while i < n-2), assuming the chain and bg rows are at the bottom and not part of sections; inner rows are chosen as the first row in a section with non-proto/bg content.
 * Gaps between sections must have no overlap in filling logic; if sections are adjacent (end1 +1 >= start2), no vertical fill.
 * Chain extraction ignores bg and proto, but assumes the row has meaningful sequence; if chain <2 elements, no filling.
 * Overwriting only bg; existing colors (like special numbers 3-9) stay, so fills don't propagate over pre-placed colors.
 * Grid dimensions: Assumes rectangular (n rows, m cols); early returns if n<3.
 * Potential edge case: Multiple regions per inner row; filling only where horizontal overlaps exist between upper/lower regions.
 * Chain may include duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's), allowing multiple adjacencies; is_adjacent_preceding checks for exact pairs in sequence, not just presence.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it successfully handled all three training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating solid core logic for basic vertical and horizontal filling between wall sections using chain adjacencies.
 * Worked well for identifying bg (0), extracting chain from second-last row, and finding vertical sections excluding bottom two rows.
 * Vertical fill correctly skips adjacent sections and only fills gaps where inner-row regions overlap horizontally and colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Horizontal fill properly identifies regions between walls in rows and fills if adjacent in chain, but only within the same row.
 * What didn't work/may be limited: get_inner_row picks only the first valid row in a section, potentially missing multi-row sections with varying inner content; if a section has no qualifying inner row (all proto/bg), skips entirely.
 * get_regions requires strictly uniform single color per inter-wall segment (set len==1), which works if regions are solid but may fail if input has pre-filled partials or mixed bg/colors; it also takes min/max of js but doesn't ensure full coverage (e.g., holes in region ignored).
 * is_adjacent_preceding is symmetric but biased toward the order in chain (returns the first in pair), which succeeded in training but might not handle reverse propagation or multi-hop chains.
 * No extraction of "objects" per se (e.g., full blobs or connected components); focuses on wall-bounded regions, which is helpful but assumes walls define all boundaries—may miss open areas without walls.
 * horizontal_fill re-extracts regions per row (redundant with get_regions) and uses index k of walls for positioning, which is functional but inefficient; it fills only between consecutive regions in the same row.
 * vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are applied sequentially (vert then horiz), which may overwrite or miss interactions if horiz creates new adjacencies for vert (but since copies grid, it's one-pass).
 * No handling for chain colors not present in regions (fills only if exact match); assumes proto=1 fixed, bg dynamic.
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of wall-section-chain rules but may underfill in complex test cases with multi-layer sections or non-uniform inners.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from lists) with heavy use of 1's as walls/borders, large areas filled with 2's (likely the dominant chain color), and isolated special colors (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) placed in specific positions across rows 3,10,17,23, matching a pattern like staggered "key" placements vertically aligned with the bottom chain row 27: [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,...].
 * It looks partially correct: Upper sections (rows 0-6,8-13) are mostly 2-filled between walls with specials like 4,8,9,6,7,4 in row 3/10, suggesting vertical propagation of 2's where adjacent to chain (assuming 2 is prevalent in chain), and specials are preserved (not overwritten).
 * Middle section (rows 15-19) has expanded 2's in central columns (14-19) with specials 9,4,5,3, indicating horizontal/vertical fills triggered by chain adjacencies (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 9/4/5/3, fill 2 in overlaps).
 * Lower sections (rows 21-25) have narrower 2-fills (columns 20-24) with 7 in row 23, showing localized filling, possibly due to narrower wall sections or no overlap with upper regions.
 * What doesn't look correct: Many areas remain as 1's or potentially unfilled (though output shows no explicit 0's, assuming bg was 0 and filled to 2's where possible); for example, rows 1-2,4-5, etc., mirror row structures but fill only 2's around specials without propagating the specials themselves upward/downward—e.g., the 4 in row 3 col 3 isn't filled vertically into row 2 col 3 (still 2?), suggesting vertical_fill didn't trigger for that pair (perhaps no chain adjacency between 4 and bordering 2, or no gap/overlap). Similarly, central expansions in rows 15-19 seem correct, but lower partial fills (only cols 20-24) differ from upper full-width 2's, possibly missing vertical propagation across full horizontal span if chain doesn't support wider overlaps. Bottom rows 26-28 are all 1's except the chain in 27, which is preserved correctly. Overall, it makes sense for a chain-heavy-2 puzzle but appears incomplete in propagating specials (e.g., no 4/8/9 fills beyond their input positions), which might be expected if the puzzle requires filling gaps with adjacent chain colors including specials; unknown if input had these specials pre-placed or if filling should expand them—differs from expectation of fuller special propagation if chain allows (e.g., if 4 adjacent to 2, why not fill more 4's?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and their properties extracted from the provided data, focusing **only** on those with clear, consistent interactions or effects across **all** train examples (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). I ignored test inputs since they lack outputs for verification of transformations. Interactions are limited to those that are obvious, repeatable, and present in **every** train pair (no assumptions about puzzle-solving logic, no high-level interpretations like "paths" or "matching rules"). 

Only elements with spatial, color, or structural connections that hold true in all cases are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated background properties without ties to others, one-off shade variations like "dark red" vs. "brown", or elements without cross-example effects) are excluded. Where a connection's mechanism is not explainable from the data (e.g., why a specific color is chosen), it is noted as unknown rather than speculated.

#### Core Components
1. **Enclosing Frames**  
   - Properties: Large structures with color (consistently Blue in all train inputs/outputs), holes=1, variable bounding box (bbox) sizes (e.g., [1,1,4,4] or [1,1,5,5]), pixels indicating border-like area (e.g., 8-24, never solid-filled). Arranged in discrete rows (2-4 frames per row, separated by 1-4 unit gaps in x or y).  
   - No changes: Position, size, holes, pixels, and color remain identical from input to output in every train example.

2. **Inner Tokens**  
   - Properties: Small solid-colored squares (holes=0) placed centrally or offset within enclosing frames. Colors vary (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Orange, Pink, Light Blue, Dark Red). Sizes: 1x1 (pixels=1) or 2x2 (pixels=4), with bbox fully nested inside frame bbox. One per frame consistently.  
   - No changes: Position, size, holes, pixels, and color remain identical from input to output in every train example. Never appear outside frames.

3. **Background**  
   - Properties: Large overarching structure (color Maroon in all train examples), high holes (12-16 in input, 7-9 in output), full-canvas bbox (e.g., [0,0,19,19]), high pixels (181-573) representing empty/fillable space. Implicit grid-like layout inferred from bbox alignments.  
   - Changes consistently tied to other components (see interactions below).

4. **Color Key Row**  
   - Properties: Linear bottom row of 6-8 standalone 1x1 solid squares (holes=0, pixels=1 each), colors matching inner token palette (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Pink, Orange, Dark Red, Light Blue). Fixed y-position (e.g., y=11,18,25), spaced evenly in x (gaps of 2 units). Serves as static reference (order varies slightly but purpose consistent).  
   - No changes: Identical in every input/output pair; no interactions with other components beyond color palette overlap.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are the only connections that occur in **every** train input-to-output transformation. They involve direct effects like spatial adjacency, property inheritance, or quantitative changes. No forced or inconsistent links (e.g., no reliable "left vs. right" color inheritance, as it fails in train1 top row and train3 middle row).

1. **Spatial Containment: Enclosing Frames → Inner Tokens**  
   - Effect: Inner token bbox is always fully nested inside its enclosing frame's bbox (e.g., frame [1,1,4,4] contains token [2,2,3,3]). Offset is consistent (e.g., centered or edge-aligned).  
   - Consistency: Holds in all frames across all inputs/outputs. No tokens escape frames; this containment persists unchanged.  
   - Interconnected properties: Frame bbox dimensions directly limit token position; token holes=0 contrasts with frame holes=1, emphasizing nesting.

2. **Adjacency-Based Placement: Enclosing Frames → New Connecting Bars (Output-Only)**  
   - Effect: New solid rectangles (holes=0, pixels=1-6, bar-like bboxes e.g., 1-3 units wide/tall) appear exclusively in gaps between adjacent enclosing frames (horizontal gaps in same row, e.g., x=4 between frames at x=1-3 and x=5-7; vertical gaps between rows, e.g., y=4 or y=12). Not all gaps fill (inconsistent which ones), but when added, they bridge exact gap positions without overlapping frames or tokens.  
   - Consistency: Present in every output (0-7 new bars per example); absent in all inputs. Bars never appear in non-gap areas or isolated.  
   - Interconnected properties: Frame bbox gaps (position differences, e.g., Δx=1-4 or Δy=1-3) directly determine bar bbox placement and size (bars scale to fit gap, e.g., width matches Δx). No bars in examples without frame rows/gaps.

3. **Color Inheritance (Partial): Inner Tokens / Color Key → New Connecting Bars**  
   - Effect: New bars always use a color from the inner tokens or color key palette (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow; no new colors introduced). Specific choice matches an adjacent inner token's color in some cases (e.g., bar next to Green token is Green), but not reliably (fails in ~30% of bars, e.g., train1 vertical Pink bar between Dark Red and Pink tokens).  
   - Consistency: Every bar color is palette-restricted; unknown mechanism for exact selection (cannot explain mismatches without solving).  
   - Interconnected properties: Token colors (or key colors) limit bar color options; bar pixels/size unaffected by color.

4. **Quantitative Impact: New Connecting Bars → Background**  
   - Effect: Background pixels decrease exactly by the total pixels of all new bars (e.g., train1: -32 pixels matching sum of 7 bars' pixels=32; train2: -6; train3: -15). Background holes decrease by 5-7 (proportional to bars added, but exact Δholes unknown). No other changes to background.  
   - Consistency: Exact pixel match in every train pair; holes always decrease but not by a fixed rule.  
   - Interconnected properties: Bar pixels directly subtract from background pixels (additive fill effect); bar count indirectly affects holes (each bar reduces holes by ~1, but inconsistent). Background bbox unchanged.

#### Notes on Limits and Unknowns
- **No other consistent interactions**: E.g., no reliable vertical vs. horizontal bar differences; no frame color effects (all Blue in train); no token movement/duplication (all static); no key row changes or ties beyond color pool. Test inputs show varying frame colors (Red/Maroon), but without outputs, no verified interactions.
- **Unknowns called out**: Exact selection of which gaps get bars (e.g., why train2 adds at x=4 but not x=8 in top row) is unknown—position adjacency is necessary but not sufficient. Bar color rule is partially inherited but unpredictable (e.g., not always left/upper token). Hole decreases in background are consistent in direction but not formulaic.
- **Irrelevant exclusions**: Standalone elements (e.g., maroon inner in test1, but not in train); inconsistent shades (e.g., "dark red" vs. "red" not always interactive); total pixel counts without ties (e.g., frame pixels stable but not affecting others). No high-level "solution" inferred.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 20:50:24] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where background areas (bg) are filled with colors based on propagation rules within and between sections delimited by prototype walls (value 1), using horizontal filling of uniform segments, vertical propagation inside sections, and inter-section filling guided by overlapping colored regions and an adjacency chain extracted from near the bottom of the grid. The chain represents a sequence of colors that determines allowable fills between adjacent but separated colors (a and b can be bridged by a preceding color in the chain if they appear adjacent in it).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (1) acts as walls/barriers that segment the grid into sections; sections are identified by consecutive rows that contain some but not all 1s (mixed proto and non-proto).
 * Background (bg, often 0 or unfilled) is filled only if a segment/region has exactly one non-bg, non-proto color; multi-color segments are not filled.
 * Horizontal filling occurs first across all non-bottom rows, unifying bg in uniform-color gaps between 1s and bridging gaps between adjacent uniform segments if their colors are "adjacent" in the chain (i.e., appear next to each other in chain, filling with the preceding one).
 * Vertical propagation happens only within each section (between section start/end), filling bg in columns if the vertical segment in that column has exactly one color; it expands to cover the min-max range of that color's positions but skips over 1s.
 * Inter-section filling targets gaps between consecutive sections (rows from upper section end+1 to lower start-1), but only in columns where upper and lower "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section) have overlapping uniform colored regions; fill uses chain adjacency, and only bg is overwritten.
 * Chain extraction is from the second-to-last row (n-2), collecting non-bg, non-proto values in order, skipping 1s— this row often contains the "key" sequence of isolated colors separated by 1s.
 * Adjacency check in chain is symmetric (a then b or b then a) but returns the preceding color for filling; if a==b, use a directly.
 * Bottom two rows (n-1 and possibly n-2) are treated specially: n-1 is all 1s or bg, n-2 provides chain; no filling applied to bottom rows.
 * Subtle: "Inner" row for a section is the first row within it that has any non-1, non-bg; if none, skip inter-fill for that section pair.
 * Subtle: Overlap for inter-fill is strict (max start to min end of regions); no fill if no overlap or no chain link.
 * Edge cases: Empty sections, single-row sections, full-proto rows (not sections), grids with n<2 (return as-is), or chain with duplicates/self-adjacencies.
 * No overwriting of existing non-bg colors; only bg is filled. Sections must have mixed rows (some 1s but not all) to qualify—pure non-proto rows aren't sections for vertical prop.
 * Propagation doesn't cross sections vertically or use chain for intra-section fills; chain is only for horizontal bridges and inter-section gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(This extracts the color sequence from the penultimate row, ignoring bg and proto—essential for determining fill colors between adjacent regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(This checks chain for adjacency and returns the bridging color—core for all fill decisions; handles self-match directly.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    n = len(grid)
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as consecutive rows up to n-2 with partial proto coverage—key for scoping vertical and inter-fills; excludes bottom rows.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    # (as provided in attempt; fills uniform segments between protos with their single color, and bridges gaps between adjacent segments using chain)
```
(Helpful for initial horizontal unification across all rows.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    # (as provided; fills vertical bg segments within a section/column if single color present, expanding to min-max of that color)
```
(Helpful for intra-section vertical filling, but note it skips protos and only acts on bg.)

```python
def get_inner(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # (as provided; finds first row in section with any non-proto non-bg for inter-section reference)
```
(Helpful for selecting representative rows for overlap in inter-fills.)

```python
def get_filled_regions(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # (as provided; extracts uniform single-color segments between protos in a row, ignoring bg)
```
(Helpful for identifying regions in inner rows for overlap checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, indicating solid implementation of horizontal filling, section detection, vertical propagation within sections, and basic inter-section filling via chain.
 * What worked: Chain extraction accurately pulls the key sequence; horizontal_fill unifies bg in uniform gaps and bridges via chain adjacency; vertical_propagate_within properly scopes to sections and fills single-color verticals without crossing walls; section finding skips bottom rows and pure rows correctly.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, large areas are over-filled with 2 (likely from chain having many 2s or self-adjacency), but isolated higher numbers (e.g., 4,8,9 in rows 3,10,17) are preserved as "seeds" without surrounding fills, suggesting incomplete propagation around them—expected more bridging if chain allows (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 4 in chain, gaps near 4 should fill with preceding color, but appear as bg or unfilled in output? Wait, output shows 2s around them, but perhaps not vertically between sections).
 * Missed potential: Inter-section filling seems limited; in test output, the lower section (rows ~20-25) has 2s only on the right, with left all 1s, but if overlaps exist with upper sections' inner rows (which have scattered 4,8,etc.), more fills expected in gaps (rows 11-16? appear all 2s, but row 17 has mixed—perhaps sections misidentified).
 * extract_chain is essential and correct (pulls from n-2, which in test output became [1,4,1,8,...] after fills? No, chain extracted before fills, so from input's n-2).
 * horizontal_fill is helpful but may over-apply bridges if chain has long 2-2 sequences, leading to uniform 2 floods.
 * vertical_propagate_within is mostly correct but in test, columns with mixed seeds (e.g., col 3 has 4 in row3, 6 in row10, 9 in row17) aren't unified vertically across sections, which is intended (only within), but gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) remain 2-filled horizontally, potentially correct if no overlap trigger.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are essential for inter-fills but may fail if inner row is all bg after horizontal (test output has inner rows with seeds like row3, so okay); however, overlaps might be too narrow, missing wider fills.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though find_sections excludes i >= n-2 strictly, which is good but subtle if input has proto in bottom.

**Test output:**
 * The test output fills most of the grid with 2s in large horizontal bands (e.g., rows 1-2,4-9,11-16,18-20,22-23,25-26), preserving isolated higher colors (4,8,9 in row3; 6,7,4 in row10; 9,4,2,5,3 in row17; 7 in row23) surrounded by 2s or 1s, which makes sense if 2 is a dominant chain color and seeds are non-propagated starts.
 * It looks partially correct: Bottom row all 1s (untouched), second-last all 1s (perhaps input was mixed, but filled to proto? No, code doesn't fill bottom), chain row (row 27 in output) has isolated 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7 separated by 1s, matching expected chain preservation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 20-25) has 2s only in columns 20-24, with left side all 1s—no vertical propagation or inter-fill into left bg areas, suggesting missed overlaps with upper mixed rows (e.g., row17 has colors up to col23, should overlap and fill gaps above row20 if chain links, but remains 1/bg? Output shows 1s, implying no fill triggered—perhaps get_inner picks a row without left colors).
 * Gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) are fully 2-filled horizontally, which seems correct if upper/lower inners overlap in cols 3,10,22 (where seeds are) and chain has 2-4/2-8 etc., but vertically in those columns, bg above/below seeds isn't filled (e.g., col3 row4=2, but if vertical prop within section, why not extend from seed? Sections may not include seed rows if they are full-mixed).
 * Row 0 and row 28 all 1s (top/bottom borders, correct untouched). Row 21 all 1s? Wait, output row20 is mixed 1s and 2s on right—looks like partial section. Overall, over-reliance on 2 suggests chain starts/bridges with 2, but scattered seeds in row17 (cols 3,9,11,15-16,18,22) aren't bridged horizontally in that row (gaps are 2s, but if multi-color, no fill—correct, but expected more inter-fill below).
 * The output makes sense for a 2-dominant fill but misses potential fills in left-lower areas and between scattered seeds, differing from expectation of fuller propagation if sections/overlaps are broader; unknown if input had more bg in lower left, but output leaves it as 1s (proto? or bg not filled—code sets bg to colors, but if input 1s, untouched).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 20:50:50] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and their properties derived from the provided data. I focus only on obvious, consistent interactions or connections that appear in **every** train input/output pair (and are structurally present in test inputs where applicable). These are limited to direct, observable relationships like positional containment, overlap effects, or property mappings that do not vary across examples. I exclude the bottom palette row entirely, as it shows no changes, additions, removals, or interactions with other elements in any example (consistent static presence only). I do not speculate on puzzle semantics, rules, or overall purpose. Where a transformation or effect cannot be directly explained by consistent properties (e.g., exact positioning logic for new elements), I note it as unknown.

#### Components Identified
- **Large frames**: Variable color (e.g., Blue in train 1/2/3 inputs, Red in test 1, Maroon in test 2); holes=1; rectangular bbox (e.g., width/height 3-4 units in train 1/2, 5 units in train 3); pixels=8-24 (proportional to bbox area minus internal space); arranged in irregular grid-like patterns (e.g., 2-3 per row, varying rows).
- **Small filled shapes**: Variable color (e.g., Red, Green, Orange, etc., matching colors in other components); holes=0; small rectangular bbox (e.g., 1x1 to 2x2 units); pixels=1-4 (equal to bbox area, indicating solid fill); appear inside or adjacent to large frames.
- **Background canvas**: Variable color (Maroon in train 1/2/3, Blue in test 1/2); high holes (12-22); full-scene bbox (e.g., [0,0,19,19] or larger); high pixels (181-573, representing filled area); encompasses all other elements.
- **Connecting bars** (output-only): Variable color (matching small filled shape colors); holes=0; rectangular bbox (1-5 units in one dimension, often elongated horizontally or vertically); pixels=1-6 (equal to bbox area, indicating solid fill); appear adjacent to or aligned with existing small filled shapes.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections
These are properties or effects that link components and are identical across all three train input/output pairs (and structurally align in test inputs, though no outputs provided). Only direct, non-inferential links are included.

1. **Positional containment: Small filled shapes within large frames**
   - Property: Bbox of each small filled shape is fully contained within the bbox of a large frame (e.g., [2,2,3,3] inside [1,1,4,4] in train 1; [3,3,3,3] inside [1,1,5,5] in train 3).
   - Interaction: Position of small filled shape (bbox coordinates) directly maps to an interior position within a large frame's bbox; no small filled shapes exist outside frames in inputs.
   - Consistency: Occurs for every small filled shape in all train inputs; large frames remain unchanged in outputs (same positions, no new frames added/removed).
   - Effect: No transformation in inputs; in outputs, original small filled shapes retain exact same bbox and properties (no movement or alteration).

2. **Encompassment: All elements within background canvas**
   - Property: Bbox of every large frame and small filled shape is fully contained within the background canvas's bbox (e.g., all elements within [0,0,19,19] in train 1).
   - Interaction: Position of all other components (bbox x/y coordinates) is subset of background canvas bbox; background acts as spatial container.
   - Consistency: True for all elements in every train input and output, and all test inputs.
   - Effect: No change in inputs; in outputs, background bbox remains fixed, but holes decrease (e.g., 16→9 in train 1, 15→9 in train 2, 12→7 in train 3) and pixels decrease by exact sum of all new connecting bars' pixels (e.g., decrease of 32 in train 1 matches total new pixels added).

3. **Color mapping: Shared color set across small filled shapes and connecting bars**
   - Property: Colors of small filled shapes and connecting bars are from a consistent set (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Pink, Dark Red, Orange, Light Blue in train 1; similar in others).
   - Interaction: Color of each connecting bar (output-only) exactly matches the color of at least one existing small filled shape (e.g., new Green bar matches existing Green small shape in train 1/2/3; new Yellow bar matches existing Yellow in all).
   - Consistency: Every connecting bar in all train outputs uses a color already present in that example's small filled shapes; no new colors introduced.
   - Effect: Color propagation from small filled shapes to connecting bars; exact selection rule (e.g., which specific small shape's color) is unknown.

4. **Positional alignment: Connecting bars adjacent to small filled shapes**
   - Property: Bbox of each connecting bar shares at least one coordinate axis with an existing small filled shape's bbox (e.g., same x-range for vertical alignment, same y-range for horizontal; [11,14,13,15] shares y=14-15 with [8,14,9,15] in train 1).
   - Interaction: Position of connecting bar (bbox) is aligned horizontally (same y-coordinates) or vertically (same x-coordinates) with a nearby small filled shape; bars do not overlap existing shapes but are adjacent or gapped by 1 unit.
   - Consistency: Every connecting bar in all train outputs aligns this way with at least one small filled shape; no bars appear in isolated positions.
   - Effect: Adds new filled area without altering original small filled shapes; overlaps background canvas (reducing its pixels/holes as noted above). Exact gap size, direction (left/right/up/down), or length determination is unknown.

5. **Property preservation: Holes and fill integrity**
   - Property: Large frames always have holes=1; all small filled shapes and connecting bars always have holes=0; background always has holes >7.
   - Interaction: Holes property of small filled shapes/connecting bars (0) contrasts with large frames (1), indicating no internal voids in fills; background's high holes are reduced by addition of hole=0 elements.
   - Consistency: Unchanged across all inputs/outputs; every new connecting bar inherits holes=0 from small filled shapes.
   - Effect: Maintains solid fill (pixels = bbox area) for all non-frame elements; background holes reduction correlates with number of new bars (e.g., ~5-7 bars added per train output, holes drop by 5-7), but exact mapping unknown.

#### Notes on Unknowns and Exclusions
- **Transformations not explained**: The precise logic for generating connecting bars (e.g., why a bar extends horizontally in one case vs. vertically in another, or how bbox dimensions are calculated) is unknown and inconsistent in pattern across examples (e.g., 1-unit vs. 3-unit lengths). I do not infer or force rules.
- **Irrelevant or inconsistent elements**: No interactions found for palette row (static, no overlap/alignment/change). Background color varies (Maroon vs. Blue) but does not affect other properties consistently. No evidence of color → position effects (e.g., specific color always causing horizontal movement) or holes → color mappings across all examples. Large frame colors do not consistently influence small shapes or bars.
- **Test inputs**: Align with train structures (e.g., containment, encompassment, color sets), but no outputs provided, so no new interactions derived. No forced connections (e.g., test 1's Red frames do not introduce unique effects).

[2025-09-30 20:54:33] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1). The filling propagates colors from the chain into background areas, but only where components are adjacent in the chain and connect properly through the grid's outlined shapes, without overfilling or ignoring vertical extensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is consistently the dominant filler (e.g., 8 in training examples 1 and 2, 1 in example 3 and test), identified from the bottom-left of the last row; all empty spaces start as bg.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row (n-2), filtering non-bg cells to form a sequence of colors that serves as a key for filling; positions in the chain matter for adjacency (e.g., colors at positions differing by 1 are adjacent).
 * "Proto" is the outline color (e.g., 1), found in rows above the chain by identifying rows with exactly one non-bg color; this acts as a boundary or connector, and fillings should not overwrite proto but can bridge through gaps in proto-outlined regions.
 * Components in each row (i < n-2) are contiguous non-bg segments; for each row, identify sub-components (groups of same-color cells), excluding bg and proto, and assign a primary color (proto if no other, or the dominant non-proto/bg color).
 * Filling occurs only between adjacent components in the same row if their colors are adjacent in the chain (checked via position proximity in chain, e.g., any pair of positions abs(diff)==1); gaps are filled with the chain's color at the minimal position of the adjacent pair.
 * Subtlety: Filling is horizontal within rows but must account for vertical propagation or extension from the chain upwards, especially into all-bg areas directly above chain positions (e.g., creating vertical blobs like 2x3 in train1 rows 6-7); the current program only fills horizontally and skips proto-adjacent cases, missing these verticals.
 * Do not fill if either component involves proto (current skip condition is too broad: "if comps[k][2] == proto or comps[k + 1][2] == proto: continue"), which prevents necessary bridging.
 * Chain adjacency check uses all positions of a color (pos1 + pos2), finding min_p for fill color, but fails if colors appear multiple times non-adjacently; this works for simple cases but misses multi-occurrence logic.
 * Grids have varying widths (20 in train1/2, 27 in train3, 29 in test); ensure m = len(grid[0]) handles this.
 * Outlined shapes (e.g., 1's forming boundaries around inner colors like 2,3,4) suggest enclosed regions that should be filled consistently with chain colors, but only where connected vertically/horizontally without crossing outlines.
 * Last two rows are fixed (chain in n-2, bg in n-1); processing only affects rows 0 to n-3.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical stacking of fillings (e.g., expected train1 has 3-row vertical 2's and 6's in rows 6-8, but generated has none); program doesn't propagate upwards iteratively.
 * No diagonal connections; only orthogonal (horizontal in row, vertical implied by chain position).
 * Colors 2-9 are fillers; 1/8 often bg or proto, but bg varies per grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    return [grid[n-2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n-2][j] != bg]

# Helpful inline snippet: Find proto (outline color)
def find_proto(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> int:
    for row in grid[:-2]:
        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:
    non_bg_pos = [j for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] != bg]
    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where numbers represent colors or barriers: 1 acts as walls/barriers (proto), 8 is typically background (bg), other numbers (2-9) are specific colors to propagate and fill into bg areas. The goal is to fill bg cells with appropriate colors based on connected uniform regions, vertical/horizontal propagation within wall-bounded sections, and gap-filling between sections using adjacency rules derived from a "chain" (likely a key sequence) extracted from near the bottom of the grid, ensuring shapes and separations match implied puzzle logic like nonograms or region-filling with constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into segments/regions both horizontally (within rows) and vertically (across rows); sections are defined as consecutive rows that contain some 1's but are not entirely 1's, and propagation must respect these boundaries without crossing full-1 rows or unrelated areas.
 * Background (bg, usually 8) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows; it must be filled only where a uniform color can be inferred from adjacent non-bg/non-proto cells, but never overwrite existing colors or 1's.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row, capturing non-bg/non-proto cells as a sequence of colors (e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in train1); this acts as an adjacency key—fills between regions use a color from the chain only if two adjacent regions' colors (a and b) appear next to each other in the chain, preferring the "preceding" one in the pair.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, segments between 1's (or edges) should be filled with a single color if all non-bg/non-proto cells in that segment share one color; bg cells in the segment get that color, but gaps between filled segments (still bg) get filled via chain if the bounding segments' colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a detected section (consecutive partial-1 rows), fill vertically column-by-column: if a vertical segment between 1's has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, propagate that color to all bg cells in that vertical run; do not cross 1's or section boundaries.
 * Gap filling between sections: For gaps (all-8 or partial rows) between two sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section), get their horizontal filled regions, and for overlapping column ranges between upper/lower regions with colors a/b, if a and b are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rectangle (overlapping columns, all gap rows) with the preceding color from the chain pair; only fill bg or 1's in those positions (but 1's might be subtle—avoid overwriting true walls?).
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency is bidirectional but returns the "preceding" color in the pair (e.g., if chain has ...a,b..., fill with a; if ...b,a..., fill with b); sections must exclude the last two rows (header/footer?); inner row selection picks the first row in a section with any non-1/bg, but if none, skip; do not fill if segment colors aren't uniform (len(seg_colors)==1); gaps only if gap_start <= gap_end; vertical propagation skips 1's but fills around them if uniform; chain extraction ignores bg and 1's but preserves order; in multi-row uniform blocks, ensure consistency across rows; bottom row (and possibly second-bottom) is the key and should remain unchanged; full-8 rows separate sections but aren't sections themselves; overlapping regions in gap-fill use max/min columns for projection.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal fill must happen before vertical/section detection (as in code), but gap-fill after; chain might have duplicates (e.g., two 2's in train1), so adjacency checks all pairs; if no uniform color, leave as bg; vertical fill only within section bounds, not across gaps; in train3, large sections need multi-row consistency; test grid has wider layout with more colors (3-9), so chain likely longer; do not fill the very top/bottom rows unless they fit section rules; bg detection scans only upper rows (n-2) to avoid key contamination.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding but incomplete implementation of propagation and gap-filling rules.
 * Horizontal filling worked partially: In train1, upper sections (rows 1-4) correctly filled uniform 1/2/5/7 segments between 1's, but failed to fill intra-row gaps between segments (e.g., row1 generated 1's but left 7/8 areas as 8's instead of using chain); similar in train2 (filled some 1/2/3/5/7 but left row1's 2-block incomplete) and train3 (filled multi-row 1/3/2/9 blocks but missed vertical consistency in lower sections).
 * Vertical propagation worked somewhat: In train1, it extended colors within sections (e.g., 2's and 5's in rows 2-3), but skipped or failed in wider blocks; in train2, filled rows5-7 correctly for 1/4/6/9 but not row4 gaps; in train3, extended upper 1/3/2 blocks across rows1-5 but left lower sections (rows8-11) with incomplete 4/6 fills (e.g., row9 has 6 but not propagated fully).
 * Section detection worked basically: Correctly identified partial-1 row groups (e.g., train1 sections at rows0-4 and 8-11; train2 at 0-2 and 5-7; train3 at 0-5 and 8-11 and 17-21), excluding full-8 and last two rows, but <n-2 limit missed some lower sections in train3 (e.g., rows17-21 detected but propagation incomplete).
 * Gap filling failed entirely: No fills in inter-section gaps; e.g., train1 generated all-8 rows5-7 where expected has 2/6 blocks (projected from upper/lower), and row12 all-8 vs expected 9/2; train2 row4 all-8 vs expected 3/6/7 blocks; train3 row6-7 and row12-16 all-8 vs expected 9/6 blocks—likely because get_inner returned valid rows but overlap checks (o_l > o_r) or chain adjacency failed (e.g., wrong preceding color or no match); also, perform_gap_fills skipped if no inner or gap too small.
 * Chain extraction worked: For train1, likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] matching bottom; used in horizontal but not effectively in gaps (e.g., 2 and 6 should fill with preceding if adjacent in chain, but didn't).
 * Bg detection worked: 8 correctly identified in all.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: perform_gap_fills is broken (no fills occur, possibly due to strict overlap or fill_c None; overwrites proto=1 in gaps? but shouldn't); get_filled_regions misses non-uniform post-fill; vertical_propagate_within skips too aggressively (leaves bg in multi-color verticals, but examples need uniform check); overall program modifies grid_out in-place but doesn't handle multi-section gaps or chain duplicates well; no function for full-grid uniformity check post-fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete propagation and missing gap fills similar to training failures; e.g., rows1-6 have 4's and 8's filled horizontally but no vertical extension to row6's partial 9's, and row7-8 all 1's (possibly misbg?) where gaps should project colors like 9's from above; rows8-12 fill 6/7/4 but row13 cuts 4's short (ends with 1's instead of full block), suggesting horizontal_fill failed end-segment; row15 has 9/5/3 blocks but row16 all 1's (gap unfilled, should project from row15 to row20's 3/7?); rows21-25 fill 3 then 7's but inconsistently (row21 3's full, rows22-26 7's but row26 all 1's?); bottom key row27 has 4/8/9/etc. unchanged (good), but overall lacks vertical consistency in lower half (e.g., 5/3/7 blocks not propagated up from key projections) and gap rectangles (e.g., between row12 and row14, no 4/5/3 fills); compared to training patterns, it over-relies on horizontal (matches upper 4/8/9 shapes) but misses chain-based gap/vertical for lower (e.g., expected likely has 7's extending up from row22 into row16 gap, using chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 5-7); without expected, it differs by leaving too many 1's/bg in gaps/verticals, making shapes incomplete (e.g., 4-block in row13-14 not uniform height).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where background areas (bg) are filled with colors based on propagation rules within and between sections delimited by prototype walls (value 1), using horizontal filling of uniform segments, vertical propagation inside sections, and inter-section filling guided by overlapping colored regions and an adjacency chain extracted from near the bottom of the grid. The chain represents a sequence of colors that determines allowable fills between adjacent but separated colors (a and b can be bridged by a preceding color in the chain if they appear adjacent in it).

 * Prototype (1) acts as walls/barriers that segment the grid into sections; sections are identified by consecutive rows that contain some but not all 1s (mixed proto and non-proto).
 * Background (bg, often 0 or unfilled) is filled only if a segment/region has exactly one non-bg, non-proto color; multi-color segments are not filled.
 * Horizontal filling occurs first across all non-bottom rows, unifying bg in uniform-color gaps between 1s and bridging gaps between adjacent uniform segments if their colors are "adjacent" in the chain (i.e., appear next to each other in chain, filling with the preceding one).
 * Vertical propagation happens only within each section (between section start/end), filling bg in columns if the vertical segment in that column has exactly one color; it expands to cover the min-max range of that color's positions but skips over 1s.
 * Inter-section filling targets gaps between consecutive sections (rows from upper section end+1 to lower start-1), but only in columns where upper and lower "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section) have overlapping uniform colored regions; fill uses chain adjacency, and only bg is overwritten.
 * Chain extraction is from the second-to-last row (n-2), collecting non-bg, non-proto values in order, skipping 1s— this row often contains the "key" sequence of isolated colors separated by 1s.
 * Adjacency check in chain is symmetric (a then b or b then a) but returns the preceding color for filling; if a==b, use a directly.
 * Bottom two rows (n-1 and possibly n-2) are treated specially: n-1 is all 1s or bg, n-2 provides chain; no filling applied to bottom rows.
 * Subtle: "Inner" row for a section is the first row within it that has any non-1, non-bg; if none, skip inter-fill for that section pair.
 * Subtle: Overlap for inter-fill is strict (max start to min end of regions); no fill if no overlap or no chain link.
 * Edge cases: Empty sections, single-row sections, full-proto rows (not sections), grids with n<2 (return as-is), or chain with duplicates/self-adjacencies.
 * No overwriting of existing non-bg colors; only bg is filled. Sections must have mixed rows (some 1s but not all) to qualify—pure non-proto rows aren't sections for vertical prop.
 * Propagation doesn't cross sections vertically or use chain for intra-section fills; chain is only for horizontal bridges and inter-section gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(This extracts the color sequence from the penultimate row, ignoring bg and proto—essential for determining fill colors between adjacent regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(This checks chain for adjacency and returns the bridging color—core for all fill decisions; handles self-match directly.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    n = len(grid)
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as consecutive rows up to n-2 with partial proto coverage—key for scoping vertical and inter-fills; excludes bottom rows.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    # (as provided in attempt; fills uniform segments between protos with their single color, and bridges gaps between adjacent segments using chain)
```
(Helpful for initial horizontal unification across all rows.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    # (as provided; fills vertical bg segments within a section/column if single color present, expanding to min-max of that color)
```
(Helpful for intra-section vertical filling, but note it skips protos and only acts on bg.)

```python
def get_inner(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # (as provided; finds first row in section with any non-proto non-bg for inter-section reference)
```
(Helpful for selecting representative rows for overlap in inter-fills.)

```python
def get_filled_regions(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # (as provided; extracts uniform single-color segments between protos in a row, ignoring bg)
```
(Helpful for identifying regions in inner rows for overlap checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, indicating solid implementation of horizontal filling, section detection, vertical propagation within sections, and basic inter-section filling via chain.
 * What worked: Chain extraction accurately pulls the key sequence; horizontal_fill unifies bg in uniform gaps and bridges via chain adjacency; vertical_propagate_within properly scopes to sections and fills single-color verticals without crossing walls; section finding skips bottom rows and pure rows correctly.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, large areas are over-filled with 2 (likely from chain having many 2s or self-adjacency), but isolated higher numbers (e.g., 4,8,9 in rows 3,10,17) are preserved as "seeds" without surrounding fills, suggesting incomplete propagation around them—expected more bridging if chain allows (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 4 in chain, gaps near 4 should fill with preceding color, but appear as bg or unfilled in output? Wait, output shows 2s around them, but perhaps not vertically between sections).
 * Missed potential: Inter-section filling seems limited; in test output, the lower section (rows ~20-25) has 2s only on the right, with left all 1s, but if overlaps exist with upper sections' inner rows (which have scattered 4,8,etc.), more fills expected in gaps (rows 11-16? appear all 2s, but row 17 has mixed—perhaps sections misidentified).
 * extract_chain is essential and correct (pulls from n-2, which in test output became [1,4,1,8,...] after fills? No, chain extracted before fills, so from input's n-2).
 * horizontal_fill is helpful but may over-apply bridges if chain has long 2-2 sequences, leading to uniform 2 floods.
 * vertical_propagate_within is mostly correct but in test, columns with mixed seeds (e.g., col 3 has 4 in row3, 6 in row10, 9 in row17) aren't unified vertically across sections, which is intended (only within), but gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) remain 2-filled horizontally, potentially correct if no overlap trigger.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are essential for inter-fills but may fail if inner row is all bg after horizontal (test output has inner rows with seeds like row3, so okay); however, overlaps might be too narrow, missing wider fills.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though find_sections excludes i >= n-2 strictly, which is good but subtle if input has proto in bottom.

**Test output:**
 * The test output fills most of the grid with 2s in large horizontal bands (e.g., rows 1-2,4-9,11-16,18-20,22-23,25-26), preserving isolated higher colors (4,8,9 in row3; 6,7,4 in row10; 9,4,2,5,3 in row17; 7 in row23) surrounded by 2s or 1s, which makes sense if 2 is a dominant chain color and seeds are non-propagated starts.
 * It looks partially correct: Bottom row all 1s (untouched), second-last all 1s (perhaps input was mixed, but filled to proto? No, code doesn't fill bottom), chain row (row 27 in output) has isolated 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7 separated by 1s, matching expected chain preservation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 20-25) has 2s only in columns 20-24, with left side all 1s—no vertical propagation or inter-fill into left bg areas, suggesting missed overlaps with upper mixed rows (e.g., row17 has colors up to col23, should overlap and fill gaps above row20 if chain links, but remains 1/bg? Output shows 1s, implying no fill triggered—perhaps get_inner picks a row without left colors).
 * Gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) are fully 2-filled horizontally, which seems correct if upper/lower inners overlap in cols 3,10,22 (where seeds are) and chain has 2-4/2-8 etc., but vertically in those columns, bg above/below seeds isn't filled (e.g., col3 row4=2, but if vertical prop within section, why not extend from seed? Sections may not include seed rows if they are full-mixed).
 * Row 0 and row 28 all 1s (top/bottom borders, correct untouched). Row 21 all 1s? Wait, output row20 is mixed 1s and 2s on right—looks like partial section. Overall, over-reliance on 2 suggests chain starts/bridges with 2, but scattered seeds in row17 (cols 3,9,11,15-16,18,22) aren't bridged horizontally in that row (gaps are 2s, but if multi-color, no fill—correct, but expected more inter-fill below).
 * The output makes sense for a 2-dominant fill but misses potential fills in left-lower areas and between scattered seeds, differing from expectation of fuller propagation if sections/overlaps are broader; unknown if input had more bg in lower left, but output leaves it as 1s (proto? or bg not filled—code sets bg to colors, but if input 1s, untouched).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a walled structure (using 1 as proto/walls) with background (likely 0) and colored regions (numbers like 2,3,4,...), where the goal is to fill empty background areas horizontally and vertically based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a key row near the bottom of the grid. The filling propagates colors between wall-separated regions only if the bordering colors are adjacent in the chain sequence, using the preceding or matching color from the chain to decide the fill color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is identified from the last row's first cell, assumed to be 0 or empty; all fills target only bg cells without overwriting existing colors or walls.
 * The chain is a sequence of non-bg colors extracted from the second-to-last row (grid[n-2]), representing an ordering of colors that defines valid adjacencies for filling (e.g., colors must appear consecutively in the chain to allow propagation between regions).
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into sections both vertically (stacks of wall rows) and horizontally (within rows); sections are contiguous blocks of rows with at least one proto in them.
 * Vertical filling occurs between non-adjacent vertical sections (with gap rows in between) by identifying "inner" rows in each section (first non-pure-proto/bg row), extracting uniform-color regions in those inners, and filling overlapping horizontal spans in the gap rows with a color from the chain if the bordering region colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling happens within individual rows, between consecutive walls, filling bg in uniform-color regions if bordering colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Subtlety: Regions must be uniform single-color (no mixed colors within a wall-bounded segment) to be considered for filling; scattered same-color cells in a segment don't qualify unless contiguous (code uses min/max j of js, but assumes uniformity).
 * Adjacency in chain is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color based on order (if a then b, return a; if b then a, return b), which might imply directionality in propagation (e.g., fill with the earlier-in-chain color).
 * Easy to miss: Vertical sections skip the last two rows (while i < n-2), assuming the chain and bg rows are at the bottom and not part of sections; inner rows are chosen as the first row in a section with non-proto/bg content.
 * Gaps between sections must have no overlap in filling logic; if sections are adjacent (end1 +1 >= start2), no vertical fill.
 * Chain extraction ignores bg and proto, but assumes the row has meaningful sequence; if chain <2 elements, no filling.
 * Overwriting only bg; existing colors (like special numbers 3-9) stay, so fills don't propagate over pre-placed colors.
 * Grid dimensions: Assumes rectangular (n rows, m cols); early returns if n<3.
 * Potential edge case: Multiple regions per inner row; filling only where horizontal overlaps exist between upper/lower regions.
 * Chain may include duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's), allowing multiple adjacencies; is_adjacent_preceding checks for exact pairs in sequence, not just presence.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it successfully handled all three training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating solid core logic for basic vertical and horizontal filling between wall sections using chain adjacencies.
 * Worked well for identifying bg (0), extracting chain from second-last row, and finding vertical sections excluding bottom two rows.
 * Vertical fill correctly skips adjacent sections and only fills gaps where inner-row regions overlap horizontally and colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Horizontal fill properly identifies regions between walls in rows and fills if adjacent in chain, but only within the same row.
 * What didn't work/may be limited: get_inner_row picks only the first valid row in a section, potentially missing multi-row sections with varying inner content; if a section has no qualifying inner row (all proto/bg), skips entirely.
 * get_regions requires strictly uniform single color per inter-wall segment (set len==1), which works if regions are solid but may fail if input has pre-filled partials or mixed bg/colors; it also takes min/max of js but doesn't ensure full coverage (e.g., holes in region ignored).
 * is_adjacent_preceding is symmetric but biased toward the order in chain (returns the first in pair), which succeeded in training but might not handle reverse propagation or multi-hop chains.
 * No extraction of "objects" per se (e.g., full blobs or connected components); focuses on wall-bounded regions, which is helpful but assumes walls define all boundaries—may miss open areas without walls.
 * horizontal_fill re-extracts regions per row (redundant with get_regions) and uses index k of walls for positioning, which is functional but inefficient; it fills only between consecutive regions in the same row.
 * vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are applied sequentially (vert then horiz), which may overwrite or miss interactions if horiz creates new adjacencies for vert (but since copies grid, it's one-pass).
 * No handling for chain colors not present in regions (fills only if exact match); assumes proto=1 fixed, bg dynamic.
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of wall-section-chain rules but may underfill in complex test cases with multi-layer sections or non-uniform inners.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from lists) with heavy use of 1's as walls/borders, large areas filled with 2's (likely the dominant chain color), and isolated special colors (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) placed in specific positions across rows 3,10,17,23, matching a pattern like staggered "key" placements vertically aligned with the bottom chain row 27: [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,...].
 * It looks partially correct: Upper sections (rows 0-6,8-13) are mostly 2-filled between walls with specials like 4,8,9,6,7,4 in row 3/10, suggesting vertical propagation of 2's where adjacent to chain (assuming 2 is prevalent in chain), and specials are preserved (not overwritten).
 * Middle section (rows 15-19) has expanded 2's in central columns (14-19) with specials 9,4,5,3, indicating horizontal/vertical fills triggered by chain adjacencies (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 9/4/5/3, fill 2 in overlaps).
 * Lower sections (rows 21-25) have narrower 2-fills (columns 20-24) with 7 in row 23, showing localized filling, possibly due to narrower wall sections or no overlap with upper regions.
 * What doesn't look correct: Many areas remain as 1's or potentially unfilled (though output shows no explicit 0's, assuming bg was 0 and filled to 2's where possible); for example, rows 1-2,4-5, etc., mirror row structures but fill only 2's around specials without propagating the specials themselves upward/downward—e.g., the 4 in row 3 col 3 isn't filled vertically into row 2 col 3 (still 2?), suggesting vertical_fill didn't trigger for that pair (perhaps no chain adjacency between 4 and bordering 2, or no gap/overlap). Similarly, central expansions in rows 15-19 seem correct, but lower partial fills (only cols 20-24) differ from upper full-width 2's, possibly missing vertical propagation across full horizontal span if chain doesn't support wider overlaps. Bottom rows 26-28 are all 1's except the chain in 27, which is preserved correctly. Overall, it makes sense for a chain-heavy-2 puzzle but appears incomplete in propagating specials (e.g., no 4/8/9 fills beyond their input positions), which might be expected if the puzzle requires filling gaps with adjacent chain colors including specials; unknown if input had these specials pre-placed or if filling should expand them—differs from expectation of fuller special propagation if chain allows (e.g., if 4 adjacent to 2, why not fill more 4's?).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of components and their properties derived from the provided data. I focus only on obvious, consistent interactions or connections that appear in **every** train input/output pair (and are structurally present in test inputs where applicable). These are limited to direct, observable relationships like positional containment, overlap effects, or property mappings that do not vary across examples. I exclude the bottom palette row entirely, as it shows no changes, additions, removals, or interactions with other elements in any example (consistent static presence only). I do not speculate on puzzle semantics, rules, or overall purpose. Where a transformation or effect cannot be directly explained by consistent properties (e.g., exact positioning logic for new elements), I note it as unknown.

#### Components Identified
- **Large frames**: Variable color (e.g., Blue in train 1/2/3 inputs, Red in test 1, Maroon in test 2); holes=1; rectangular bbox (e.g., width/height 3-4 units in train 1/2, 5 units in train 3); pixels=8-24 (proportional to bbox area minus internal space); arranged in irregular grid-like patterns (e.g., 2-3 per row, varying rows).
- **Small filled shapes**: Variable color (e.g., Red, Green, Orange, etc., matching colors in other components); holes=0; small rectangular bbox (e.g., 1x1 to 2x2 units); pixels=1-4 (equal to bbox area, indicating solid fill); appear inside or adjacent to large frames.
- **Background canvas**: Variable color (Maroon in train 1/2/3, Blue in test 1/2); high holes (12-22); full-scene bbox (e.g., [0,0,19,19] or larger); high pixels (181-573, representing filled area); encompasses all other elements.
- **Connecting bars** (output-only): Variable color (matching small filled shape colors); holes=0; rectangular bbox (1-5 units in one dimension, often elongated horizontally or vertically); pixels=1-6 (equal to bbox area, indicating solid fill); appear adjacent to or aligned with existing small filled shapes.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections
These are properties or effects that link components and are identical across all three train input/output pairs (and structurally align in test inputs, though no outputs provided). Only direct, non-inferential links are included.

1. **Positional containment: Small filled shapes within large frames**
   - Property: Bbox of each small filled shape is fully contained within the bbox of a large frame (e.g., [2,2,3,3] inside [1,1,4,4] in train 1; [3,3,3,3] inside [1,1,5,5] in train 3).
   - Interaction: Position of small filled shape (bbox coordinates) directly maps to an interior position within a large frame's bbox; no small filled shapes exist outside frames in inputs.
   - Consistency: Occurs for every small filled shape in all train inputs; large frames remain unchanged in outputs (same positions, no new frames added/removed).
   - Effect: No transformation in inputs; in outputs, original small filled shapes retain exact same bbox and properties (no movement or alteration).

2. **Encompassment: All elements within background canvas**
   - Property: Bbox of every large frame and small filled shape is fully contained within the background canvas's bbox (e.g., all elements within [0,0,19,19] in train 1).
   - Interaction: Position of all other components (bbox x/y coordinates) is subset of background canvas bbox; background acts as spatial container.
   - Consistency: True for all elements in every train input and output, and all test inputs.
   - Effect: No change in inputs; in outputs, background bbox remains fixed, but holes decrease (e.g., 16→9 in train 1, 15→9 in train 2, 12→7 in train 3) and pixels decrease by exact sum of all new connecting bars' pixels (e.g., decrease of 32 in train 1 matches total new pixels added).

3. **Color mapping: Shared color set across small filled shapes and connecting bars**
   - Property: Colors of small filled shapes and connecting bars are from a consistent set (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow, Pink, Dark Red, Orange, Light Blue in train 1; similar in others).
   - Interaction: Color of each connecting bar (output-only) exactly matches the color of at least one existing small filled shape (e.g., new Green bar matches existing Green small shape in train 1/2/3; new Yellow bar matches existing Yellow in all).
   - Consistency: Every connecting bar in all train outputs uses a color already present in that example's small filled shapes; no new colors introduced.
   - Effect: Color propagation from small filled shapes to connecting bars; exact selection rule (e.g., which specific small shape's color) is unknown.

4. **Positional alignment: Connecting bars adjacent to small filled shapes**
   - Property: Bbox of each connecting bar shares at least one coordinate axis with an existing small filled shape's bbox (e.g., same x-range for vertical alignment, same y-range for horizontal; [11,14,13,15] shares y=14-15 with [8,14,9,15] in train 1).
   - Interaction: Position of connecting bar (bbox) is aligned horizontally (same y-coordinates) or vertically (same x-coordinates) with a nearby small filled shape; bars do not overlap existing shapes but are adjacent or gapped by 1 unit.
   - Consistency: Every connecting bar in all train outputs aligns this way with at least one small filled shape; no bars appear in isolated positions.
   - Effect: Adds new filled area without altering original small filled shapes; overlaps background canvas (reducing its pixels/holes as noted above). Exact gap size, direction (left/right/up/down), or length determination is unknown.

5. **Property preservation: Holes and fill integrity**
   - Property: Large frames always have holes=1; all small filled shapes and connecting bars always have holes=0; background always has holes >7.
   - Interaction: Holes property of small filled shapes/connecting bars (0) contrasts with large frames (1), indicating no internal voids in fills; background's high holes are reduced by addition of hole=0 elements.
   - Consistency: Unchanged across all inputs/outputs; every new connecting bar inherits holes=0 from small filled shapes.
   - Effect: Maintains solid fill (pixels = bbox area) for all non-frame elements; background holes reduction correlates with number of new bars (e.g., ~5-7 bars added per train output, holes drop by 5-7), but exact mapping unknown.

#### Notes on Unknowns and Exclusions
- **Transformations not explained**: The precise logic for generating connecting bars (e.g., why a bar extends horizontally in one case vs. vertically in another, or how bbox dimensions are calculated) is unknown and inconsistent in pattern across examples (e.g., 1-unit vs. 3-unit lengths). I do not infer or force rules.
- **Irrelevant or inconsistent elements**: No interactions found for palette row (static, no overlap/alignment/change). Background color varies (Maroon vs. Blue) but does not affect other properties consistently. No evidence of color → position effects (e.g., specific color always causing horizontal movement) or holes → color mappings across all examples. Large frame colors do not consistently influence small shapes or bars.
- **Test inputs**: Align with train structures (e.g., containment, encompassment, color sets), but no outputs provided, so no new interactions derived. No forced connections (e.g., test 1's Red frames do not introduce unique effects).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 21:03:14] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where regions bounded by prototype walls (1) and background (typically 8) are filled with colors (2-9) by propagating single-color dominance within segments, vertically within wall-defined sections, and horizontally/vertically across section gaps if colors are adjacent in a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row; the goal is to complete the grid without overfilling or misapplying rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows (0 to n-3), but only if present; empty grids return unchanged.
 * Chain extraction takes the second-last row (n-2), filtering out bg and proto to get a sequence of colors that defines "adjacency" for filling (e.g., if a and b are neighbors in chain, the preceding color can fill gaps between regions of a and b).
 * Horizontal filling occurs in every upper row (0 to n-3): between proto walls, if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, between adjacent filled segments with colors a and b, if they are adjacent in chain, fill the proto/bg gap with the preceding color from the adjacency.
 * Sections are contiguous blocks of rows (from 0 to n-3) that contain some (but not all) proto cells; these define vertical propagation zones.
 * Vertical propagation within a section: for each column, between proto cells, if the non-bg/non-proto cells in the vertical segment have exactly one color, fill bg cells in that segment with it.
 * Inter-section filling: between consecutive sections, for gap rows, if inner rows of sections have horizontally overlapping filled regions with colors a and b that are adjacent in chain, fill the entire overlapping vertical/horizontal gap area with the preceding color—but only if regions overlap horizontally (max start <= min end +1).
 * Subtlety: get_inner picks the first non-bg/non-proto row in a section as representative for region extraction; this assumes sections have consistent inner structure but can miss if sections have varying filled rows.
 * Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the preceding color (first in the pair), and same colors return themselves; no filling if no adjacency.
 * Proto (1) acts as walls/barriers; bg is never propagated as a color.
 * Edge cases: empty segments, all-proto rows (skipped), no chain (no inter-fills), sections touching (no gap), or non-overlapping regions (no cross-fill).
 * The bottom two rows (n-2 and n-1) are typically the chain and a fixed bottom bar; they are not processed for filling.
 * Overfilling risk: horizontal fill runs before sections, so it can create filled regions used in vertical/inter steps; but vertical only within sections, not across.
 * Assumption: grids are rectangular, colors 1-9, bg dominant in empties.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def detect_bg(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> int:
    n = len(grid)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    m = len(grid[0])
    count = {}
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(m):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != proto:
                count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(Detects background as most frequent non-proto in upper rows; useful for identifying fill target.)

```python
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(grid)
    if n < 2:
        return []
    m = len(grid[0])
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(Extracts the adjacency chain from row n-2, excluding bg/proto; core for determining fill colors between regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(Checks if a and b are adjacent in chain and returns the preceding color; essential for gap filling, handles symmetry.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    n = len(grid)

                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(Identifies contiguous sections of rows with partial proto; useful for scoping vertical propagation.)

```python

```
(Performs horizontal segment filling and gap filling within a row; key for initial color spread.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture: horizontal and vertical propagation work partially, but inter-section gap filling and section detection miss cases.
 * Train 1: Generated filled upper sections correctly (e.g., 1-2-5-7 blocks in rows 1-4), but failed to fill gap between sections 0-4 and 8-11 (expected 2 in cols 2-3 rows 5-7, 6 in cols 15-16 rows 5-7; generated all 8s); also overfilled row 12 with 9s in cols 8-9 (expected 8s), and misplaced 9s in row 12; bottom chain row 18 has correct sequence but no propagation upward.
 * Train 1: get_inner selected row 8 for second section, but expected fillings suggest propagation from row 9-11; horizontal_fill didn't bridge non-adjacent chain pairs (e.g., 2 and 6 not adjacent in chain [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]).
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled some bg with 1 or 2 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 4=2 but expected 8; row 4 cols 6=3 but expected 8 in a proto-heavy area); missed vertical propagation in section 4-7 (expected isolated 3,6,7 in row 4 cols 6,10,14 but generated 8s); sections misdetected, leading to no gap fill between upper and lower blocks.
 * Train 2: Chain likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] from row 11, but is_adjacent_preceding not applied correctly for cross-section (e.g., no fill for 3-6-7 isolation); horizontal_fill filled some segments but skipped gaps due to multi-color or non-adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated upper sections (rows 1-5 all filled similarly, but expected varied with 8s in some proto areas); missed vertical fills in lower sections (e.g., rows 13-17 expected 6 in col 11, but generated 8s; rows 17-21 expected isolated 8s but filled with 1s erroneously); inter-section gap (rows 6-7 and 12) not filled (expected 9 in row 6 col 19, 6 in rows 13-17 col 11).
 * Train 3: Larger grid (27 cols) exposed section detection bug—find_sections skipped some partial-proto rows (e.g., row 20 has partial but treated as full bg); vertical_propagate_within overfilled 1s into bg areas; chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] not used for gaps between multi-section blocks.
 * Overall: horizontal_fill works for single-color segments but fails gap fills if chain order wrong or segments not adjacent; vertical_propagate_within skips multi-color verticals correctly but doesn't handle section edges; inter-section logic in program() buggy—get_filled_regions uses inner row only, missing if inner has no fills yet, and overlap check (max(st1,st2) <= min(en1,en2)+1) too strict, preventing non-exact overlaps; no iteration (fills don't propagate after initial horizontal).
 * Function vertical_propagate_within is helpful but limited to sections—extend to full columns? But no, rules confine to sections.
 * Function get_filled_regions is similar to horizontal_fill logic but extracts only—useful but redundant if run after fills.
 * Function get_inner assumes first non-empty row, but if sections have bg-only inners initially, returns None and skips fills (bug in trains).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows uniform block fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4s in cols 1-5, 8s in 8-12; rows 8-13 6s/7s/4s) suggesting horizontal_fill worked for large segments, but vertical propagation seems absent or incomplete (e.g., no blending between row blocks 6-7 and 8-14, which should be sections separated by all-1 rows); inter-section gaps (rows 7,14,21) remain all 1s (proto?), but expected would fill based on chain adjacency if blocks like 4-8-9 adjacent.
 * Test output over-relies on horizontal: entire rows filled uniformly without vertical consistency (e.g., row 15-20 has 9-4-5-3 blocks, but no upward propagation from chain row 27 [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] into gaps); chain includes 1s (proto?), which shouldn't be in chain—extract_chain filters them, but output suggests misdetection (bg=1? but 1 is proto, detect_bg skips proto so bg likely another).
 * Test output misses subtle overlaps: e.g., if sections at rows 0-6 (4/8/9) and 8-13 (6/7/4), gap row 7 should fill where 4 and 6 adjacent in chain (preceding color), but remains 1s; similarly, lower sections not bridged (e.g., 9 and 4 in rows 15-20 and 22-26 should fill row 21 if adjacent).
 * Bg detection likely wrong—upper rows have 1s (proto) and some colors, but if 1 dominates non-proto count? No, detect_bg counts non-proto, so bg= some color like 1? Wait, proto=1 skipped, so bg= most common other (but output fills with colors, not bg); output has 1s as walls but fills bg-spots with colors correctly in blocks, but no gap fills, suggesting inter-section logic broken for large grids (29 cols).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for intra-section fills but ignores chain-based bridging, leaving gaps unfilled—does not match expected full completion.

[2025-09-30 21:03:33] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **all** train input-output pairs (and generally present in test inputs, though tests lack outputs for verification). These are limited to elements that directly interact or affect each other spatially, by color, by properties (e.g., holes, position, size via pixels/bbox), or by transformation (e.g., addition/extension). No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced semantics are included. Only consistent patterns across **every** train example are noted; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., unchanged background fills without direct ties to other components) are excluded. Where a transformation (e.g., addition of a component) occurs consistently but its exact rule cannot be explained from the data, it is called out as unknown.

#### 1. **Large Frames and Inner Small Squares (Containment and Centering Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Large frames (colored outlines, holes=1, large rectangular bbox, high pixels e.g., 8–24; colors: Blue in trains 1–3, Red in test 1, Maroon in test 2) and inner small squares (solid fills, holes=0, small square bbox, low pixels e.g., 1–4).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - Each large frame consistently contains exactly **one** inner small square, positioned at the **center** of the frame's bbox (e.g., for frame bbox [1,1,4,4], inner at [2,2,3,3]; for [1,1,3,3], inner at [2,2,2,2]; for [1,1,5,5], inner at [3,3,3,3]). This spatial centering is direct containment: the inner's bbox is fully nested inside the frame's inner space (the hole=1 area).
     - Property effect: The frame's hole=1 property is directly affected by the inner's presence (fills part of the enclosed space); no frame has holes>1 or multiple inners in inputs. Inner's holes=0 (solid) contrasts with frame's outline nature.
     - Consistency: Present in **every** input frame across all trains/tests; original inners remain unchanged in all outputs (no removal or alteration of existing inners).
     - Transformation: None to the inner itself in outputs; frames remain static.

#### 2. **Bottom Key Row and Overall Color Set (Reference Sequence Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Bottom key row (linear sequence of small solid squares, holes=0, 1-pixel each, fixed y-position near bottom e.g., y=18/11/25/27/28, spaced x-positions) and all inner small squares (plus added bars in outputs).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - The key row provides a fixed sequence of colors (e.g., train 1/2: Red-Green-LightBlue-Yellow-Red-Pink-DarkRed-Orange; train 3: Green-Red-LightBlue-Yellow-Pink-DarkRed; tests have similar sequences with Maroon/Orange/Green inclusions). All colors used in inner small squares (inputs) and added bars (outputs) are **consistently drawn from this exact set** (no new colors introduced beyond the key).
     - Position effect: Key positions (regular x-intervals) indirectly reference grid-like arrangements of frames (e.g., key has 6–8 items matching approximate frame counts per puzzle); no direct spatial overlap, but key colors propagate to inners/added components.
     - Property effect: Key items are always 1-pixel solids (holes=0), serving as a static reference unaffected by other elements.
     - Consistency: Key row is **identical** (positions, colors, sizes) in every input-output pair; all other colored components (inners, added bars) match key colors exactly.
     - Transformation: None; key row unchanged, but its color set consistently affects color choice in added components (see below).

#### 3. **Added Bars and Existing Inner Small Squares (Adjacency and Color Propagation Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Added bars (new in outputs only: rectangular solids, holes=0, larger pixels e.g., 2–6 than 1-pixel key items, elongated bbox e.g., width/height >1 unit) and existing inner small squares (from frames).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - Added bars are consistently positioned **adjacent to or between** existing inner small squares/large frames, either **horizontally** (same y-level, in x-gaps between frames, e.g., train 1 [11,2,13,3]; train 2 [4,2,4,2]; train 3 [6,3,8,3]) or **vertically** (same x-level, in y-gaps between frame rows, e.g., train 1 [2,5,3,7]; train 2 [6,4,6,4]; train 3 [11,12,11,16]).
     - Position effect: Bars "bridge" gaps—horizontal bars connect left/right adjacent inners/frames; vertical bars connect upper/lower inners/frames in the same column. Bbox of bars aligns with the gap size (partial or full fill, e.g., pixels scale with elongation: 2–6 for 1–3 unit spans).
     - Color propagation: Bar color is **always** the same as **one** adjacent inner small square's color (e.g., train 1 horizontal Dark Red matches nearby Dark Red inner; train 2 vertical Green matches adjacent Green inner; train 3 vertical Pink matches nearby Pink inner). Propagated from key color set (per #2).
     - Property effect: Bars have holes=0 (solid, like inners); their addition extends or mirrors inner properties (size via pixels increases for elongation, but color/holes match).
     - Consistency: Added bars appear in **every** train output (none in inputs); always adjacent to inners/frames; color always matches an adjacent inner (never a new color); no adds in isolated areas. In tests, no adds (inputs only), but gap positions exist similarly.
     - Transformation (unknown rule): Bars are added (not present in inputs), filling background gaps and reducing background holes (e.g., 16→9 in train 1; 15→9 in train 2; 12→7 in train 3). Exact trigger for addition (why some gaps get bars, others don't) and choice of which adjacent color to propagate (left/above vs. right/below) is unknown—consistent presence and propagation, but not the decision logic.

#### 4. **Added Bars/Extensions and Background (Filling and Hole Reduction Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Added bars (as above) and background (large fill, many holes e.g., 7–22, full-image bbox, high pixels e.g., 181–573; colors: Maroon in trains, Blue in tests).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - Added bars are placed **within background gaps** (spaces between frames), directly affecting the background by occupying its area.
     - Property effect: Bar addition consistently reduces background pixels by exactly the bars' total pixels (e.g., train 1: -32 background pixels, +32 from bars; train 2: -6/+6; train 3: -15/+15), keeping total image pixels constant. Also reduces background holes (e.g., by merging or filling enclosed spaces; decrease of 6–9 holes per train).
     - Position effect: Bars' bbox overlaps former background areas (no overlap with frames/inners).
     - Consistency: In **every** train output, background properties (pixels, holes) change precisely in response to added bars' total size/location; no other elements affect background. Tests show similar background with holes, but no transformation.
     - Transformation: Background is passively affected (filled); exact hole reduction mechanism (e.g., how one bar splits/merges holes) is unknown, but consistently tied to bar placement/pixels.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable hole count → color links; no consistent shape transformations beyond addition; frame colors do not propagate to bars/inners; test variations like frame color changes do not affect core patterns). Irrelevant elements (e.g., empty grid cells without components) show no interactions.

[2025-09-30 21:06:41] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1). The filling propagates colors from the chain into background areas, but only where components are adjacent in the chain and connect properly through the grid's outlined shapes, without overfilling or ignoring vertical extensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is consistently the dominant filler (e.g., 8 in training examples 1 and 2, 1 in example 3 and test), identified from the bottom-left of the last row; all empty spaces start as bg.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row (n-2), filtering non-bg cells to form a sequence of colors that serves as a key for filling; positions in the chain matter for adjacency (e.g., colors at positions differing by 1 are adjacent).
 * "Proto" is the outline color (e.g., 1), found in rows above the chain by identifying rows with exactly one non-bg color; this acts as a boundary or connector, and fillings should not overwrite proto but can bridge through gaps in proto-outlined regions.
 * Components in each row (i < n-2) are contiguous non-bg segments; for each row, identify sub-components (groups of same-color cells), excluding bg and proto, and assign a primary color (proto if no other, or the dominant non-proto/bg color).
 * Filling occurs only between adjacent components in the same row if their colors are adjacent in the chain (checked via position proximity in chain, e.g., any pair of positions abs(diff)==1); gaps are filled with the chain's color at the minimal position of the adjacent pair.
 * Subtlety: Filling is horizontal within rows but must account for vertical propagation or extension from the chain upwards, especially into all-bg areas directly above chain positions (e.g., creating vertical blobs like 2x3 in train1 rows 6-7); the current program only fills horizontally and skips proto-adjacent cases, missing these verticals.
 * Do not fill if either component involves proto (current skip condition is too broad: "if comps[k][2] == proto or comps[k + 1][2] == proto: continue"), which prevents necessary bridging.
 * Chain adjacency check uses all positions of a color (pos1 + pos2), finding min_p for fill color, but fails if colors appear multiple times non-adjacently; this works for simple cases but misses multi-occurrence logic.
 * Grids have varying widths (20 in train1/2, 27 in train3, 29 in test); ensure m = len(grid[0]) handles this.
 * Outlined shapes (e.g., 1's forming boundaries around inner colors like 2,3,4) suggest enclosed regions that should be filled consistently with chain colors, but only where connected vertically/horizontally without crossing outlines.
 * Last two rows are fixed (chain in n-2, bg in n-1); processing only affects rows 0 to n-3.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical stacking of fillings (e.g., expected train1 has 3-row vertical 2's and 6's in rows 6-8, but generated has none); program doesn't propagate upwards iteratively.
 * No diagonal connections; only orthogonal (horizontal in row, vertical implied by chain position).
 * Colors 2-9 are fillers; 1/8 often bg or proto, but bg varies per grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    return [grid[n-2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n-2][j] != bg]

# Helpful inline snippet: Find proto (outline color)
def find_proto(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> int:
    for row in grid[:-2]:
        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:
    non_bg_pos = [j for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] != bg]
    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where regions bounded by prototype walls (1) and background (typically 8) are filled with colors (2-9) by propagating single-color dominance within segments, vertically within wall-defined sections, and horizontally/vertically across section gaps if colors are adjacent in a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row; the goal is to complete the grid without overfilling or misapplying rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows (0 to n-3), but only if present; empty grids return unchanged.
 * Chain extraction takes the second-last row (n-2), filtering out bg and proto to get a sequence of colors that defines "adjacency" for filling (e.g., if a and b are neighbors in chain, the preceding color can fill gaps between regions of a and b).
 * Horizontal filling occurs in every upper row (0 to n-3): between proto walls, if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, between adjacent filled segments with colors a and b, if they are adjacent in chain, fill the proto/bg gap with the preceding color from the adjacency.
 * Sections are contiguous blocks of rows (from 0 to n-3) that contain some (but not all) proto cells; these define vertical propagation zones.
 * Vertical propagation within a section: for each column, between proto cells, if the non-bg/non-proto cells in the vertical segment have exactly one color, fill bg cells in that segment with it.
 * Inter-section filling: between consecutive sections, for gap rows, if inner rows of sections have horizontally overlapping filled regions with colors a and b that are adjacent in chain, fill the entire overlapping vertical/horizontal gap area with the preceding color—but only if regions overlap horizontally (max start <= min end +1).
 * Subtlety: get_inner picks the first non-bg/non-proto row in a section as representative for region extraction; this assumes sections have consistent inner structure but can miss if sections have varying filled rows.
 * Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the preceding color (first in the pair), and same colors return themselves; no filling if no adjacency.
 * Proto (1) acts as walls/barriers; bg is never propagated as a color.
 * Edge cases: empty segments, all-proto rows (skipped), no chain (no inter-fills), sections touching (no gap), or non-overlapping regions (no cross-fill).
 * The bottom two rows (n-2 and n-1) are typically the chain and a fixed bottom bar; they are not processed for filling.
 * Overfilling risk: horizontal fill runs before sections, so it can create filled regions used in vertical/inter steps; but vertical only within sections, not across.
 * Assumption: grids are rectangular, colors 1-9, bg dominant in empties.

```
(Performs horizontal segment filling and gap filling within a row; key for initial color spread.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture: horizontal and vertical propagation work partially, but inter-section gap filling and section detection miss cases.
 * Train 1: Generated filled upper sections correctly (e.g., 1-2-5-7 blocks in rows 1-4), but failed to fill gap between sections 0-4 and 8-11 (expected 2 in cols 2-3 rows 5-7, 6 in cols 15-16 rows 5-7; generated all 8s); also overfilled row 12 with 9s in cols 8-9 (expected 8s), and misplaced 9s in row 12; bottom chain row 18 has correct sequence but no propagation upward.
 * Train 1: get_inner selected row 8 for second section, but expected fillings suggest propagation from row 9-11; horizontal_fill didn't bridge non-adjacent chain pairs (e.g., 2 and 6 not adjacent in chain [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]).
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled some bg with 1 or 2 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 4=2 but expected 8; row 4 cols 6=3 but expected 8 in a proto-heavy area); missed vertical propagation in section 4-7 (expected isolated 3,6,7 in row 4 cols 6,10,14 but generated 8s); sections misdetected, leading to no gap fill between upper and lower blocks.
 * Train 2: Chain likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] from row 11, but is_adjacent_preceding not applied correctly for cross-section (e.g., no fill for 3-6-7 isolation); horizontal_fill filled some segments but skipped gaps due to multi-color or non-adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated upper sections (rows 1-5 all filled similarly, but expected varied with 8s in some proto areas); missed vertical fills in lower sections (e.g., rows 13-17 expected 6 in col 11, but generated 8s; rows 17-21 expected isolated 8s but filled with 1s erroneously); inter-section gap (rows 6-7 and 12) not filled (expected 9 in row 6 col 19, 6 in rows 13-17 col 11).
 * Train 3: Larger grid (27 cols) exposed section detection bug—find_sections skipped some partial-proto rows (e.g., row 20 has partial but treated as full bg); vertical_propagate_within overfilled 1s into bg areas; chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] not used for gaps between multi-section blocks.
 * Overall: horizontal_fill works for single-color segments but fails gap fills if chain order wrong or segments not adjacent; vertical_propagate_within skips multi-color verticals correctly but doesn't handle section edges; inter-section logic in program() buggy—get_filled_regions uses inner row only, missing if inner has no fills yet, and overlap check (max(st1,st2) <= min(en1,en2)+1) too strict, preventing non-exact overlaps; no iteration (fills don't propagate after initial horizontal).
 * Function vertical_propagate_within is helpful but limited to sections—extend to full columns? But no, rules confine to sections.
 * Function get_filled_regions is similar to horizontal_fill logic but extracts only—useful but redundant if run after fills.
 * Function get_inner assumes first non-empty row, but if sections have bg-only inners initially, returns None and skips fills (bug in trains).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows uniform block fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4s in cols 1-5, 8s in 8-12; rows 8-13 6s/7s/4s) suggesting horizontal_fill worked for large segments, but vertical propagation seems absent or incomplete (e.g., no blending between row blocks 6-7 and 8-14, which should be sections separated by all-1 rows); inter-section gaps (rows 7,14,21) remain all 1s (proto?), but expected would fill based on chain adjacency if blocks like 4-8-9 adjacent.
 * Test output over-relies on horizontal: entire rows filled uniformly without vertical consistency (e.g., row 15-20 has 9-4-5-3 blocks, but no upward propagation from chain row 27 [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] into gaps); chain includes 1s (proto?), which shouldn't be in chain—extract_chain filters them, but output suggests misdetection (bg=1? but 1 is proto, detect_bg skips proto so bg likely another).
 * Test output misses subtle overlaps: e.g., if sections at rows 0-6 (4/8/9) and 8-13 (6/7/4), gap row 7 should fill where 4 and 6 adjacent in chain (preceding color), but remains 1s; similarly, lower sections not bridged (e.g., 9 and 4 in rows 15-20 and 22-26 should fill row 21 if adjacent).
 * Bg detection likely wrong—upper rows have 1s (proto) and some colors, but if 1 dominates non-proto count? No, detect_bg counts non-proto, so bg= some color like 1? Wait, proto=1 skipped, so bg= most common other (but output fills with colors, not bg); output has 1s as walls but fills bg-spots with colors correctly in blocks, but no gap fills, suggesting inter-section logic broken for large grids (29 cols).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for intra-section fills but ignores chain-based bridging, leaving gaps unfilled—does not match expected full completion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where numbers represent colors or barriers: 1 acts as walls/barriers (proto), 8 is typically background (bg), other numbers (2-9) are specific colors to propagate and fill into bg areas. The goal is to fill bg cells with appropriate colors based on connected uniform regions, vertical/horizontal propagation within wall-bounded sections, and gap-filling between sections using adjacency rules derived from a "chain" (likely a key sequence) extracted from near the bottom of the grid, ensuring shapes and separations match implied puzzle logic like nonograms or region-filling with constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into segments/regions both horizontally (within rows) and vertically (across rows); sections are defined as consecutive rows that contain some 1's but are not entirely 1's, and propagation must respect these boundaries without crossing full-1 rows or unrelated areas.
 * Background (bg, usually 8) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows; it must be filled only where a uniform color can be inferred from adjacent non-bg/non-proto cells, but never overwrite existing colors or 1's.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row, capturing non-bg/non-proto cells as a sequence of colors (e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in train1); this acts as an adjacency key—fills between regions use a color from the chain only if two adjacent regions' colors (a and b) appear next to each other in the chain, preferring the "preceding" one in the pair.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, segments between 1's (or edges) should be filled with a single color if all non-bg/non-proto cells in that segment share one color; bg cells in the segment get that color, but gaps between filled segments (still bg) get filled via chain if the bounding segments' colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a detected section (consecutive partial-1 rows), fill vertically column-by-column: if a vertical segment between 1's has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, propagate that color to all bg cells in that vertical run; do not cross 1's or section boundaries.
 * Gap filling between sections: For gaps (all-8 or partial rows) between two sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section), get their horizontal filled regions, and for overlapping column ranges between upper/lower regions with colors a/b, if a and b are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rectangle (overlapping columns, all gap rows) with the preceding color from the chain pair; only fill bg or 1's in those positions (but 1's might be subtle—avoid overwriting true walls?).
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency is bidirectional but returns the "preceding" color in the pair (e.g., if chain has ...a,b..., fill with a; if ...b,a..., fill with b); sections must exclude the last two rows (header/footer?); inner row selection picks the first row in a section with any non-1/bg, but if none, skip; do not fill if segment colors aren't uniform (len(seg_colors)==1); gaps only if gap_start <= gap_end; vertical propagation skips 1's but fills around them if uniform; chain extraction ignores bg and 1's but preserves order; in multi-row uniform blocks, ensure consistency across rows; bottom row (and possibly second-bottom) is the key and should remain unchanged; full-8 rows separate sections but aren't sections themselves; overlapping regions in gap-fill use max/min columns for projection.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal fill must happen before vertical/section detection (as in code), but gap-fill after; chain might have duplicates (e.g., two 2's in train1), so adjacency checks all pairs; if no uniform color, leave as bg; vertical fill only within section bounds, not across gaps; in train3, large sections need multi-row consistency; test grid has wider layout with more colors (3-9), so chain likely longer; do not fill the very top/bottom rows unless they fit section rules; bg detection scans only upper rows (n-2) to avoid key contamination.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding but incomplete implementation of propagation and gap-filling rules.
 * Horizontal filling worked partially: In train1, upper sections (rows 1-4) correctly filled uniform 1/2/5/7 segments between 1's, but failed to fill intra-row gaps between segments (e.g., row1 generated 1's but left 7/8 areas as 8's instead of using chain); similar in train2 (filled some 1/2/3/5/7 but left row1's 2-block incomplete) and train3 (filled multi-row 1/3/2/9 blocks but missed vertical consistency in lower sections).
 * Vertical propagation worked somewhat: In train1, it extended colors within sections (e.g., 2's and 5's in rows 2-3), but skipped or failed in wider blocks; in train2, filled rows5-7 correctly for 1/4/6/9 but not row4 gaps; in train3, extended upper 1/3/2 blocks across rows1-5 but left lower sections (rows8-11) with incomplete 4/6 fills (e.g., row9 has 6 but not propagated fully).
 * Section detection worked basically: Correctly identified partial-1 row groups (e.g., train1 sections at rows0-4 and 8-11; train2 at 0-2 and 5-7; train3 at 0-5 and 8-11 and 17-21), excluding full-8 and last two rows, but <n-2 limit missed some lower sections in train3 (e.g., rows17-21 detected but propagation incomplete).
 * Gap filling failed entirely: No fills in inter-section gaps; e.g., train1 generated all-8 rows5-7 where expected has 2/6 blocks (projected from upper/lower), and row12 all-8 vs expected 9/2; train2 row4 all-8 vs expected 3/6/7 blocks; train3 row6-7 and row12-16 all-8 vs expected 9/6 blocks—likely because get_inner returned valid rows but overlap checks (o_l > o_r) or chain adjacency failed (e.g., wrong preceding color or no match); also, perform_gap_fills skipped if no inner or gap too small.
 * Chain extraction worked: For train1, likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] matching bottom; used in horizontal but not effectively in gaps (e.g., 2 and 6 should fill with preceding if adjacent in chain, but didn't).
 * Bg detection worked: 8 correctly identified in all.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: perform_gap_fills is broken (no fills occur, possibly due to strict overlap or fill_c None; overwrites proto=1 in gaps? but shouldn't); get_filled_regions misses non-uniform post-fill; vertical_propagate_within skips too aggressively (leaves bg in multi-color verticals, but examples need uniform check); overall program modifies grid_out in-place but doesn't handle multi-section gaps or chain duplicates well; no function for full-grid uniformity check post-fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete propagation and missing gap fills similar to training failures; e.g., rows1-6 have 4's and 8's filled horizontally but no vertical extension to row6's partial 9's, and row7-8 all 1's (possibly misbg?) where gaps should project colors like 9's from above; rows8-12 fill 6/7/4 but row13 cuts 4's short (ends with 1's instead of full block), suggesting horizontal_fill failed end-segment; row15 has 9/5/3 blocks but row16 all 1's (gap unfilled, should project from row15 to row20's 3/7?); rows21-25 fill 3 then 7's but inconsistently (row21 3's full, rows22-26 7's but row26 all 1's?); bottom key row27 has 4/8/9/etc. unchanged (good), but overall lacks vertical consistency in lower half (e.g., 5/3/7 blocks not propagated up from key projections) and gap rectangles (e.g., between row12 and row14, no 4/5/3 fills); compared to training patterns, it over-relies on horizontal (matches upper 4/8/9 shapes) but misses chain-based gap/vertical for lower (e.g., expected likely has 7's extending up from row22 into row16 gap, using chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 5-7); without expected, it differs by leaving too many 1's/bg in gaps/verticals, making shapes incomplete (e.g., 4-block in row13-14 not uniform height).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where background areas (bg) are filled with colors based on propagation rules within and between sections delimited by prototype walls (value 1), using horizontal filling of uniform segments, vertical propagation inside sections, and inter-section filling guided by overlapping colored regions and an adjacency chain extracted from near the bottom of the grid. The chain represents a sequence of colors that determines allowable fills between adjacent but separated colors (a and b can be bridged by a preceding color in the chain if they appear adjacent in it).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (1) acts as walls/barriers that segment the grid into sections; sections are identified by consecutive rows that contain some but not all 1s (mixed proto and non-proto).
 * Background (bg, often 0 or unfilled) is filled only if a segment/region has exactly one non-bg, non-proto color; multi-color segments are not filled.
 * Horizontal filling occurs first across all non-bottom rows, unifying bg in uniform-color gaps between 1s and bridging gaps between adjacent uniform segments if their colors are "adjacent" in the chain (i.e., appear next to each other in chain, filling with the preceding one).
 * Vertical propagation happens only within each section (between section start/end), filling bg in columns if the vertical segment in that column has exactly one color; it expands to cover the min-max range of that color's positions but skips over 1s.
 * Inter-section filling targets gaps between consecutive sections (rows from upper section end+1 to lower start-1), but only in columns where upper and lower "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section) have overlapping uniform colored regions; fill uses chain adjacency, and only bg is overwritten.
 * Chain extraction is from the second-to-last row (n-2), collecting non-bg, non-proto values in order, skipping 1s— this row often contains the "key" sequence of isolated colors separated by 1s.
 * Adjacency check in chain is symmetric (a then b or b then a) but returns the preceding color for filling; if a==b, use a directly.
 * Bottom two rows (n-1 and possibly n-2) are treated specially: n-1 is all 1s or bg, n-2 provides chain; no filling applied to bottom rows.
 * Subtle: "Inner" row for a section is the first row within it that has any non-1, non-bg; if none, skip inter-fill for that section pair.
 * Subtle: Overlap for inter-fill is strict (max start to min end of regions); no fill if no overlap or no chain link.
 * Edge cases: Empty sections, single-row sections, full-proto rows (not sections), grids with n<2 (return as-is), or chain with duplicates/self-adjacencies.
 * No overwriting of existing non-bg colors; only bg is filled. Sections must have mixed rows (some 1s but not all) to qualify—pure non-proto rows aren't sections for vertical prop.
 * Propagation doesn't cross sections vertically or use chain for intra-section fills; chain is only for horizontal bridges and inter-section gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(This extracts the color sequence from the penultimate row, ignoring bg and proto—essential for determining fill colors between adjacent regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(This checks chain for adjacency and returns the bridging color—core for all fill decisions; handles self-match directly.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    n = len(grid)
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as consecutive rows up to n-2 with partial proto coverage—key for scoping vertical and inter-fills; excludes bottom rows.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    # (as provided in attempt; fills uniform segments between protos with their single color, and bridges gaps between adjacent segments using chain)
```
(Helpful for initial horizontal unification across all rows.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    # (as provided; fills vertical bg segments within a section/column if single color present, expanding to min-max of that color)
```
(Helpful for intra-section vertical filling, but note it skips protos and only acts on bg.)

```python
def get_inner(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # (as provided; finds first row in section with any non-proto non-bg for inter-section reference)
```
(Helpful for selecting representative rows for overlap in inter-fills.)

```python
def get_filled_regions(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # (as provided; extracts uniform single-color segments between protos in a row, ignoring bg)
```
(Helpful for identifying regions in inner rows for overlap checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, indicating solid implementation of horizontal filling, section detection, vertical propagation within sections, and basic inter-section filling via chain.
 * What worked: Chain extraction accurately pulls the key sequence; horizontal_fill unifies bg in uniform gaps and bridges via chain adjacency; vertical_propagate_within properly scopes to sections and fills single-color verticals without crossing walls; section finding skips bottom rows and pure rows correctly.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, large areas are over-filled with 2 (likely from chain having many 2s or self-adjacency), but isolated higher numbers (e.g., 4,8,9 in rows 3,10,17) are preserved as "seeds" without surrounding fills, suggesting incomplete propagation around them—expected more bridging if chain allows (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 4 in chain, gaps near 4 should fill with preceding color, but appear as bg or unfilled in output? Wait, output shows 2s around them, but perhaps not vertically between sections).
 * Missed potential: Inter-section filling seems limited; in test output, the lower section (rows ~20-25) has 2s only on the right, with left all 1s, but if overlaps exist with upper sections' inner rows (which have scattered 4,8,etc.), more fills expected in gaps (rows 11-16? appear all 2s, but row 17 has mixed—perhaps sections misidentified).
 * extract_chain is essential and correct (pulls from n-2, which in test output became [1,4,1,8,...] after fills? No, chain extracted before fills, so from input's n-2).
 * horizontal_fill is helpful but may over-apply bridges if chain has long 2-2 sequences, leading to uniform 2 floods.
 * vertical_propagate_within is mostly correct but in test, columns with mixed seeds (e.g., col 3 has 4 in row3, 6 in row10, 9 in row17) aren't unified vertically across sections, which is intended (only within), but gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) remain 2-filled horizontally, potentially correct if no overlap trigger.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are essential for inter-fills but may fail if inner row is all bg after horizontal (test output has inner rows with seeds like row3, so okay); however, overlaps might be too narrow, missing wider fills.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though find_sections excludes i >= n-2 strictly, which is good but subtle if input has proto in bottom.

**Test output:**
 * The test output fills most of the grid with 2s in large horizontal bands (e.g., rows 1-2,4-9,11-16,18-20,22-23,25-26), preserving isolated higher colors (4,8,9 in row3; 6,7,4 in row10; 9,4,2,5,3 in row17; 7 in row23) surrounded by 2s or 1s, which makes sense if 2 is a dominant chain color and seeds are non-propagated starts.
 * It looks partially correct: Bottom row all 1s (untouched), second-last all 1s (perhaps input was mixed, but filled to proto? No, code doesn't fill bottom), chain row (row 27 in output) has isolated 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7 separated by 1s, matching expected chain preservation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 20-25) has 2s only in columns 20-24, with left side all 1s—no vertical propagation or inter-fill into left bg areas, suggesting missed overlaps with upper mixed rows (e.g., row17 has colors up to col23, should overlap and fill gaps above row20 if chain links, but remains 1/bg? Output shows 1s, implying no fill triggered—perhaps get_inner picks a row without left colors).
 * Gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) are fully 2-filled horizontally, which seems correct if upper/lower inners overlap in cols 3,10,22 (where seeds are) and chain has 2-4/2-8 etc., but vertically in those columns, bg above/below seeds isn't filled (e.g., col3 row4=2, but if vertical prop within section, why not extend from seed? Sections may not include seed rows if they are full-mixed).
 * Row 0 and row 28 all 1s (top/bottom borders, correct untouched). Row 21 all 1s? Wait, output row20 is mixed 1s and 2s on right—looks like partial section. Overall, over-reliance on 2 suggests chain starts/bridges with 2, but scattered seeds in row17 (cols 3,9,11,15-16,18,22) aren't bridged horizontally in that row (gaps are 2s, but if multi-color, no fill—correct, but expected more inter-fill below).
 * The output makes sense for a 2-dominant fill but misses potential fills in left-lower areas and between scattered seeds, differing from expectation of fuller propagation if sections/overlaps are broader; unknown if input had more bg in lower left, but output leaves it as 1s (proto? or bg not filled—code sets bg to colors, but if input 1s, untouched).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a walled structure (using 1 as proto/walls) with background (likely 0) and colored regions (numbers like 2,3,4,...), where the goal is to fill empty background areas horizontally and vertically based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a key row near the bottom of the grid. The filling propagates colors between wall-separated regions only if the bordering colors are adjacent in the chain sequence, using the preceding or matching color from the chain to decide the fill color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is identified from the last row's first cell, assumed to be 0 or empty; all fills target only bg cells without overwriting existing colors or walls.
 * The chain is a sequence of non-bg colors extracted from the second-to-last row (grid[n-2]), representing an ordering of colors that defines valid adjacencies for filling (e.g., colors must appear consecutively in the chain to allow propagation between regions).
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into sections both vertically (stacks of wall rows) and horizontally (within rows); sections are contiguous blocks of rows with at least one proto in them.
 * Vertical filling occurs between non-adjacent vertical sections (with gap rows in between) by identifying "inner" rows in each section (first non-pure-proto/bg row), extracting uniform-color regions in those inners, and filling overlapping horizontal spans in the gap rows with a color from the chain if the bordering region colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling happens within individual rows, between consecutive walls, filling bg in uniform-color regions if bordering colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Subtlety: Regions must be uniform single-color (no mixed colors within a wall-bounded segment) to be considered for filling; scattered same-color cells in a segment don't qualify unless contiguous (code uses min/max j of js, but assumes uniformity).
 * Adjacency in chain is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color based on order (if a then b, return a; if b then a, return b), which might imply directionality in propagation (e.g., fill with the earlier-in-chain color).
 * Easy to miss: Vertical sections skip the last two rows (while i < n-2), assuming the chain and bg rows are at the bottom and not part of sections; inner rows are chosen as the first row in a section with non-proto/bg content.
 * Gaps between sections must have no overlap in filling logic; if sections are adjacent (end1 +1 >= start2), no vertical fill.
 * Chain extraction ignores bg and proto, but assumes the row has meaningful sequence; if chain <2 elements, no filling.
 * Overwriting only bg; existing colors (like special numbers 3-9) stay, so fills don't propagate over pre-placed colors.
 * Grid dimensions: Assumes rectangular (n rows, m cols); early returns if n<3.
 * Potential edge case: Multiple regions per inner row; filling only where horizontal overlaps exist between upper/lower regions.
 * Chain may include duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's), allowing multiple adjacencies; is_adjacent_preceding checks for exact pairs in sequence, not just presence.

 * Vertical fill correctly skips adjacent sections and only fills gaps where inner-row regions overlap horizontally and colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Horizontal fill properly identifies regions between walls in rows and fills if adjacent in chain, but only within the same row.
 * What didn't work/may be limited: get_inner_row picks only the first valid row in a section, potentially missing multi-row sections with varying inner content; if a section has no qualifying inner row (all proto/bg), skips entirely.
 * get_regions requires strictly uniform single color per inter-wall segment (set len==1), which works if regions are solid but may fail if input has pre-filled partials or mixed bg/colors; it also takes min/max of js but doesn't ensure full coverage (e.g., holes in region ignored).
 * is_adjacent_preceding is symmetric but biased toward the order in chain (returns the first in pair), which succeeded in training but might not handle reverse propagation or multi-hop chains.
 * No extraction of "objects" per se (e.g., full blobs or connected components); focuses on wall-bounded regions, which is helpful but assumes walls define all boundaries—may miss open areas without walls.
 * horizontal_fill re-extracts regions per row (redundant with get_regions) and uses index k of walls for positioning, which is functional but inefficient; it fills only between consecutive regions in the same row.
 * vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are applied sequentially (vert then horiz), which may overwrite or miss interactions if horiz creates new adjacencies for vert (but since copies grid, it's one-pass).
 * No handling for chain colors not present in regions (fills only if exact match); assumes proto=1 fixed, bg dynamic.
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of wall-section-chain rules but may underfill in complex test cases with multi-layer sections or non-uniform inners.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from lists) with heavy use of 1's as walls/borders, large areas filled with 2's (likely the dominant chain color), and isolated special colors (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) placed in specific positions across rows 3,10,17,23, matching a pattern like staggered "key" placements vertically aligned with the bottom chain row 27: [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,...].
 * It looks partially correct: Upper sections (rows 0-6,8-13) are mostly 2-filled between walls with specials like 4,8,9,6,7,4 in row 3/10, suggesting vertical propagation of 2's where adjacent to chain (assuming 2 is prevalent in chain), and specials are preserved (not overwritten).
 * Middle section (rows 15-19) has expanded 2's in central columns (14-19) with specials 9,4,5,3, indicating horizontal/vertical fills triggered by chain adjacencies (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 9/4/5/3, fill 2 in overlaps).
 * Lower sections (rows 21-25) have narrower 2-fills (columns 20-24) with 7 in row 23, showing localized filling, possibly due to narrower wall sections or no overlap with upper regions.
 * What doesn't look correct: Many areas remain as 1's or potentially unfilled (though output shows no explicit 0's, assuming bg was 0 and filled to 2's where possible); for example, rows 1-2,4-5, etc., mirror row structures but fill only 2's around specials without propagating the specials themselves upward/downward—e.g., the 4 in row 3 col 3 isn't filled vertically into row 2 col 3 (still 2?), suggesting vertical_fill didn't trigger for that pair (perhaps no chain adjacency between 4 and bordering 2, or no gap/overlap). Similarly, central expansions in rows 15-19 seem correct, but lower partial fills (only cols 20-24) differ from upper full-width 2's, possibly missing vertical propagation across full horizontal span if chain doesn't support wider overlaps. Bottom rows 26-28 are all 1's except the chain in 27, which is preserved correctly. Overall, it makes sense for a chain-heavy-2 puzzle but appears incomplete in propagating specials (e.g., no 4/8/9 fills beyond their input positions), which might be expected if the puzzle requires filling gaps with adjacent chain colors including specials; unknown if input had these specials pre-placed or if filling should expand them—differs from expectation of fuller special propagation if chain allows (e.g., if 4 adjacent to 2, why not fill more 4's?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **all** train input-output pairs (and generally present in test inputs, though tests lack outputs for verification). These are limited to elements that directly interact or affect each other spatially, by color, by properties (e.g., holes, position, size via pixels/bbox), or by transformation (e.g., addition/extension). No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced semantics are included. Only consistent patterns across **every** train example are noted; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., unchanged background fills without direct ties to other components) are excluded. Where a transformation (e.g., addition of a component) occurs consistently but its exact rule cannot be explained from the data, it is called out as unknown.

#### 1. **Large Frames and Inner Small Squares (Containment and Centering Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Large frames (colored outlines, holes=1, large rectangular bbox, high pixels e.g., 8–24; colors: Blue in trains 1–3, Red in test 1, Maroon in test 2) and inner small squares (solid fills, holes=0, small square bbox, low pixels e.g., 1–4).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - Each large frame consistently contains exactly **one** inner small square, positioned at the **center** of the frame's bbox (e.g., for frame bbox [1,1,4,4], inner at [2,2,3,3]; for [1,1,3,3], inner at [2,2,2,2]; for [1,1,5,5], inner at [3,3,3,3]). This spatial centering is direct containment: the inner's bbox is fully nested inside the frame's inner space (the hole=1 area).
     - Property effect: The frame's hole=1 property is directly affected by the inner's presence (fills part of the enclosed space); no frame has holes>1 or multiple inners in inputs. Inner's holes=0 (solid) contrasts with frame's outline nature.
     - Consistency: Present in **every** input frame across all trains/tests; original inners remain unchanged in all outputs (no removal or alteration of existing inners).
     - Transformation: None to the inner itself in outputs; frames remain static.

#### 2. **Bottom Key Row and Overall Color Set (Reference Sequence Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Bottom key row (linear sequence of small solid squares, holes=0, 1-pixel each, fixed y-position near bottom e.g., y=18/11/25/27/28, spaced x-positions) and all inner small squares (plus added bars in outputs).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - The key row provides a fixed sequence of colors (e.g., train 1/2: Red-Green-LightBlue-Yellow-Red-Pink-DarkRed-Orange; train 3: Green-Red-LightBlue-Yellow-Pink-DarkRed; tests have similar sequences with Maroon/Orange/Green inclusions). All colors used in inner small squares (inputs) and added bars (outputs) are **consistently drawn from this exact set** (no new colors introduced beyond the key).
     - Position effect: Key positions (regular x-intervals) indirectly reference grid-like arrangements of frames (e.g., key has 6–8 items matching approximate frame counts per puzzle); no direct spatial overlap, but key colors propagate to inners/added components.
     - Property effect: Key items are always 1-pixel solids (holes=0), serving as a static reference unaffected by other elements.
     - Consistency: Key row is **identical** (positions, colors, sizes) in every input-output pair; all other colored components (inners, added bars) match key colors exactly.
     - Transformation: None; key row unchanged, but its color set consistently affects color choice in added components (see below).

#### 3. **Added Bars and Existing Inner Small Squares (Adjacency and Color Propagation Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Added bars (new in outputs only: rectangular solids, holes=0, larger pixels e.g., 2–6 than 1-pixel key items, elongated bbox e.g., width/height >1 unit) and existing inner small squares (from frames).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - Added bars are consistently positioned **adjacent to or between** existing inner small squares/large frames, either **horizontally** (same y-level, in x-gaps between frames, e.g., train 1 [11,2,13,3]; train 2 [4,2,4,2]; train 3 [6,3,8,3]) or **vertically** (same x-level, in y-gaps between frame rows, e.g., train 1 [2,5,3,7]; train 2 [6,4,6,4]; train 3 [11,12,11,16]).
     - Position effect: Bars "bridge" gaps—horizontal bars connect left/right adjacent inners/frames; vertical bars connect upper/lower inners/frames in the same column. Bbox of bars aligns with the gap size (partial or full fill, e.g., pixels scale with elongation: 2–6 for 1–3 unit spans).
     - Color propagation: Bar color is **always** the same as **one** adjacent inner small square's color (e.g., train 1 horizontal Dark Red matches nearby Dark Red inner; train 2 vertical Green matches adjacent Green inner; train 3 vertical Pink matches nearby Pink inner). Propagated from key color set (per #2).
     - Property effect: Bars have holes=0 (solid, like inners); their addition extends or mirrors inner properties (size via pixels increases for elongation, but color/holes match).
     - Consistency: Added bars appear in **every** train output (none in inputs); always adjacent to inners/frames; color always matches an adjacent inner (never a new color); no adds in isolated areas. In tests, no adds (inputs only), but gap positions exist similarly.
     - Transformation (unknown rule): Bars are added (not present in inputs), filling background gaps and reducing background holes (e.g., 16→9 in train 1; 15→9 in train 2; 12→7 in train 3). Exact trigger for addition (why some gaps get bars, others don't) and choice of which adjacent color to propagate (left/above vs. right/below) is unknown—consistent presence and propagation, but not the decision logic.

#### 4. **Added Bars/Extensions and Background (Filling and Hole Reduction Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Added bars (as above) and background (large fill, many holes e.g., 7–22, full-image bbox, high pixels e.g., 181–573; colors: Maroon in trains, Blue in tests).
   - **Interaction/Connection**:
     - Added bars are placed **within background gaps** (spaces between frames), directly affecting the background by occupying its area.
     - Property effect: Bar addition consistently reduces background pixels by exactly the bars' total pixels (e.g., train 1: -32 background pixels, +32 from bars; train 2: -6/+6; train 3: -15/+15), keeping total image pixels constant. Also reduces background holes (e.g., by merging or filling enclosed spaces; decrease of 6–9 holes per train).
     - Position effect: Bars' bbox overlaps former background areas (no overlap with frames/inners).
     - Consistency: In **every** train output, background properties (pixels, holes) change precisely in response to added bars' total size/location; no other elements affect background. Tests show similar background with holes, but no transformation.
     - Transformation: Background is passively affected (filled); exact hole reduction mechanism (e.g., how one bar splits/merges holes) is unknown, but consistently tied to bar placement/pixels.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable hole count → color links; no consistent shape transformations beyond addition; frame colors do not propagate to bars/inners; test variations like frame color changes do not affect core patterns). Irrelevant elements (e.g., empty grid cells without components) show no interactions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 21:19:20] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where a 2D grid represents a visual scene with background cells (typically 8), wall/prototype cells (1), and partial colored regions (numbers 2-9). The goal is to propagate and fill background cells with colors based on uniformity in rows/columns, adjacency rules from a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row, and rules for filling gaps between vertically separated "sections" of the grid defined by partial wall rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg, usually 8) cells must only be filled if they can be unambiguously propagated from adjacent uniform colored segments; never overwrite existing colors, walls (proto=1), or other non-bg cells.
 * The "chain" is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, used to determine if two colors are "adjacent" (i.e., appear next to each other in the chain, in either order) for gap-filling; if so, the preceding color in the chain can fill gaps between matching segments.
 * Sections are contiguous groups of rows (up to n-2) that contain at least one proto=1 but are not entirely proto=1; these define bounded areas for vertical propagation.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, identify segments between proto walls; if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, for adjacent segments, if their colors are adjacent in the chain, fill bg gaps between them with the preceding color from the chain pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section and per column, fill bg cells in stretches between proto walls using the single uniform color in that stretch if present.
 * Inter-section filling: Between consecutive sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-proto/bg row in each section), extract uniform colored regions from those rows, find overlapping column ranges between upper and lower regions, and if the colors are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rows (between sections) in those columns with the preceding chain color—but only if both sections have valid inner rows.
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency checks must consider order (preceding color matters, not just presence); sections exclude the last two rows (n-1 and n-2 are reserved for chain/bottom); bg detection counts non-proto in upper rows (0 to n-3) to find the most common non-proto as bg; do not fill if segments have multiple colors; gap filling between sections only applies to bg cells and only in overlapping columns; empty sections or no inner row skips filling; chain may have duplicates or gaps, but adjacency is pairwise consecutive only.
 * Edge cases: All-proto rows end sections; no sections means no vertical/inter-section filling; chain may be empty (no gap filling); varying grid widths (m) and heights (n); test inputs may have larger/more complex sections; bottom two rows (including chain row) are never modified; proto=1 is fixed and blocks propagation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Horizontal filling often works for intra-row uniformity but fails on chain-based gap filling if is_adjacent_preceding returns wrong preceding color; vertical propagation misses if sections are misidentified (e.g., including all-proto rows); inter-section filling fails if inner rows are not correctly selected (e.g., picking a row with no non-bg cells) or if overlap detection ignores partial overlaps; bg detection assumes upper rows, but if grid is small (n<3), chain/extractions return empty; no handling for multiple chains or non-standard proto/bg; fillings can cascade (horizontal then vertical then inter-section), so order matters.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it implements a full pipeline (bg detection, chain extraction, horizontal/vertical filling, section-based inter-filling) showing partial understanding of propagation rules.
 * Horizontal filling works correctly for uniform segments in rows (e.g., fills 1-regions around 2/5/7 in ex1 rows 2-3) but fails chain-based gaps (e.g., doesn't fill between 7 and 1 in ex1 row1 correctly, leaving extra 1's unfilled? Wait, actually overfills some 7's into bg areas).
 * Vertical propagation succeeds in sections for uniform columns (e.g., fills 5's vertically in ex1) but misses if sections are wrong (e.g., in ex3, doesn't fill lower vertical stacks like 6's in rows 13-17).
 * Section finding is mostly correct (identifies partial-wall groups) but excludes last two rows properly; however, inter-section gap filling fails entirely—e.g., in ex1, gaps between sections (rows 5-7) remain all bg instead of filling 2's and 6's based on chain adjacency from upper/lower inners; similarly, row12 gap unfilled for 9's/2's.
 * In ex2, horizontal fills some (e.g., 2/5/7 in row2) but misses vertical in sections and all inter-section (row4 remains bg, expected 3/6/7); chain extraction works but not applied between sections.
 * In ex3, fills upper sections horizontally/vertically (e.g., 3/2 in rows1-4) but misses many lower fillings (e.g., rows7-12 partial, rows13-17 all bg instead of 6's, rows18-22 unfilled 1-regions); inter-section skips due to no inner or overlap issues.
 * Bg detection works (identifies 8 correctly); chain extraction is accurate but underused (adjacency only for horizontal, not fully for vertical/gaps).
 * Overall, intra-section filling (horizontal/vertical) partially succeeds (~50% in ex1/3), but inter-section logic broken (no gap fills observed); no overfilling of proto or bottom rows, but underfilling dominates.
 * Function `get_inner` is helpful but fragile (returns first non-proto/bg row, but if none, skips—happens in ex1 row12?); `get_filled_regions` good for extracting uniform segments but only used post-horizontal, so misses if horizontal incomplete.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `horizontal_fill` has redundant comps building (could fill in one pass); entire inter-section loop assumes consecutive sections only and max/min overlap, but doesn't handle non-overlapping or multi-region overlaps well (e.g., ex3 complex widths).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows large uniform blocks filled (e.g., rows1-5 all 4's in cols1-5, 8's in cols8-12, 9's in cols20-24; rows8-12 6's/7's/4's; rows15-19 9's/4's/5's/3's; rows21-25 7's), with horizontal propagation seeming applied but vertical/inter-section incomplete (e.g., rows6-7 and13-14 all 1's suggest no gap filling between sections; bottom row28 has scattered colors but row27 all 1's unfilled).
 * It matches a pattern of filling wide uniform regions but leaves potential section gaps as 1's (which may be proto, but expected likely fills bg=1? Wait, test uses 1 as bg/proto? Confusion: test grid has 1 as bg/proto, differing from training's 8/1—program hardcodes proto=1, detects bg=1? But output fills over 1's incorrectly, e.g., row1 all 1's unfilled but should propagate if sections present.
 * Differences: Overfills entire blocks without wall respect (e.g., rows1-5 ignore potential proto in input); misses vertical uniformity (e.g., col1 all 1's/4's/6's/9's but not propagated down sections); chain-based gaps not filled (e.g., between row5-6 and row12-13, remains 1's); bottom row28 has 4/8/9/... but no propagation to row27; overall, looks like horizontal-only filling on assumed input sections, ignoring inter-section rules—does not match expected full propagation seen in training diffs.

[2025-09-30 21:19:20] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1). The filling propagates colors from the chain into background areas, but only where components are adjacent in the chain and connect properly through the grid's outlined shapes, without overfilling or ignoring vertical extensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is consistently the dominant filler (e.g., 8 in training examples 1 and 2, 1 in example 3 and test), identified from the bottom-left of the last row; all empty spaces start as bg.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row (n-2), filtering non-bg cells to form a sequence of colors that serves as a key for filling; positions in the chain matter for adjacency (e.g., colors at positions differing by 1 are adjacent).
 * "Proto" is the outline color (e.g., 1), found in rows above the chain by identifying rows with exactly one non-bg color; this acts as a boundary or connector, and fillings should not overwrite proto but can bridge through gaps in proto-outlined regions.
 * Components in each row (i < n-2) are contiguous non-bg segments; for each row, identify sub-components (groups of same-color cells), excluding bg and proto, and assign a primary color (proto if no other, or the dominant non-proto/bg color).
 * Filling occurs only between adjacent components in the same row if their colors are adjacent in the chain (checked via position proximity in chain, e.g., any pair of positions abs(diff)==1); gaps are filled with the chain's color at the minimal position of the adjacent pair.
 * Subtlety: Filling is horizontal within rows but must account for vertical propagation or extension from the chain upwards, especially into all-bg areas directly above chain positions (e.g., creating vertical blobs like 2x3 in train1 rows 6-7); the current program only fills horizontally and skips proto-adjacent cases, missing these verticals.
 * Do not fill if either component involves proto (current skip condition is too broad: "if comps[k][2] == proto or comps[k + 1][2] == proto: continue"), which prevents necessary bridging.
 * Chain adjacency check uses all positions of a color (pos1 + pos2), finding min_p for fill color, but fails if colors appear multiple times non-adjacently; this works for simple cases but misses multi-occurrence logic.
 * Grids have varying widths (20 in train1/2, 27 in train3, 29 in test); ensure m = len(grid[0]) handles this.
 * Outlined shapes (e.g., 1's forming boundaries around inner colors like 2,3,4) suggest enclosed regions that should be filled consistently with chain colors, but only where connected vertically/horizontally without crossing outlines.
 * Last two rows are fixed (chain in n-2, bg in n-1); processing only affects rows 0 to n-3.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical stacking of fillings (e.g., expected train1 has 3-row vertical 2's and 6's in rows 6-8, but generated has none); program doesn't propagate upwards iteratively.
 * No diagonal connections; only orthogonal (horizontal in row, vertical implied by chain position).
 * Colors 2-9 are fillers; 1/8 often bg or proto, but bg varies per grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    return [grid[n-2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n-2][j] != bg]

# Helpful inline snippet: Find proto (outline color)
def find_proto(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> int:
    for row in grid[:-2]:
        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:
    non_bg_pos = [j for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] != bg]
    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where regions bounded by prototype walls (1) and background (typically 8) are filled with colors (2-9) by propagating single-color dominance within segments, vertically within wall-defined sections, and horizontally/vertically across section gaps if colors are adjacent in a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row; the goal is to complete the grid without overfilling or misapplying rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows (0 to n-3), but only if present; empty grids return unchanged.
 * Chain extraction takes the second-last row (n-2), filtering out bg and proto to get a sequence of colors that defines "adjacency" for filling (e.g., if a and b are neighbors in chain, the preceding color can fill gaps between regions of a and b).
 * Horizontal filling occurs in every upper row (0 to n-3): between proto walls, if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, between adjacent filled segments with colors a and b, if they are adjacent in chain, fill the proto/bg gap with the preceding color from the adjacency.
 * Sections are contiguous blocks of rows (from 0 to n-3) that contain some (but not all) proto cells; these define vertical propagation zones.
 * Vertical propagation within a section: for each column, between proto cells, if the non-bg/non-proto cells in the vertical segment have exactly one color, fill bg cells in that segment with it.
 * Inter-section filling: between consecutive sections, for gap rows, if inner rows of sections have horizontally overlapping filled regions with colors a and b that are adjacent in chain, fill the entire overlapping vertical/horizontal gap area with the preceding color—but only if regions overlap horizontally (max start <= min end +1).
 * Subtlety: get_inner picks the first non-bg/non-proto row in a section as representative for region extraction; this assumes sections have consistent inner structure but can miss if sections have varying filled rows.
 * Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the preceding color (first in the pair), and same colors return themselves; no filling if no adjacency.
 * Proto (1) acts as walls/barriers; bg is never propagated as a color.
 * Edge cases: empty segments, all-proto rows (skipped), no chain (no inter-fills), sections touching (no gap), or non-overlapping regions (no cross-fill).
 * The bottom two rows (n-2 and n-1) are typically the chain and a fixed bottom bar; they are not processed for filling.
 * Overfilling risk: horizontal fill runs before sections, so it can create filled regions used in vertical/inter steps; but vertical only within sections, not across.
 * Assumption: grids are rectangular, colors 1-9, bg dominant in empties.

```
(Performs horizontal segment filling and gap filling within a row; key for initial color spread.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture: horizontal and vertical propagation work partially, but inter-section gap filling and section detection miss cases.
 * Train 1: Generated filled upper sections correctly (e.g., 1-2-5-7 blocks in rows 1-4), but failed to fill gap between sections 0-4 and 8-11 (expected 2 in cols 2-3 rows 5-7, 6 in cols 15-16 rows 5-7; generated all 8s); also overfilled row 12 with 9s in cols 8-9 (expected 8s), and misplaced 9s in row 12; bottom chain row 18 has correct sequence but no propagation upward.
 * Train 1: get_inner selected row 8 for second section, but expected fillings suggest propagation from row 9-11; horizontal_fill didn't bridge non-adjacent chain pairs (e.g., 2 and 6 not adjacent in chain [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]).
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled some bg with 1 or 2 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 4=2 but expected 8; row 4 cols 6=3 but expected 8 in a proto-heavy area); missed vertical propagation in section 4-7 (expected isolated 3,6,7 in row 4 cols 6,10,14 but generated 8s); sections misdetected, leading to no gap fill between upper and lower blocks.
 * Train 2: Chain likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] from row 11, but is_adjacent_preceding not applied correctly for cross-section (e.g., no fill for 3-6-7 isolation); horizontal_fill filled some segments but skipped gaps due to multi-color or non-adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated upper sections (rows 1-5 all filled similarly, but expected varied with 8s in some proto areas); missed vertical fills in lower sections (e.g., rows 13-17 expected 6 in col 11, but generated 8s; rows 17-21 expected isolated 8s but filled with 1s erroneously); inter-section gap (rows 6-7 and 12) not filled (expected 9 in row 6 col 19, 6 in rows 13-17 col 11).
 * Train 3: Larger grid (27 cols) exposed section detection bug—find_sections skipped some partial-proto rows (e.g., row 20 has partial but treated as full bg); vertical_propagate_within overfilled 1s into bg areas; chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] not used for gaps between multi-section blocks.
 * Overall: horizontal_fill works for single-color segments but fails gap fills if chain order wrong or segments not adjacent; vertical_propagate_within skips multi-color verticals correctly but doesn't handle section edges; inter-section logic in program() buggy—get_filled_regions uses inner row only, missing if inner has no fills yet, and overlap check (max(st1,st2) <= min(en1,en2)+1) too strict, preventing non-exact overlaps; no iteration (fills don't propagate after initial horizontal).
 * Function vertical_propagate_within is helpful but limited to sections—extend to full columns? But no, rules confine to sections.
 * Function get_filled_regions is similar to horizontal_fill logic but extracts only—useful but redundant if run after fills.
 * Function get_inner assumes first non-empty row, but if sections have bg-only inners initially, returns None and skips fills (bug in trains).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows uniform block fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4s in cols 1-5, 8s in 8-12; rows 8-13 6s/7s/4s) suggesting horizontal_fill worked for large segments, but vertical propagation seems absent or incomplete (e.g., no blending between row blocks 6-7 and 8-14, which should be sections separated by all-1 rows); inter-section gaps (rows 7,14,21) remain all 1s (proto?), but expected would fill based on chain adjacency if blocks like 4-8-9 adjacent.
 * Test output over-relies on horizontal: entire rows filled uniformly without vertical consistency (e.g., row 15-20 has 9-4-5-3 blocks, but no upward propagation from chain row 27 [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] into gaps); chain includes 1s (proto?), which shouldn't be in chain—extract_chain filters them, but output suggests misdetection (bg=1? but 1 is proto, detect_bg skips proto so bg likely another).
 * Test output misses subtle overlaps: e.g., if sections at rows 0-6 (4/8/9) and 8-13 (6/7/4), gap row 7 should fill where 4 and 6 adjacent in chain (preceding color), but remains 1s; similarly, lower sections not bridged (e.g., 9 and 4 in rows 15-20 and 22-26 should fill row 21 if adjacent).
 * Bg detection likely wrong—upper rows have 1s (proto) and some colors, but if 1 dominates non-proto count? No, detect_bg counts non-proto, so bg= some color like 1? Wait, proto=1 skipped, so bg= most common other (but output fills with colors, not bg); output has 1s as walls but fills bg-spots with colors correctly in blocks, but no gap fills, suggesting inter-section logic broken for large grids (29 cols).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for intra-section fills but ignores chain-based bridging, leaving gaps unfilled—does not match expected full completion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where numbers represent colors or barriers: 1 acts as walls/barriers (proto), 8 is typically background (bg), other numbers (2-9) are specific colors to propagate and fill into bg areas. The goal is to fill bg cells with appropriate colors based on connected uniform regions, vertical/horizontal propagation within wall-bounded sections, and gap-filling between sections using adjacency rules derived from a "chain" (likely a key sequence) extracted from near the bottom of the grid, ensuring shapes and separations match implied puzzle logic like nonograms or region-filling with constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into segments/regions both horizontally (within rows) and vertically (across rows); sections are defined as consecutive rows that contain some 1's but are not entirely 1's, and propagation must respect these boundaries without crossing full-1 rows or unrelated areas.
 * Background (bg, usually 8) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows; it must be filled only where a uniform color can be inferred from adjacent non-bg/non-proto cells, but never overwrite existing colors or 1's.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row, capturing non-bg/non-proto cells as a sequence of colors (e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in train1); this acts as an adjacency key—fills between regions use a color from the chain only if two adjacent regions' colors (a and b) appear next to each other in the chain, preferring the "preceding" one in the pair.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, segments between 1's (or edges) should be filled with a single color if all non-bg/non-proto cells in that segment share one color; bg cells in the segment get that color, but gaps between filled segments (still bg) get filled via chain if the bounding segments' colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a detected section (consecutive partial-1 rows), fill vertically column-by-column: if a vertical segment between 1's has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, propagate that color to all bg cells in that vertical run; do not cross 1's or section boundaries.
 * Gap filling between sections: For gaps (all-8 or partial rows) between two sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section), get their horizontal filled regions, and for overlapping column ranges between upper/lower regions with colors a/b, if a and b are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rectangle (overlapping columns, all gap rows) with the preceding color from the chain pair; only fill bg or 1's in those positions (but 1's might be subtle—avoid overwriting true walls?).
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency is bidirectional but returns the "preceding" color in the pair (e.g., if chain has ...a,b..., fill with a; if ...b,a..., fill with b); sections must exclude the last two rows (header/footer?); inner row selection picks the first row in a section with any non-1/bg, but if none, skip; do not fill if segment colors aren't uniform (len(seg_colors)==1); gaps only if gap_start <= gap_end; vertical propagation skips 1's but fills around them if uniform; chain extraction ignores bg and 1's but preserves order; in multi-row uniform blocks, ensure consistency across rows; bottom row (and possibly second-bottom) is the key and should remain unchanged; full-8 rows separate sections but aren't sections themselves; overlapping regions in gap-fill use max/min columns for projection.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal fill must happen before vertical/section detection (as in code), but gap-fill after; chain might have duplicates (e.g., two 2's in train1), so adjacency checks all pairs; if no uniform color, leave as bg; vertical fill only within section bounds, not across gaps; in train3, large sections need multi-row consistency; test grid has wider layout with more colors (3-9), so chain likely longer; do not fill the very top/bottom rows unless they fit section rules; bg detection scans only upper rows (n-2) to avoid key contamination.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding but incomplete implementation of propagation and gap-filling rules.
 * Horizontal filling worked partially: In train1, upper sections (rows 1-4) correctly filled uniform 1/2/5/7 segments between 1's, but failed to fill intra-row gaps between segments (e.g., row1 generated 1's but left 7/8 areas as 8's instead of using chain); similar in train2 (filled some 1/2/3/5/7 but left row1's 2-block incomplete) and train3 (filled multi-row 1/3/2/9 blocks but missed vertical consistency in lower sections).
 * Vertical propagation worked somewhat: In train1, it extended colors within sections (e.g., 2's and 5's in rows 2-3), but skipped or failed in wider blocks; in train2, filled rows5-7 correctly for 1/4/6/9 but not row4 gaps; in train3, extended upper 1/3/2 blocks across rows1-5 but left lower sections (rows8-11) with incomplete 4/6 fills (e.g., row9 has 6 but not propagated fully).
 * Section detection worked basically: Correctly identified partial-1 row groups (e.g., train1 sections at rows0-4 and 8-11; train2 at 0-2 and 5-7; train3 at 0-5 and 8-11 and 17-21), excluding full-8 and last two rows, but <n-2 limit missed some lower sections in train3 (e.g., rows17-21 detected but propagation incomplete).
 * Gap filling failed entirely: No fills in inter-section gaps; e.g., train1 generated all-8 rows5-7 where expected has 2/6 blocks (projected from upper/lower), and row12 all-8 vs expected 9/2; train2 row4 all-8 vs expected 3/6/7 blocks; train3 row6-7 and row12-16 all-8 vs expected 9/6 blocks—likely because get_inner returned valid rows but overlap checks (o_l > o_r) or chain adjacency failed (e.g., wrong preceding color or no match); also, perform_gap_fills skipped if no inner or gap too small.
 * Chain extraction worked: For train1, likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] matching bottom; used in horizontal but not effectively in gaps (e.g., 2 and 6 should fill with preceding if adjacent in chain, but didn't).
 * Bg detection worked: 8 correctly identified in all.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: perform_gap_fills is broken (no fills occur, possibly due to strict overlap or fill_c None; overwrites proto=1 in gaps? but shouldn't); get_filled_regions misses non-uniform post-fill; vertical_propagate_within skips too aggressively (leaves bg in multi-color verticals, but examples need uniform check); overall program modifies grid_out in-place but doesn't handle multi-section gaps or chain duplicates well; no function for full-grid uniformity check post-fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete propagation and missing gap fills similar to training failures; e.g., rows1-6 have 4's and 8's filled horizontally but no vertical extension to row6's partial 9's, and row7-8 all 1's (possibly misbg?) where gaps should project colors like 9's from above; rows8-12 fill 6/7/4 but row13 cuts 4's short (ends with 1's instead of full block), suggesting horizontal_fill failed end-segment; row15 has 9/5/3 blocks but row16 all 1's (gap unfilled, should project from row15 to row20's 3/7?); rows21-25 fill 3 then 7's but inconsistently (row21 3's full, rows22-26 7's but row26 all 1's?); bottom key row27 has 4/8/9/etc. unchanged (good), but overall lacks vertical consistency in lower half (e.g., 5/3/7 blocks not propagated up from key projections) and gap rectangles (e.g., between row12 and row14, no 4/5/3 fills); compared to training patterns, it over-relies on horizontal (matches upper 4/8/9 shapes) but misses chain-based gap/vertical for lower (e.g., expected likely has 7's extending up from row22 into row16 gap, using chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 5-7); without expected, it differs by leaving too many 1's/bg in gaps/verticals, making shapes incomplete (e.g., 4-block in row13-14 not uniform height).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where a 2D grid represents a visual scene with background cells (typically 8), wall/prototype cells (1), and partial colored regions (numbers 2-9). The goal is to propagate and fill background cells with colors based on uniformity in rows/columns, adjacency rules from a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row, and rules for filling gaps between vertically separated "sections" of the grid defined by partial wall rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg, usually 8) cells must only be filled if they can be unambiguously propagated from adjacent uniform colored segments; never overwrite existing colors, walls (proto=1), or other non-bg cells.
 * The "chain" is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, used to determine if two colors are "adjacent" (i.e., appear next to each other in the chain, in either order) for gap-filling; if so, the preceding color in the chain can fill gaps between matching segments.
 * Sections are contiguous groups of rows (up to n-2) that contain at least one proto=1 but are not entirely proto=1; these define bounded areas for vertical propagation.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, identify segments between proto walls; if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, for adjacent segments, if their colors are adjacent in the chain, fill bg gaps between them with the preceding color from the chain pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section and per column, fill bg cells in stretches between proto walls using the single uniform color in that stretch if present.
 * Inter-section filling: Between consecutive sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-proto/bg row in each section), extract uniform colored regions from those rows, find overlapping column ranges between upper and lower regions, and if the colors are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rows (between sections) in those columns with the preceding chain color—but only if both sections have valid inner rows.
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency checks must consider order (preceding color matters, not just presence); sections exclude the last two rows (n-1 and n-2 are reserved for chain/bottom); bg detection counts non-proto in upper rows (0 to n-3) to find the most common non-proto as bg; do not fill if segments have multiple colors; gap filling between sections only applies to bg cells and only in overlapping columns; empty sections or no inner row skips filling; chain may have duplicates or gaps, but adjacency is pairwise consecutive only.
 * Edge cases: All-proto rows end sections; no sections means no vertical/inter-section filling; chain may be empty (no gap filling); varying grid widths (m) and heights (n); test inputs may have larger/more complex sections; bottom two rows (including chain row) are never modified; proto=1 is fixed and blocks propagation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Horizontal filling often works for intra-row uniformity but fails on chain-based gap filling if is_adjacent_preceding returns wrong preceding color; vertical propagation misses if sections are misidentified (e.g., including all-proto rows); inter-section filling fails if inner rows are not correctly selected (e.g., picking a row with no non-bg cells) or if overlap detection ignores partial overlaps; bg detection assumes upper rows, but if grid is small (n<3), chain/extractions return empty; no handling for multiple chains or non-standard proto/bg; fillings can cascade (horizontal then vertical then inter-section), so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it implements a full pipeline (bg detection, chain extraction, horizontal/vertical filling, section-based inter-filling) showing partial understanding of propagation rules.
 * Horizontal filling works correctly for uniform segments in rows (e.g., fills 1-regions around 2/5/7 in ex1 rows 2-3) but fails chain-based gaps (e.g., doesn't fill between 7 and 1 in ex1 row1 correctly, leaving extra 1's unfilled? Wait, actually overfills some 7's into bg areas).
 * Vertical propagation succeeds in sections for uniform columns (e.g., fills 5's vertically in ex1) but misses if sections are wrong (e.g., in ex3, doesn't fill lower vertical stacks like 6's in rows 13-17).
 * Section finding is mostly correct (identifies partial-wall groups) but excludes last two rows properly; however, inter-section gap filling fails entirely—e.g., in ex1, gaps between sections (rows 5-7) remain all bg instead of filling 2's and 6's based on chain adjacency from upper/lower inners; similarly, row12 gap unfilled for 9's/2's.
 * In ex2, horizontal fills some (e.g., 2/5/7 in row2) but misses vertical in sections and all inter-section (row4 remains bg, expected 3/6/7); chain extraction works but not applied between sections.
 * In ex3, fills upper sections horizontally/vertically (e.g., 3/2 in rows1-4) but misses many lower fillings (e.g., rows7-12 partial, rows13-17 all bg instead of 6's, rows18-22 unfilled 1-regions); inter-section skips due to no inner or overlap issues.
 * Bg detection works (identifies 8 correctly); chain extraction is accurate but underused (adjacency only for horizontal, not fully for vertical/gaps).
 * Overall, intra-section filling (horizontal/vertical) partially succeeds (~50% in ex1/3), but inter-section logic broken (no gap fills observed); no overfilling of proto or bottom rows, but underfilling dominates.
 * Function `get_inner` is helpful but fragile (returns first non-proto/bg row, but if none, skips—happens in ex1 row12?); `get_filled_regions` good for extracting uniform segments but only used post-horizontal, so misses if horizontal incomplete.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `horizontal_fill` has redundant comps building (could fill in one pass); entire inter-section loop assumes consecutive sections only and max/min overlap, but doesn't handle non-overlapping or multi-region overlaps well (e.g., ex3 complex widths).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows large uniform blocks filled (e.g., rows1-5 all 4's in cols1-5, 8's in cols8-12, 9's in cols20-24; rows8-12 6's/7's/4's; rows15-19 9's/4's/5's/3's; rows21-25 7's), with horizontal propagation seeming applied but vertical/inter-section incomplete (e.g., rows6-7 and13-14 all 1's suggest no gap filling between sections; bottom row28 has scattered colors but row27 all 1's unfilled).
 * It matches a pattern of filling wide uniform regions but leaves potential section gaps as 1's (which may be proto, but expected likely fills bg=1? Wait, test uses 1 as bg/proto? Confusion: test grid has 1 as bg/proto, differing from training's 8/1—program hardcodes proto=1, detects bg=1? But output fills over 1's incorrectly, e.g., row1 all 1's unfilled but should propagate if sections present.
 * Differences: Overfills entire blocks without wall respect (e.g., rows1-5 ignore potential proto in input); misses vertical uniformity (e.g., col1 all 1's/4's/6's/9's but not propagated down sections); chain-based gaps not filled (e.g., between row5-6 and row12-13, remains 1's); bottom row28 has 4/8/9/... but no propagation to row27; overall, looks like horizontal-only filling on assumed input sections, ignoring inter-section rules—does not match expected full propagation seen in training diffs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where background areas (bg) are filled with colors based on propagation rules within and between sections delimited by prototype walls (value 1), using horizontal filling of uniform segments, vertical propagation inside sections, and inter-section filling guided by overlapping colored regions and an adjacency chain extracted from near the bottom of the grid. The chain represents a sequence of colors that determines allowable fills between adjacent but separated colors (a and b can be bridged by a preceding color in the chain if they appear adjacent in it).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (1) acts as walls/barriers that segment the grid into sections; sections are identified by consecutive rows that contain some but not all 1s (mixed proto and non-proto).
 * Background (bg, often 0 or unfilled) is filled only if a segment/region has exactly one non-bg, non-proto color; multi-color segments are not filled.
 * Horizontal filling occurs first across all non-bottom rows, unifying bg in uniform-color gaps between 1s and bridging gaps between adjacent uniform segments if their colors are "adjacent" in the chain (i.e., appear next to each other in chain, filling with the preceding one).
 * Vertical propagation happens only within each section (between section start/end), filling bg in columns if the vertical segment in that column has exactly one color; it expands to cover the min-max range of that color's positions but skips over 1s.
 * Inter-section filling targets gaps between consecutive sections (rows from upper section end+1 to lower start-1), but only in columns where upper and lower "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section) have overlapping uniform colored regions; fill uses chain adjacency, and only bg is overwritten.
 * Chain extraction is from the second-to-last row (n-2), collecting non-bg, non-proto values in order, skipping 1s— this row often contains the "key" sequence of isolated colors separated by 1s.
 * Adjacency check in chain is symmetric (a then b or b then a) but returns the preceding color for filling; if a==b, use a directly.
 * Bottom two rows (n-1 and possibly n-2) are treated specially: n-1 is all 1s or bg, n-2 provides chain; no filling applied to bottom rows.
 * Subtle: "Inner" row for a section is the first row within it that has any non-1, non-bg; if none, skip inter-fill for that section pair.
 * Subtle: Overlap for inter-fill is strict (max start to min end of regions); no fill if no overlap or no chain link.
 * Edge cases: Empty sections, single-row sections, full-proto rows (not sections), grids with n<2 (return as-is), or chain with duplicates/self-adjacencies.
 * No overwriting of existing non-bg colors; only bg is filled. Sections must have mixed rows (some 1s but not all) to qualify—pure non-proto rows aren't sections for vertical prop.
 * Propagation doesn't cross sections vertically or use chain for intra-section fills; chain is only for horizontal bridges and inter-section gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(This extracts the color sequence from the penultimate row, ignoring bg and proto—essential for determining fill colors between adjacent regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(This checks chain for adjacency and returns the bridging color—core for all fill decisions; handles self-match directly.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    n = len(grid)
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as consecutive rows up to n-2 with partial proto coverage—key for scoping vertical and inter-fills; excludes bottom rows.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    # (as provided in attempt; fills uniform segments between protos with their single color, and bridges gaps between adjacent segments using chain)
```
(Helpful for initial horizontal unification across all rows.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    # (as provided; fills vertical bg segments within a section/column if single color present, expanding to min-max of that color)
```
(Helpful for intra-section vertical filling, but note it skips protos and only acts on bg.)

```python
def get_inner(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # (as provided; finds first row in section with any non-proto non-bg for inter-section reference)
```
(Helpful for selecting representative rows for overlap in inter-fills.)

```python
def get_filled_regions(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # (as provided; extracts uniform single-color segments between protos in a row, ignoring bg)
```
(Helpful for identifying regions in inner rows for overlap checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, indicating solid implementation of horizontal filling, section detection, vertical propagation within sections, and basic inter-section filling via chain.
 * What worked: Chain extraction accurately pulls the key sequence; horizontal_fill unifies bg in uniform gaps and bridges via chain adjacency; vertical_propagate_within properly scopes to sections and fills single-color verticals without crossing walls; section finding skips bottom rows and pure rows correctly.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, large areas are over-filled with 2 (likely from chain having many 2s or self-adjacency), but isolated higher numbers (e.g., 4,8,9 in rows 3,10,17) are preserved as "seeds" without surrounding fills, suggesting incomplete propagation around them—expected more bridging if chain allows (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 4 in chain, gaps near 4 should fill with preceding color, but appear as bg or unfilled in output? Wait, output shows 2s around them, but perhaps not vertically between sections).
 * Missed potential: Inter-section filling seems limited; in test output, the lower section (rows ~20-25) has 2s only on the right, with left all 1s, but if overlaps exist with upper sections' inner rows (which have scattered 4,8,etc.), more fills expected in gaps (rows 11-16? appear all 2s, but row 17 has mixed—perhaps sections misidentified).
 * extract_chain is essential and correct (pulls from n-2, which in test output became [1,4,1,8,...] after fills? No, chain extracted before fills, so from input's n-2).
 * horizontal_fill is helpful but may over-apply bridges if chain has long 2-2 sequences, leading to uniform 2 floods.
 * vertical_propagate_within is mostly correct but in test, columns with mixed seeds (e.g., col 3 has 4 in row3, 6 in row10, 9 in row17) aren't unified vertically across sections, which is intended (only within), but gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) remain 2-filled horizontally, potentially correct if no overlap trigger.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are essential for inter-fills but may fail if inner row is all bg after horizontal (test output has inner rows with seeds like row3, so okay); however, overlaps might be too narrow, missing wider fills.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though find_sections excludes i >= n-2 strictly, which is good but subtle if input has proto in bottom.

**Test output:**
 * The test output fills most of the grid with 2s in large horizontal bands (e.g., rows 1-2,4-9,11-16,18-20,22-23,25-26), preserving isolated higher colors (4,8,9 in row3; 6,7,4 in row10; 9,4,2,5,3 in row17; 7 in row23) surrounded by 2s or 1s, which makes sense if 2 is a dominant chain color and seeds are non-propagated starts.
 * It looks partially correct: Bottom row all 1s (untouched), second-last all 1s (perhaps input was mixed, but filled to proto? No, code doesn't fill bottom), chain row (row 27 in output) has isolated 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7 separated by 1s, matching expected chain preservation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 20-25) has 2s only in columns 20-24, with left side all 1s—no vertical propagation or inter-fill into left bg areas, suggesting missed overlaps with upper mixed rows (e.g., row17 has colors up to col23, should overlap and fill gaps above row20 if chain links, but remains 1/bg? Output shows 1s, implying no fill triggered—perhaps get_inner picks a row without left colors).
 * Gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) are fully 2-filled horizontally, which seems correct if upper/lower inners overlap in cols 3,10,22 (where seeds are) and chain has 2-4/2-8 etc., but vertically in those columns, bg above/below seeds isn't filled (e.g., col3 row4=2, but if vertical prop within section, why not extend from seed? Sections may not include seed rows if they are full-mixed).
 * Row 0 and row 28 all 1s (top/bottom borders, correct untouched). Row 21 all 1s? Wait, output row20 is mixed 1s and 2s on right—looks like partial section. Overall, over-reliance on 2 suggests chain starts/bridges with 2, but scattered seeds in row17 (cols 3,9,11,15-16,18,22) aren't bridged horizontally in that row (gaps are 2s, but if multi-color, no fill—correct, but expected more inter-fill below).
 * The output makes sense for a 2-dominant fill but misses potential fills in left-lower areas and between scattered seeds, differing from expectation of fuller propagation if sections/overlaps are broader; unknown if input had more bg in lower left, but output leaves it as 1s (proto? or bg not filled—code sets bg to colors, but if input 1s, untouched).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a walled structure (using 1 as proto/walls) with background (likely 0) and colored regions (numbers like 2,3,4,...), where the goal is to fill empty background areas horizontally and vertically based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a key row near the bottom of the grid. The filling propagates colors between wall-separated regions only if the bordering colors are adjacent in the chain sequence, using the preceding or matching color from the chain to decide the fill color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is identified from the last row's first cell, assumed to be 0 or empty; all fills target only bg cells without overwriting existing colors or walls.
 * The chain is a sequence of non-bg colors extracted from the second-to-last row (grid[n-2]), representing an ordering of colors that defines valid adjacencies for filling (e.g., colors must appear consecutively in the chain to allow propagation between regions).
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into sections both vertically (stacks of wall rows) and horizontally (within rows); sections are contiguous blocks of rows with at least one proto in them.
 * Vertical filling occurs between non-adjacent vertical sections (with gap rows in between) by identifying "inner" rows in each section (first non-pure-proto/bg row), extracting uniform-color regions in those inners, and filling overlapping horizontal spans in the gap rows with a color from the chain if the bordering region colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling happens within individual rows, between consecutive walls, filling bg in uniform-color regions if bordering colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Subtlety: Regions must be uniform single-color (no mixed colors within a wall-bounded segment) to be considered for filling; scattered same-color cells in a segment don't qualify unless contiguous (code uses min/max j of js, but assumes uniformity).
 * Adjacency in chain is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color based on order (if a then b, return a; if b then a, return b), which might imply directionality in propagation (e.g., fill with the earlier-in-chain color).
 * Easy to miss: Vertical sections skip the last two rows (while i < n-2), assuming the chain and bg rows are at the bottom and not part of sections; inner rows are chosen as the first row in a section with non-proto/bg content.
 * Gaps between sections must have no overlap in filling logic; if sections are adjacent (end1 +1 >= start2), no vertical fill.
 * Chain extraction ignores bg and proto, but assumes the row has meaningful sequence; if chain <2 elements, no filling.
 * Overwriting only bg; existing colors (like special numbers 3-9) stay, so fills don't propagate over pre-placed colors.
 * Grid dimensions: Assumes rectangular (n rows, m cols); early returns if n<3.
 * Potential edge case: Multiple regions per inner row; filling only where horizontal overlaps exist between upper/lower regions.
 * Chain may include duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's), allowing multiple adjacencies; is_adjacent_preceding checks for exact pairs in sequence, not just presence.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it successfully handled all three training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating solid core logic for basic vertical and horizontal filling between wall sections using chain adjacencies.
 * Worked well for identifying bg (0), extracting chain from second-last row, and finding vertical sections excluding bottom two rows.
 * Vertical fill correctly skips adjacent sections and only fills gaps where inner-row regions overlap horizontally and colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Horizontal fill properly identifies regions between walls in rows and fills if adjacent in chain, but only within the same row.
 * What didn't work/may be limited: get_inner_row picks only the first valid row in a section, potentially missing multi-row sections with varying inner content; if a section has no qualifying inner row (all proto/bg), skips entirely.
 * get_regions requires strictly uniform single color per inter-wall segment (set len==1), which works if regions are solid but may fail if input has pre-filled partials or mixed bg/colors; it also takes min/max of js but doesn't ensure full coverage (e.g., holes in region ignored).
 * is_adjacent_preceding is symmetric but biased toward the order in chain (returns the first in pair), which succeeded in training but might not handle reverse propagation or multi-hop chains.
 * No extraction of "objects" per se (e.g., full blobs or connected components); focuses on wall-bounded regions, which is helpful but assumes walls define all boundaries—may miss open areas without walls.
 * horizontal_fill re-extracts regions per row (redundant with get_regions) and uses index k of walls for positioning, which is functional but inefficient; it fills only between consecutive regions in the same row.
 * vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are applied sequentially (vert then horiz), which may overwrite or miss interactions if horiz creates new adjacencies for vert (but since copies grid, it's one-pass).
 * No handling for chain colors not present in regions (fills only if exact match); assumes proto=1 fixed, bg dynamic.
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of wall-section-chain rules but may underfill in complex test cases with multi-layer sections or non-uniform inners.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from lists) with heavy use of 1's as walls/borders, large areas filled with 2's (likely the dominant chain color), and isolated special colors (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) placed in specific positions across rows 3,10,17,23, matching a pattern like staggered "key" placements vertically aligned with the bottom chain row 27: [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,...].
 * It looks partially correct: Upper sections (rows 0-6,8-13) are mostly 2-filled between walls with specials like 4,8,9,6,7,4 in row 3/10, suggesting vertical propagation of 2's where adjacent to chain (assuming 2 is prevalent in chain), and specials are preserved (not overwritten).
 * Middle section (rows 15-19) has expanded 2's in central columns (14-19) with specials 9,4,5,3, indicating horizontal/vertical fills triggered by chain adjacencies (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 9/4/5/3, fill 2 in overlaps).
 * Lower sections (rows 21-25) have narrower 2-fills (columns 20-24) with 7 in row 23, showing localized filling, possibly due to narrower wall sections or no overlap with upper regions.
 * What doesn't look correct: Many areas remain as 1's or potentially unfilled (though output shows no explicit 0's, assuming bg was 0 and filled to 2's where possible); for example, rows 1-2,4-5, etc., mirror row structures but fill only 2's around specials without propagating the specials themselves upward/downward—e.g., the 4 in row 3 col 3 isn't filled vertically into row 2 col 3 (still 2?), suggesting vertical_fill didn't trigger for that pair (perhaps no chain adjacency between 4 and bordering 2, or no gap/overlap). Similarly, central expansions in rows 15-19 seem correct, but lower partial fills (only cols 20-24) differ from upper full-width 2's, possibly missing vertical propagation across full horizontal span if chain doesn't support wider overlaps. Bottom rows 26-28 are all 1's except the chain in 27, which is preserved correctly. Overall, it makes sense for a chain-heavy-2 puzzle but appears incomplete in propagating specials (e.g., no 4/8/9 fills beyond their input positions), which might be expected if the puzzle requires filling gaps with adjacent chain colors including specials; unknown if input had these specials pre-placed or if filling should expand them—differs from expectation of fuller special propagation if chain allows (e.g., if 4 adjacent to 2, why not fill more 4's?).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 21:25:13] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where regions of colored cells (numbers 2-9) are partially filled, separated by prototype walls (1's) and background (typically 8's or similar empty spaces), and the goal is to propagate and fill the background spaces with appropriate colors based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a specific row (often the second-to-last row, excluding backgrounds and prototypes). The filling follows horizontal and vertical propagation within sections bounded by prototypes, and bridging gaps between sections using chain-based color matching, ultimately producing a completed grid that matches expected patterns without overfilling or misapplying colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototypes (proto=1) act as walls or dividers that bound sections; they should not be overwritten, and filling stops at them.
 * Background (bg, often 8) is the empty space to fill; detection of bg is crucial and should be the most common non-proto color in early rows (code uses rows 0 to n-3).
 * The chain is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, which serves as a reference for "adjacent preceding" color rules—e.g., if two colors A and B are adjacent in the chain (in either order), a fill color C can bridge them if C precedes them adjacently in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling occurs within rows, filling bg gaps between proto walls if the segment has a single dominant color, and bridging adjacent segments if their colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Vertical propagation fills bg within column segments bounded by proto in a section, using the single color if present.
 * Sections are contiguous row groups (from 0 to n-3) that contain some but not all proto in a row; gaps between sections (rows with all bg or all proto?) are bridged vertically by finding overlapping horizontal regions in "inner" rows of adjacent sections and filling the gap rows with chain-derived colors where overlaps match.
 * Subtlety: "Inner" rows for bridging are the first non-proto/bg row in a section; if none, skip. Overlaps are horizontal position-based (max start to min end).
 * Chain adjacency check (is_adjacent_preceding) returns the preceding color if A and B are neighbors in chain, but only if they match exactly (order flexible); if A==B, return A. This is used for bridging but may fail if chain order matters directionally (unobserved).
 * Gaps between sections only fill where upper and lower regions overlap horizontally; non-overlapping areas stay bg.
 * Easy to miss: Full-row bg or proto rows (like rows n-1 and n-2 in some examples) are not processed for sections or chain if excluded; chain is strictly from row n-2 non-bg/proto cells.
 * Another subtlety: In vertical propagation, collect colors in a column segment excluding bg/proto, and fill only if exactly one unique color; multi-color segments don't fill.
 * Horizontal fill first applies to all rows 0 to n-3, then vertical within sections, then inter-section bridging—order matters to avoid overfilling.
 * Bg detection scans only early rows (0 to n-3), assuming later rows are chain/reserved; if grid has varying bg, this fails.
 * In examples, some expected fillings create vertical stacks (e.g., 2's and 6's in gaps) that span multiple rows, suggesting bridging applies to entire gap height.
 * Proto rows can be partial; sections end when a row is all proto or no proto.
 * Chain may have duplicates or orders that imply directionality (e.g., 2 before 3 allows filling with 2 between 3-regions? But code returns preceding, which may be wrong).
 * Test inputs may have different bg (e.g., 1 as bg?) or wider grids, requiring robust detection.
 * Unobserved: Some expected outputs leave certain bg unfilled if no chain match, or fill with specific colors from chain positions.

def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    # Fills bg in row i between proto walls if single color, and bridges adjacent single-color segments if chain-adjacent. Useful for initial row-level filling.
    # (Full implementation as in code; works partially but overfills in examples.)
```

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    # Fills bg vertically in columns within a section if single color in segment. Good for intra-section consistency, but doesn't handle multi-color.
    # (Full as in code.)
```

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `get_inner`: Attempts to find first non-bg/proto row in section for bridging reference, but in examples, it picks rows that lead to wrong overlaps (e.g., picks filled rows, causing no bridging).
- `get_filled_regions`: Extracts single-color segments between proto in a row, but when used for bridging, it fails to align upper/lower overlaps correctly, leading to no fills in gaps.
- Overall program structure: Applies horizontal fill to all rows first (good), vertical within sections (partial), but inter-section bridging is flawed—wrong inner row selection and overlap logic miss vertical stacks in gaps.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects bg=8 and extracts chain (e.g., in Train 1: [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5,...]), and applies some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., fills single-color segments like 7's in Train 1 row 2).
 * Horizontal fill works partially: In Train 1, it correctly fills some bg to match colors within segments (e.g., row 1 fills 1's), but overfills bridges incorrectly (e.g., fills 7's where expected has 8's in row 1 cols 11-13).
 * Vertical propagation works in simple cases but misses in complex sections: In Train 1, it fills some but leaves gaps unfilled vertically.
 * Section finding identifies partial-proto row groups correctly (e.g., Train 1 sections at rows 1-4 and 8-11), but bridging between sections fails entirely—no fills in gap rows 5-7 and 12-13, where expected has vertical 2's (cols 2-3) and 6's (cols 16-17) based on chain adjacency (e.g., 2 precedes 1? Chain links needed).
 * In Train 1 generated vs expected: Rows 1 differs (generated fills 7's in cols 11-13 and 1's in 14-17; expected has 8's in 11-13); rows 5-7 all 8's in generated but expected has 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17 across 3 rows; row 12 all 8's but expected has 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; row 13 differs (generated has 1's/4's/2's but expected has 1's/8's). Reason unknown but likely wrong overlap detection in bridging.
 * In Train 2 generated vs expected: Minimal filling (many 8's stay); row 1 has extra 2 in col 4 (generated) vs 8 expected; rows 4-5 all 8's but expected row 4 has 3/6/7 isolated; no bridging fills vertical gaps (e.g., expected row 4 has scattered colors, but generated leaves empty). Chain [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] not used for bridging.
 * In Train 3 generated vs expected: Fills some horizontals (e.g., row 1 3's and 2's match), but verticals overfill (e.g., rows 4-5 duplicate row 1 fills incorrectly); sections found but bridging misses (rows 6 empty, expected has 9 in col 19; rows 12-16 all 8's but expected has 6's in col 11 across 5 rows); rows 17-22 have partial 1's but expected has 8's in many places and 9/7 isolated. Overpropagation in vertical func likely.
 * extract_chain is essential and correct for adjacency rules.
 * horizontal_fill is partially helpful but bridges too aggressively without checking chain direction.
 * vertical_propagate_within is useful but skips multi-color segments correctly—issue is in section bounds.
 * find_sections works but excludes gap rows properly.
 * is_adjacent_preceding may be broken: Returns preceding (left) in chain, but expected bridges might need the common predecessor or something else (unknown why gaps like 2's in Train 1).
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are incorrect for bridging: Wrong row selection (e.g., picks bottom of section) and overlap calc misses vertical extension to full gap height.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of sections and chain but fails bridging logic, leading to empty gaps where expected has stacked colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massively with 1's (likely misdetected as bg or proto), creating solid rows of 1's (e.g., row 0 all 1's, row 26 all 1's) where expected likely has structured regions and bg preserved in non-fill areas.
 * It applies some block fills (e.g., 4's in rows 1-6 cols 1-5, 9's in rows 1-6 cols 20-24, 6's in rows 8-14 cols 1-5), which may match intra-section propagation, but chain-based bridging seems absent (e.g., row 14 has 4's but no connection to upper/lower; rows 15-16 have mixed but overfilled with 1's in non-region spots).
 * Gaps like between rows 6-7 (all 1's/9's but mismatched) and rows 20-25 (7's but bordered by 1's) suggest failed section detection or bg=1 misfill, leaving no empty spaces and ignoring chain (unseen, but likely [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] from row 27).
 * This doesn't make sense as a completed puzzle—too uniform with 1's everywhere outside blocks, unlike training expecteds that preserve bg in non-connected areas and use chain for targeted fills.

[2025-09-30 21:25:13] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1). The filling propagates colors from the chain into background areas, but only where components are adjacent in the chain and connect properly through the grid's outlined shapes, without overfilling or ignoring vertical extensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is consistently the dominant filler (e.g., 8 in training examples 1 and 2, 1 in example 3 and test), identified from the bottom-left of the last row; all empty spaces start as bg.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row (n-2), filtering non-bg cells to form a sequence of colors that serves as a key for filling; positions in the chain matter for adjacency (e.g., colors at positions differing by 1 are adjacent).
 * "Proto" is the outline color (e.g., 1), found in rows above the chain by identifying rows with exactly one non-bg color; this acts as a boundary or connector, and fillings should not overwrite proto but can bridge through gaps in proto-outlined regions.
 * Components in each row (i < n-2) are contiguous non-bg segments; for each row, identify sub-components (groups of same-color cells), excluding bg and proto, and assign a primary color (proto if no other, or the dominant non-proto/bg color).
 * Filling occurs only between adjacent components in the same row if their colors are adjacent in the chain (checked via position proximity in chain, e.g., any pair of positions abs(diff)==1); gaps are filled with the chain's color at the minimal position of the adjacent pair.
 * Subtlety: Filling is horizontal within rows but must account for vertical propagation or extension from the chain upwards, especially into all-bg areas directly above chain positions (e.g., creating vertical blobs like 2x3 in train1 rows 6-7); the current program only fills horizontally and skips proto-adjacent cases, missing these verticals.
 * Do not fill if either component involves proto (current skip condition is too broad: "if comps[k][2] == proto or comps[k + 1][2] == proto: continue"), which prevents necessary bridging.
 * Chain adjacency check uses all positions of a color (pos1 + pos2), finding min_p for fill color, but fails if colors appear multiple times non-adjacently; this works for simple cases but misses multi-occurrence logic.
 * Grids have varying widths (20 in train1/2, 27 in train3, 29 in test); ensure m = len(grid[0]) handles this.
 * Outlined shapes (e.g., 1's forming boundaries around inner colors like 2,3,4) suggest enclosed regions that should be filled consistently with chain colors, but only where connected vertically/horizontally without crossing outlines.
 * Last two rows are fixed (chain in n-2, bg in n-1); processing only affects rows 0 to n-3.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical stacking of fillings (e.g., expected train1 has 3-row vertical 2's and 6's in rows 6-8, but generated has none); program doesn't propagate upwards iteratively.
 * No diagonal connections; only orthogonal (horizontal in row, vertical implied by chain position).
 * Colors 2-9 are fillers; 1/8 often bg or proto, but bg varies per grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    return [grid[n-2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n-2][j] != bg]

# Helpful inline snippet: Find proto (outline color)
def find_proto(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> int:
    for row in grid[:-2]:
        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:
    non_bg_pos = [j for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] != bg]
    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where regions bounded by prototype walls (1) and background (typically 8) are filled with colors (2-9) by propagating single-color dominance within segments, vertically within wall-defined sections, and horizontally/vertically across section gaps if colors are adjacent in a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row; the goal is to complete the grid without overfilling or misapplying rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows (0 to n-3), but only if present; empty grids return unchanged.
 * Chain extraction takes the second-last row (n-2), filtering out bg and proto to get a sequence of colors that defines "adjacency" for filling (e.g., if a and b are neighbors in chain, the preceding color can fill gaps between regions of a and b).
 * Horizontal filling occurs in every upper row (0 to n-3): between proto walls, if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, between adjacent filled segments with colors a and b, if they are adjacent in chain, fill the proto/bg gap with the preceding color from the adjacency.
 * Sections are contiguous blocks of rows (from 0 to n-3) that contain some (but not all) proto cells; these define vertical propagation zones.
 * Vertical propagation within a section: for each column, between proto cells, if the non-bg/non-proto cells in the vertical segment have exactly one color, fill bg cells in that segment with it.
 * Inter-section filling: between consecutive sections, for gap rows, if inner rows of sections have horizontally overlapping filled regions with colors a and b that are adjacent in chain, fill the entire overlapping vertical/horizontal gap area with the preceding color—but only if regions overlap horizontally (max start <= min end +1).
 * Subtlety: get_inner picks the first non-bg/non-proto row in a section as representative for region extraction; this assumes sections have consistent inner structure but can miss if sections have varying filled rows.
 * Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the preceding color (first in the pair), and same colors return themselves; no filling if no adjacency.
 * Proto (1) acts as walls/barriers; bg is never propagated as a color.
 * Edge cases: empty segments, all-proto rows (skipped), no chain (no inter-fills), sections touching (no gap), or non-overlapping regions (no cross-fill).
 * The bottom two rows (n-2 and n-1) are typically the chain and a fixed bottom bar; they are not processed for filling.
 * Overfilling risk: horizontal fill runs before sections, so it can create filled regions used in vertical/inter steps; but vertical only within sections, not across.
 * Assumption: grids are rectangular, colors 1-9, bg dominant in empties.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def detect_bg(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> int:
    n = len(grid)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    m = len(grid[0])
    count = {}
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(m):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != proto:
                count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(Detects background as most frequent non-proto in upper rows; useful for identifying fill target.)

```python

    m = len(grid[0])
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(Extracts the adjacency chain from row n-2, excluding bg/proto; core for determining fill colors between regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(Checks if a and b are adjacent in chain and returns the preceding color; essential for gap filling, handles symmetry.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    n = len(grid)
    if n < 2:

```
(Identifies contiguous sections of rows with partial proto; useful for scoping vertical propagation.)

```
(Performs horizontal segment filling and gap filling within a row; key for initial color spread.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture: horizontal and vertical propagation work partially, but inter-section gap filling and section detection miss cases.
 * Train 1: Generated filled upper sections correctly (e.g., 1-2-5-7 blocks in rows 1-4), but failed to fill gap between sections 0-4 and 8-11 (expected 2 in cols 2-3 rows 5-7, 6 in cols 15-16 rows 5-7; generated all 8s); also overfilled row 12 with 9s in cols 8-9 (expected 8s), and misplaced 9s in row 12; bottom chain row 18 has correct sequence but no propagation upward.
 * Train 1: get_inner selected row 8 for second section, but expected fillings suggest propagation from row 9-11; horizontal_fill didn't bridge non-adjacent chain pairs (e.g., 2 and 6 not adjacent in chain [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]).
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled some bg with 1 or 2 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 4=2 but expected 8; row 4 cols 6=3 but expected 8 in a proto-heavy area); missed vertical propagation in section 4-7 (expected isolated 3,6,7 in row 4 cols 6,10,14 but generated 8s); sections misdetected, leading to no gap fill between upper and lower blocks.
 * Train 2: Chain likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] from row 11, but is_adjacent_preceding not applied correctly for cross-section (e.g., no fill for 3-6-7 isolation); horizontal_fill filled some segments but skipped gaps due to multi-color or non-adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated upper sections (rows 1-5 all filled similarly, but expected varied with 8s in some proto areas); missed vertical fills in lower sections (e.g., rows 13-17 expected 6 in col 11, but generated 8s; rows 17-21 expected isolated 8s but filled with 1s erroneously); inter-section gap (rows 6-7 and 12) not filled (expected 9 in row 6 col 19, 6 in rows 13-17 col 11).
 * Train 3: Larger grid (27 cols) exposed section detection bug—find_sections skipped some partial-proto rows (e.g., row 20 has partial but treated as full bg); vertical_propagate_within overfilled 1s into bg areas; chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] not used for gaps between multi-section blocks.
 * Overall: horizontal_fill works for single-color segments but fails gap fills if chain order wrong or segments not adjacent; vertical_propagate_within skips multi-color verticals correctly but doesn't handle section edges; inter-section logic in program() buggy—get_filled_regions uses inner row only, missing if inner has no fills yet, and overlap check (max(st1,st2) <= min(en1,en2)+1) too strict, preventing non-exact overlaps; no iteration (fills don't propagate after initial horizontal).
 * Function vertical_propagate_within is helpful but limited to sections—extend to full columns? But no, rules confine to sections.
 * Function get_filled_regions is similar to horizontal_fill logic but extracts only—useful but redundant if run after fills.
 * Function get_inner assumes first non-empty row, but if sections have bg-only inners initially, returns None and skips fills (bug in trains).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows uniform block fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4s in cols 1-5, 8s in 8-12; rows 8-13 6s/7s/4s) suggesting horizontal_fill worked for large segments, but vertical propagation seems absent or incomplete (e.g., no blending between row blocks 6-7 and 8-14, which should be sections separated by all-1 rows); inter-section gaps (rows 7,14,21) remain all 1s (proto?), but expected would fill based on chain adjacency if blocks like 4-8-9 adjacent.
 * Test output over-relies on horizontal: entire rows filled uniformly without vertical consistency (e.g., row 15-20 has 9-4-5-3 blocks, but no upward propagation from chain row 27 [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] into gaps); chain includes 1s (proto?), which shouldn't be in chain—extract_chain filters them, but output suggests misdetection (bg=1? but 1 is proto, detect_bg skips proto so bg likely another).
 * Test output misses subtle overlaps: e.g., if sections at rows 0-6 (4/8/9) and 8-13 (6/7/4), gap row 7 should fill where 4 and 6 adjacent in chain (preceding color), but remains 1s; similarly, lower sections not bridged (e.g., 9 and 4 in rows 15-20 and 22-26 should fill row 21 if adjacent).
 * Bg detection likely wrong—upper rows have 1s (proto) and some colors, but if 1 dominates non-proto count? No, detect_bg counts non-proto, so bg= some color like 1? Wait, proto=1 skipped, so bg= most common other (but output fills with colors, not bg); output has 1s as walls but fills bg-spots with colors correctly in blocks, but no gap fills, suggesting inter-section logic broken for large grids (29 cols).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for intra-section fills but ignores chain-based bridging, leaving gaps unfilled—does not match expected full completion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where regions of colored cells (numbers 2-9) are partially filled, separated by prototype walls (1's) and background (typically 8's or similar empty spaces), and the goal is to propagate and fill the background spaces with appropriate colors based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a specific row (often the second-to-last row, excluding backgrounds and prototypes). The filling follows horizontal and vertical propagation within sections bounded by prototypes, and bridging gaps between sections using chain-based color matching, ultimately producing a completed grid that matches expected patterns without overfilling or misapplying colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototypes (proto=1) act as walls or dividers that bound sections; they should not be overwritten, and filling stops at them.
 * Background (bg, often 8) is the empty space to fill; detection of bg is crucial and should be the most common non-proto color in early rows (code uses rows 0 to n-3).
 * The chain is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, which serves as a reference for "adjacent preceding" color rules—e.g., if two colors A and B are adjacent in the chain (in either order), a fill color C can bridge them if C precedes them adjacently in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling occurs within rows, filling bg gaps between proto walls if the segment has a single dominant color, and bridging adjacent segments if their colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Vertical propagation fills bg within column segments bounded by proto in a section, using the single color if present.
 * Sections are contiguous row groups (from 0 to n-3) that contain some but not all proto in a row; gaps between sections (rows with all bg or all proto?) are bridged vertically by finding overlapping horizontal regions in "inner" rows of adjacent sections and filling the gap rows with chain-derived colors where overlaps match.
 * Subtlety: "Inner" rows for bridging are the first non-proto/bg row in a section; if none, skip. Overlaps are horizontal position-based (max start to min end).
 * Chain adjacency check (is_adjacent_preceding) returns the preceding color if A and B are neighbors in chain, but only if they match exactly (order flexible); if A==B, return A. This is used for bridging but may fail if chain order matters directionally (unobserved).
 * Gaps between sections only fill where upper and lower regions overlap horizontally; non-overlapping areas stay bg.
 * Easy to miss: Full-row bg or proto rows (like rows n-1 and n-2 in some examples) are not processed for sections or chain if excluded; chain is strictly from row n-2 non-bg/proto cells.
 * Another subtlety: In vertical propagation, collect colors in a column segment excluding bg/proto, and fill only if exactly one unique color; multi-color segments don't fill.
 * Horizontal fill first applies to all rows 0 to n-3, then vertical within sections, then inter-section bridging—order matters to avoid overfilling.
 * Bg detection scans only early rows (0 to n-3), assuming later rows are chain/reserved; if grid has varying bg, this fails.
 * In examples, some expected fillings create vertical stacks (e.g., 2's and 6's in gaps) that span multiple rows, suggesting bridging applies to entire gap height.
 * Proto rows can be partial; sections end when a row is all proto or no proto.
 * Chain may have duplicates or orders that imply directionality (e.g., 2 before 3 allows filling with 2 between 3-regions? But code returns preceding, which may be wrong).
 * Test inputs may have different bg (e.g., 1 as bg?) or wider grids, requiring robust detection.
 * Unobserved: Some expected outputs leave certain bg unfilled if no chain match, or fill with specific colors from chain positions.

    # (Full as in code.)
```

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `get_inner`: Attempts to find first non-bg/proto row in section for bridging reference, but in examples, it picks rows that lead to wrong overlaps (e.g., picks filled rows, causing no bridging).
- `get_filled_regions`: Extracts single-color segments between proto in a row, but when used for bridging, it fails to align upper/lower overlaps correctly, leading to no fills in gaps.
- Overall program structure: Applies horizontal fill to all rows first (good), vertical within sections (partial), but inter-section bridging is flawed—wrong inner row selection and overlap logic miss vertical stacks in gaps.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects bg=8 and extracts chain (e.g., in Train 1: [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5,...]), and applies some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., fills single-color segments like 7's in Train 1 row 2).
 * Horizontal fill works partially: In Train 1, it correctly fills some bg to match colors within segments (e.g., row 1 fills 1's), but overfills bridges incorrectly (e.g., fills 7's where expected has 8's in row 1 cols 11-13).
 * Vertical propagation works in simple cases but misses in complex sections: In Train 1, it fills some but leaves gaps unfilled vertically.
 * Section finding identifies partial-proto row groups correctly (e.g., Train 1 sections at rows 1-4 and 8-11), but bridging between sections fails entirely—no fills in gap rows 5-7 and 12-13, where expected has vertical 2's (cols 2-3) and 6's (cols 16-17) based on chain adjacency (e.g., 2 precedes 1? Chain links needed).
 * In Train 1 generated vs expected: Rows 1 differs (generated fills 7's in cols 11-13 and 1's in 14-17; expected has 8's in 11-13); rows 5-7 all 8's in generated but expected has 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17 across 3 rows; row 12 all 8's but expected has 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; row 13 differs (generated has 1's/4's/2's but expected has 1's/8's). Reason unknown but likely wrong overlap detection in bridging.
 * In Train 2 generated vs expected: Minimal filling (many 8's stay); row 1 has extra 2 in col 4 (generated) vs 8 expected; rows 4-5 all 8's but expected row 4 has 3/6/7 isolated; no bridging fills vertical gaps (e.g., expected row 4 has scattered colors, but generated leaves empty). Chain [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] not used for bridging.
 * In Train 3 generated vs expected: Fills some horizontals (e.g., row 1 3's and 2's match), but verticals overfill (e.g., rows 4-5 duplicate row 1 fills incorrectly); sections found but bridging misses (rows 6 empty, expected has 9 in col 19; rows 12-16 all 8's but expected has 6's in col 11 across 5 rows); rows 17-22 have partial 1's but expected has 8's in many places and 9/7 isolated. Overpropagation in vertical func likely.
 * extract_chain is essential and correct for adjacency rules.
 * horizontal_fill is partially helpful but bridges too aggressively without checking chain direction.
 * vertical_propagate_within is useful but skips multi-color segments correctly—issue is in section bounds.
 * find_sections works but excludes gap rows properly.
 * is_adjacent_preceding may be broken: Returns preceding (left) in chain, but expected bridges might need the common predecessor or something else (unknown why gaps like 2's in Train 1).
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are incorrect for bridging: Wrong row selection (e.g., picks bottom of section) and overlap calc misses vertical extension to full gap height.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of sections and chain but fails bridging logic, leading to empty gaps where expected has stacked colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massively with 1's (likely misdetected as bg or proto), creating solid rows of 1's (e.g., row 0 all 1's, row 26 all 1's) where expected likely has structured regions and bg preserved in non-fill areas.
 * It applies some block fills (e.g., 4's in rows 1-6 cols 1-5, 9's in rows 1-6 cols 20-24, 6's in rows 8-14 cols 1-5), which may match intra-section propagation, but chain-based bridging seems absent (e.g., row 14 has 4's but no connection to upper/lower; rows 15-16 have mixed but overfilled with 1's in non-region spots).
 * Gaps like between rows 6-7 (all 1's/9's but mismatched) and rows 20-25 (7's but bordered by 1's) suggest failed section detection or bg=1 misfill, leaving no empty spaces and ignoring chain (unseen, but likely [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] from row 27).
 * This doesn't make sense as a completed puzzle—too uniform with 1's everywhere outside blocks, unlike training expecteds that preserve bg in non-connected areas and use chain for targeted fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where numbers represent colors or barriers: 1 acts as walls/barriers (proto), 8 is typically background (bg), other numbers (2-9) are specific colors to propagate and fill into bg areas. The goal is to fill bg cells with appropriate colors based on connected uniform regions, vertical/horizontal propagation within wall-bounded sections, and gap-filling between sections using adjacency rules derived from a "chain" (likely a key sequence) extracted from near the bottom of the grid, ensuring shapes and separations match implied puzzle logic like nonograms or region-filling with constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into segments/regions both horizontally (within rows) and vertically (across rows); sections are defined as consecutive rows that contain some 1's but are not entirely 1's, and propagation must respect these boundaries without crossing full-1 rows or unrelated areas.
 * Background (bg, usually 8) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows; it must be filled only where a uniform color can be inferred from adjacent non-bg/non-proto cells, but never overwrite existing colors or 1's.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row, capturing non-bg/non-proto cells as a sequence of colors (e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in train1); this acts as an adjacency key—fills between regions use a color from the chain only if two adjacent regions' colors (a and b) appear next to each other in the chain, preferring the "preceding" one in the pair.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, segments between 1's (or edges) should be filled with a single color if all non-bg/non-proto cells in that segment share one color; bg cells in the segment get that color, but gaps between filled segments (still bg) get filled via chain if the bounding segments' colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a detected section (consecutive partial-1 rows), fill vertically column-by-column: if a vertical segment between 1's has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, propagate that color to all bg cells in that vertical run; do not cross 1's or section boundaries.
 * Gap filling between sections: For gaps (all-8 or partial rows) between two sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section), get their horizontal filled regions, and for overlapping column ranges between upper/lower regions with colors a/b, if a and b are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rectangle (overlapping columns, all gap rows) with the preceding color from the chain pair; only fill bg or 1's in those positions (but 1's might be subtle—avoid overwriting true walls?).
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency is bidirectional but returns the "preceding" color in the pair (e.g., if chain has ...a,b..., fill with a; if ...b,a..., fill with b); sections must exclude the last two rows (header/footer?); inner row selection picks the first row in a section with any non-1/bg, but if none, skip; do not fill if segment colors aren't uniform (len(seg_colors)==1); gaps only if gap_start <= gap_end; vertical propagation skips 1's but fills around them if uniform; chain extraction ignores bg and 1's but preserves order; in multi-row uniform blocks, ensure consistency across rows; bottom row (and possibly second-bottom) is the key and should remain unchanged; full-8 rows separate sections but aren't sections themselves; overlapping regions in gap-fill use max/min columns for projection.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal fill must happen before vertical/section detection (as in code), but gap-fill after; chain might have duplicates (e.g., two 2's in train1), so adjacency checks all pairs; if no uniform color, leave as bg; vertical fill only within section bounds, not across gaps; in train3, large sections need multi-row consistency; test grid has wider layout with more colors (3-9), so chain likely longer; do not fill the very top/bottom rows unless they fit section rules; bg detection scans only upper rows (n-2) to avoid key contamination.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding but incomplete implementation of propagation and gap-filling rules.
 * Horizontal filling worked partially: In train1, upper sections (rows 1-4) correctly filled uniform 1/2/5/7 segments between 1's, but failed to fill intra-row gaps between segments (e.g., row1 generated 1's but left 7/8 areas as 8's instead of using chain); similar in train2 (filled some 1/2/3/5/7 but left row1's 2-block incomplete) and train3 (filled multi-row 1/3/2/9 blocks but missed vertical consistency in lower sections).
 * Vertical propagation worked somewhat: In train1, it extended colors within sections (e.g., 2's and 5's in rows 2-3), but skipped or failed in wider blocks; in train2, filled rows5-7 correctly for 1/4/6/9 but not row4 gaps; in train3, extended upper 1/3/2 blocks across rows1-5 but left lower sections (rows8-11) with incomplete 4/6 fills (e.g., row9 has 6 but not propagated fully).
 * Section detection worked basically: Correctly identified partial-1 row groups (e.g., train1 sections at rows0-4 and 8-11; train2 at 0-2 and 5-7; train3 at 0-5 and 8-11 and 17-21), excluding full-8 and last two rows, but <n-2 limit missed some lower sections in train3 (e.g., rows17-21 detected but propagation incomplete).
 * Gap filling failed entirely: No fills in inter-section gaps; e.g., train1 generated all-8 rows5-7 where expected has 2/6 blocks (projected from upper/lower), and row12 all-8 vs expected 9/2; train2 row4 all-8 vs expected 3/6/7 blocks; train3 row6-7 and row12-16 all-8 vs expected 9/6 blocks—likely because get_inner returned valid rows but overlap checks (o_l > o_r) or chain adjacency failed (e.g., wrong preceding color or no match); also, perform_gap_fills skipped if no inner or gap too small.
 * Chain extraction worked: For train1, likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] matching bottom; used in horizontal but not effectively in gaps (e.g., 2 and 6 should fill with preceding if adjacent in chain, but didn't).
 * Bg detection worked: 8 correctly identified in all.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: perform_gap_fills is broken (no fills occur, possibly due to strict overlap or fill_c None; overwrites proto=1 in gaps? but shouldn't); get_filled_regions misses non-uniform post-fill; vertical_propagate_within skips too aggressively (leaves bg in multi-color verticals, but examples need uniform check); overall program modifies grid_out in-place but doesn't handle multi-section gaps or chain duplicates well; no function for full-grid uniformity check post-fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete propagation and missing gap fills similar to training failures; e.g., rows1-6 have 4's and 8's filled horizontally but no vertical extension to row6's partial 9's, and row7-8 all 1's (possibly misbg?) where gaps should project colors like 9's from above; rows8-12 fill 6/7/4 but row13 cuts 4's short (ends with 1's instead of full block), suggesting horizontal_fill failed end-segment; row15 has 9/5/3 blocks but row16 all 1's (gap unfilled, should project from row15 to row20's 3/7?); rows21-25 fill 3 then 7's but inconsistently (row21 3's full, rows22-26 7's but row26 all 1's?); bottom key row27 has 4/8/9/etc. unchanged (good), but overall lacks vertical consistency in lower half (e.g., 5/3/7 blocks not propagated up from key projections) and gap rectangles (e.g., between row12 and row14, no 4/5/3 fills); compared to training patterns, it over-relies on horizontal (matches upper 4/8/9 shapes) but misses chain-based gap/vertical for lower (e.g., expected likely has 7's extending up from row22 into row16 gap, using chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 5-7); without expected, it differs by leaving too many 1's/bg in gaps/verticals, making shapes incomplete (e.g., 4-block in row13-14 not uniform height).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where a 2D grid represents a visual scene with background cells (typically 8), wall/prototype cells (1), and partial colored regions (numbers 2-9). The goal is to propagate and fill background cells with colors based on uniformity in rows/columns, adjacency rules from a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row, and rules for filling gaps between vertically separated "sections" of the grid defined by partial wall rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg, usually 8) cells must only be filled if they can be unambiguously propagated from adjacent uniform colored segments; never overwrite existing colors, walls (proto=1), or other non-bg cells.
 * The "chain" is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, used to determine if two colors are "adjacent" (i.e., appear next to each other in the chain, in either order) for gap-filling; if so, the preceding color in the chain can fill gaps between matching segments.
 * Sections are contiguous groups of rows (up to n-2) that contain at least one proto=1 but are not entirely proto=1; these define bounded areas for vertical propagation.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, identify segments between proto walls; if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, for adjacent segments, if their colors are adjacent in the chain, fill bg gaps between them with the preceding color from the chain pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section and per column, fill bg cells in stretches between proto walls using the single uniform color in that stretch if present.
 * Inter-section filling: Between consecutive sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-proto/bg row in each section), extract uniform colored regions from those rows, find overlapping column ranges between upper and lower regions, and if the colors are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rows (between sections) in those columns with the preceding chain color—but only if both sections have valid inner rows.
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency checks must consider order (preceding color matters, not just presence); sections exclude the last two rows (n-1 and n-2 are reserved for chain/bottom); bg detection counts non-proto in upper rows (0 to n-3) to find the most common non-proto as bg; do not fill if segments have multiple colors; gap filling between sections only applies to bg cells and only in overlapping columns; empty sections or no inner row skips filling; chain may have duplicates or gaps, but adjacency is pairwise consecutive only.
 * Edge cases: All-proto rows end sections; no sections means no vertical/inter-section filling; chain may be empty (no gap filling); varying grid widths (m) and heights (n); test inputs may have larger/more complex sections; bottom two rows (including chain row) are never modified; proto=1 is fixed and blocks propagation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Horizontal filling often works for intra-row uniformity but fails on chain-based gap filling if is_adjacent_preceding returns wrong preceding color; vertical propagation misses if sections are misidentified (e.g., including all-proto rows); inter-section filling fails if inner rows are not correctly selected (e.g., picking a row with no non-bg cells) or if overlap detection ignores partial overlaps; bg detection assumes upper rows, but if grid is small (n<3), chain/extractions return empty; no handling for multiple chains or non-standard proto/bg; fillings can cascade (horizontal then vertical then inter-section), so order matters.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it implements a full pipeline (bg detection, chain extraction, horizontal/vertical filling, section-based inter-filling) showing partial understanding of propagation rules.
 * Horizontal filling works correctly for uniform segments in rows (e.g., fills 1-regions around 2/5/7 in ex1 rows 2-3) but fails chain-based gaps (e.g., doesn't fill between 7 and 1 in ex1 row1 correctly, leaving extra 1's unfilled? Wait, actually overfills some 7's into bg areas).
 * Vertical propagation succeeds in sections for uniform columns (e.g., fills 5's vertically in ex1) but misses if sections are wrong (e.g., in ex3, doesn't fill lower vertical stacks like 6's in rows 13-17).
 * Section finding is mostly correct (identifies partial-wall groups) but excludes last two rows properly; however, inter-section gap filling fails entirely—e.g., in ex1, gaps between sections (rows 5-7) remain all bg instead of filling 2's and 6's based on chain adjacency from upper/lower inners; similarly, row12 gap unfilled for 9's/2's.
 * In ex2, horizontal fills some (e.g., 2/5/7 in row2) but misses vertical in sections and all inter-section (row4 remains bg, expected 3/6/7); chain extraction works but not applied between sections.
 * In ex3, fills upper sections horizontally/vertically (e.g., 3/2 in rows1-4) but misses many lower fillings (e.g., rows7-12 partial, rows13-17 all bg instead of 6's, rows18-22 unfilled 1-regions); inter-section skips due to no inner or overlap issues.
 * Bg detection works (identifies 8 correctly); chain extraction is accurate but underused (adjacency only for horizontal, not fully for vertical/gaps).
 * Overall, intra-section filling (horizontal/vertical) partially succeeds (~50% in ex1/3), but inter-section logic broken (no gap fills observed); no overfilling of proto or bottom rows, but underfilling dominates.
 * Function `get_inner` is helpful but fragile (returns first non-proto/bg row, but if none, skips—happens in ex1 row12?); `get_filled_regions` good for extracting uniform segments but only used post-horizontal, so misses if horizontal incomplete.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `horizontal_fill` has redundant comps building (could fill in one pass); entire inter-section loop assumes consecutive sections only and max/min overlap, but doesn't handle non-overlapping or multi-region overlaps well (e.g., ex3 complex widths).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows large uniform blocks filled (e.g., rows1-5 all 4's in cols1-5, 8's in cols8-12, 9's in cols20-24; rows8-12 6's/7's/4's; rows15-19 9's/4's/5's/3's; rows21-25 7's), with horizontal propagation seeming applied but vertical/inter-section incomplete (e.g., rows6-7 and13-14 all 1's suggest no gap filling between sections; bottom row28 has scattered colors but row27 all 1's unfilled).
 * It matches a pattern of filling wide uniform regions but leaves potential section gaps as 1's (which may be proto, but expected likely fills bg=1? Wait, test uses 1 as bg/proto? Confusion: test grid has 1 as bg/proto, differing from training's 8/1—program hardcodes proto=1, detects bg=1? But output fills over 1's incorrectly, e.g., row1 all 1's unfilled but should propagate if sections present.
 * Differences: Overfills entire blocks without wall respect (e.g., rows1-5 ignore potential proto in input); misses vertical uniformity (e.g., col1 all 1's/4's/6's/9's but not propagated down sections); chain-based gaps not filled (e.g., between row5-6 and row12-13, remains 1's); bottom row28 has 4/8/9/... but no propagation to row27; overall, looks like horizontal-only filling on assumed input sections, ignoring inter-section rules—does not match expected full propagation seen in training diffs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where background areas (bg) are filled with colors based on propagation rules within and between sections delimited by prototype walls (value 1), using horizontal filling of uniform segments, vertical propagation inside sections, and inter-section filling guided by overlapping colored regions and an adjacency chain extracted from near the bottom of the grid. The chain represents a sequence of colors that determines allowable fills between adjacent but separated colors (a and b can be bridged by a preceding color in the chain if they appear adjacent in it).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (1) acts as walls/barriers that segment the grid into sections; sections are identified by consecutive rows that contain some but not all 1s (mixed proto and non-proto).
 * Background (bg, often 0 or unfilled) is filled only if a segment/region has exactly one non-bg, non-proto color; multi-color segments are not filled.
 * Horizontal filling occurs first across all non-bottom rows, unifying bg in uniform-color gaps between 1s and bridging gaps between adjacent uniform segments if their colors are "adjacent" in the chain (i.e., appear next to each other in chain, filling with the preceding one).
 * Vertical propagation happens only within each section (between section start/end), filling bg in columns if the vertical segment in that column has exactly one color; it expands to cover the min-max range of that color's positions but skips over 1s.
 * Inter-section filling targets gaps between consecutive sections (rows from upper section end+1 to lower start-1), but only in columns where upper and lower "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section) have overlapping uniform colored regions; fill uses chain adjacency, and only bg is overwritten.
 * Chain extraction is from the second-to-last row (n-2), collecting non-bg, non-proto values in order, skipping 1s— this row often contains the "key" sequence of isolated colors separated by 1s.
 * Adjacency check in chain is symmetric (a then b or b then a) but returns the preceding color for filling; if a==b, use a directly.
 * Bottom two rows (n-1 and possibly n-2) are treated specially: n-1 is all 1s or bg, n-2 provides chain; no filling applied to bottom rows.
 * Subtle: "Inner" row for a section is the first row within it that has any non-1, non-bg; if none, skip inter-fill for that section pair.
 * Subtle: Overlap for inter-fill is strict (max start to min end of regions); no fill if no overlap or no chain link.
 * Edge cases: Empty sections, single-row sections, full-proto rows (not sections), grids with n<2 (return as-is), or chain with duplicates/self-adjacencies.
 * No overwriting of existing non-bg colors; only bg is filled. Sections must have mixed rows (some 1s but not all) to qualify—pure non-proto rows aren't sections for vertical prop.
 * Propagation doesn't cross sections vertically or use chain for intra-section fills; chain is only for horizontal bridges and inter-section gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(This extracts the color sequence from the penultimate row, ignoring bg and proto—essential for determining fill colors between adjacent regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(This checks chain for adjacency and returns the bridging color—core for all fill decisions; handles self-match directly.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    n = len(grid)
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):

            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as consecutive rows up to n-2 with partial proto coverage—key for scoping vertical and inter-fills; excludes bottom rows.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    # (as provided in attempt; fills uniform segments between protos with their single color, and bridges gaps between adjacent segments using chain)
```
(Helpful for initial horizontal unification across all rows.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    # (as provided; fills vertical bg segments within a section/column if single color present, expanding to min-max of that color)
```
(Helpful for intra-section vertical filling, but note it skips protos and only acts on bg.)

```python
def get_inner(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # (as provided; finds first row in section with any non-proto non-bg for inter-section reference)
```
(Helpful for selecting representative rows for overlap in inter-fills.)

```python
def get_filled_regions(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # (as provided; extracts uniform single-color segments between protos in a row, ignoring bg)
```
(Helpful for identifying regions in inner rows for overlap checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, indicating solid implementation of horizontal filling, section detection, vertical propagation within sections, and basic inter-section filling via chain.
 * What worked: Chain extraction accurately pulls the key sequence; horizontal_fill unifies bg in uniform gaps and bridges via chain adjacency; vertical_propagate_within properly scopes to sections and fills single-color verticals without crossing walls; section finding skips bottom rows and pure rows correctly.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, large areas are over-filled with 2 (likely from chain having many 2s or self-adjacency), but isolated higher numbers (e.g., 4,8,9 in rows 3,10,17) are preserved as "seeds" without surrounding fills, suggesting incomplete propagation around them—expected more bridging if chain allows (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 4 in chain, gaps near 4 should fill with preceding color, but appear as bg or unfilled in output? Wait, output shows 2s around them, but perhaps not vertically between sections).
 * Missed potential: Inter-section filling seems limited; in test output, the lower section (rows ~20-25) has 2s only on the right, with left all 1s, but if overlaps exist with upper sections' inner rows (which have scattered 4,8,etc.), more fills expected in gaps (rows 11-16? appear all 2s, but row 17 has mixed—perhaps sections misidentified).
 * extract_chain is essential and correct (pulls from n-2, which in test output became [1,4,1,8,...] after fills? No, chain extracted before fills, so from input's n-2).
 * horizontal_fill is helpful but may over-apply bridges if chain has long 2-2 sequences, leading to uniform 2 floods.
 * vertical_propagate_within is mostly correct but in test, columns with mixed seeds (e.g., col 3 has 4 in row3, 6 in row10, 9 in row17) aren't unified vertically across sections, which is intended (only within), but gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) remain 2-filled horizontally, potentially correct if no overlap trigger.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are essential for inter-fills but may fail if inner row is all bg after horizontal (test output has inner rows with seeds like row3, so okay); however, overlaps might be too narrow, missing wider fills.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though find_sections excludes i >= n-2 strictly, which is good but subtle if input has proto in bottom.

**Test output:**
 * The test output fills most of the grid with 2s in large horizontal bands (e.g., rows 1-2,4-9,11-16,18-20,22-23,25-26), preserving isolated higher colors (4,8,9 in row3; 6,7,4 in row10; 9,4,2,5,3 in row17; 7 in row23) surrounded by 2s or 1s, which makes sense if 2 is a dominant chain color and seeds are non-propagated starts.
 * It looks partially correct: Bottom row all 1s (untouched), second-last all 1s (perhaps input was mixed, but filled to proto? No, code doesn't fill bottom), chain row (row 27 in output) has isolated 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7 separated by 1s, matching expected chain preservation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 20-25) has 2s only in columns 20-24, with left side all 1s—no vertical propagation or inter-fill into left bg areas, suggesting missed overlaps with upper mixed rows (e.g., row17 has colors up to col23, should overlap and fill gaps above row20 if chain links, but remains 1/bg? Output shows 1s, implying no fill triggered—perhaps get_inner picks a row without left colors).
 * Gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) are fully 2-filled horizontally, which seems correct if upper/lower inners overlap in cols 3,10,22 (where seeds are) and chain has 2-4/2-8 etc., but vertically in those columns, bg above/below seeds isn't filled (e.g., col3 row4=2, but if vertical prop within section, why not extend from seed? Sections may not include seed rows if they are full-mixed).
 * Row 0 and row 28 all 1s (top/bottom borders, correct untouched). Row 21 all 1s? Wait, output row20 is mixed 1s and 2s on right—looks like partial section. Overall, over-reliance on 2 suggests chain starts/bridges with 2, but scattered seeds in row17 (cols 3,9,11,15-16,18,22) aren't bridged horizontally in that row (gaps are 2s, but if multi-color, no fill—correct, but expected more inter-fill below).
 * The output makes sense for a 2-dominant fill but misses potential fills in left-lower areas and between scattered seeds, differing from expectation of fuller propagation if sections/overlaps are broader; unknown if input had more bg in lower left, but output leaves it as 1s (proto? or bg not filled—code sets bg to colors, but if input 1s, untouched).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a walled structure (using 1 as proto/walls) with background (likely 0) and colored regions (numbers like 2,3,4,...), where the goal is to fill empty background areas horizontally and vertically based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a key row near the bottom of the grid. The filling propagates colors between wall-separated regions only if the bordering colors are adjacent in the chain sequence, using the preceding or matching color from the chain to decide the fill color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is identified from the last row's first cell, assumed to be 0 or empty; all fills target only bg cells without overwriting existing colors or walls.
 * The chain is a sequence of non-bg colors extracted from the second-to-last row (grid[n-2]), representing an ordering of colors that defines valid adjacencies for filling (e.g., colors must appear consecutively in the chain to allow propagation between regions).
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into sections both vertically (stacks of wall rows) and horizontally (within rows); sections are contiguous blocks of rows with at least one proto in them.
 * Vertical filling occurs between non-adjacent vertical sections (with gap rows in between) by identifying "inner" rows in each section (first non-pure-proto/bg row), extracting uniform-color regions in those inners, and filling overlapping horizontal spans in the gap rows with a color from the chain if the bordering region colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling happens within individual rows, between consecutive walls, filling bg in uniform-color regions if bordering colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Subtlety: Regions must be uniform single-color (no mixed colors within a wall-bounded segment) to be considered for filling; scattered same-color cells in a segment don't qualify unless contiguous (code uses min/max j of js, but assumes uniformity).
 * Adjacency in chain is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color based on order (if a then b, return a; if b then a, return b), which might imply directionality in propagation (e.g., fill with the earlier-in-chain color).
 * Easy to miss: Vertical sections skip the last two rows (while i < n-2), assuming the chain and bg rows are at the bottom and not part of sections; inner rows are chosen as the first row in a section with non-proto/bg content.
 * Gaps between sections must have no overlap in filling logic; if sections are adjacent (end1 +1 >= start2), no vertical fill.
 * Chain extraction ignores bg and proto, but assumes the row has meaningful sequence; if chain <2 elements, no filling.
 * Overwriting only bg; existing colors (like special numbers 3-9) stay, so fills don't propagate over pre-placed colors.
 * Grid dimensions: Assumes rectangular (n rows, m cols); early returns if n<3.
 * Potential edge case: Multiple regions per inner row; filling only where horizontal overlaps exist between upper/lower regions.
 * Chain may include duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's), allowing multiple adjacencies; is_adjacent_preceding checks for exact pairs in sequence, not just presence.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it successfully handled all three training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating solid core logic for basic vertical and horizontal filling between wall sections using chain adjacencies.
 * Worked well for identifying bg (0), extracting chain from second-last row, and finding vertical sections excluding bottom two rows.
 * Vertical fill correctly skips adjacent sections and only fills gaps where inner-row regions overlap horizontally and colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Horizontal fill properly identifies regions between walls in rows and fills if adjacent in chain, but only within the same row.
 * What didn't work/may be limited: get_inner_row picks only the first valid row in a section, potentially missing multi-row sections with varying inner content; if a section has no qualifying inner row (all proto/bg), skips entirely.
 * get_regions requires strictly uniform single color per inter-wall segment (set len==1), which works if regions are solid but may fail if input has pre-filled partials or mixed bg/colors; it also takes min/max of js but doesn't ensure full coverage (e.g., holes in region ignored).
 * is_adjacent_preceding is symmetric but biased toward the order in chain (returns the first in pair), which succeeded in training but might not handle reverse propagation or multi-hop chains.
 * No extraction of "objects" per se (e.g., full blobs or connected components); focuses on wall-bounded regions, which is helpful but assumes walls define all boundaries—may miss open areas without walls.
 * horizontal_fill re-extracts regions per row (redundant with get_regions) and uses index k of walls for positioning, which is functional but inefficient; it fills only between consecutive regions in the same row.
 * vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are applied sequentially (vert then horiz), which may overwrite or miss interactions if horiz creates new adjacencies for vert (but since copies grid, it's one-pass).
 * No handling for chain colors not present in regions (fills only if exact match); assumes proto=1 fixed, bg dynamic.
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of wall-section-chain rules but may underfill in complex test cases with multi-layer sections or non-uniform inners.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from lists) with heavy use of 1's as walls/borders, large areas filled with 2's (likely the dominant chain color), and isolated special colors (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) placed in specific positions across rows 3,10,17,23, matching a pattern like staggered "key" placements vertically aligned with the bottom chain row 27: [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,...].
 * It looks partially correct: Upper sections (rows 0-6,8-13) are mostly 2-filled between walls with specials like 4,8,9,6,7,4 in row 3/10, suggesting vertical propagation of 2's where adjacent to chain (assuming 2 is prevalent in chain), and specials are preserved (not overwritten).
 * Middle section (rows 15-19) has expanded 2's in central columns (14-19) with specials 9,4,5,3, indicating horizontal/vertical fills triggered by chain adjacencies (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 9/4/5/3, fill 2 in overlaps).
 * Lower sections (rows 21-25) have narrower 2-fills (columns 20-24) with 7 in row 23, showing localized filling, possibly due to narrower wall sections or no overlap with upper regions.
 * What doesn't look correct: Many areas remain as 1's or potentially unfilled (though output shows no explicit 0's, assuming bg was 0 and filled to 2's where possible); for example, rows 1-2,4-5, etc., mirror row structures but fill only 2's around specials without propagating the specials themselves upward/downward—e.g., the 4 in row 3 col 3 isn't filled vertically into row 2 col 3 (still 2?), suggesting vertical_fill didn't trigger for that pair (perhaps no chain adjacency between 4 and bordering 2, or no gap/overlap). Similarly, central expansions in rows 15-19 seem correct, but lower partial fills (only cols 20-24) differ from upper full-width 2's, possibly missing vertical propagation across full horizontal span if chain doesn't support wider overlaps. Bottom rows 26-28 are all 1's except the chain in 27, which is preserved correctly. Overall, it makes sense for a chain-heavy-2 puzzle but appears incomplete in propagating specials (e.g., no 4/8/9 fills beyond their input positions), which might be expected if the puzzle requires filling gaps with adjacent chain colors including specials; unknown if input had these specials pre-placed or if filling should expand them—differs from expectation of fuller special propagation if chain allows (e.g., if 4 adjacent to 2, why not fill more 4's?).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 21:35:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling of background areas (likely 8 in training examples, 1 in test) using rules based on "prototype" walls (fixed as 1), sections of rows with partial walls, and a "chain" of colors extracted from near the bottom row to determine valid adjacencies for filling gaps horizontally, vertically within sections, and between sections. The goal is to fill unknown/background cells with colors that maintain connectivity and adjacency rules derived from the chain, without overfilling or violating section boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (proto=1) acts as walls that divide rows into segments; sections are groups of consecutive rows (excluding top 2 and bottom 2?) that contain some but not all 1's, used for vertical propagation.
 * Background (bg) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in the top rows (excluding last 2); in training it's 8, but test uses 1 as apparent bg/walls interchangeably, suggesting code's fixed proto=1 may not generalize if inputs vary.
 * Chain is extracted from the second-to-last row, keeping only non-bg non-proto cells; used to check "adjacent preceding" pairs (if a and b are neighbors in chain or swapped, return the first/preceding one as fill color).
 * Horizontal filling: Within rows, fill bg gaps between walls if the segment has exactly one color; then bridge gaps between filled segments using chain adjacency if colors match a valid pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section, for each column, fill bg in vertical runs bounded by walls if the run has exactly one non-bg color, but skip edges if at section boundaries.
 * Between sections: Identify "inner" rows (first non-proto non-bg row in section), get horizontal filled regions, find overlapping column ranges between upper/lower sections' regions, and fill bg in the gap rows between sections using chain adjacency of the region colors.
 * Subtlety: Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color (first in pair); if a==b, return a directly.
 * Easy to miss: Sections exclude rows that are all-proto or no-proto; filling only happens if exactly one color in segment (avoids mixing); vertical fill skips boundary rows in sections to avoid over-propagation; between-sections fill only in overlapping columns and only if adjacency exists.
 * Chain may have duplicates or order matters for "preceding"; no filling if no valid adjacency or no overlap.
 * Gaps between sections only filled if inner rows exist and regions align; entire grid copy to avoid mutating input.
 * Potential issue: Code assumes n>=3, fixed proto=1; may fail if bg==1 or variable protos; doesn't handle empty sections or single-row sections well.
 * All training examples have a bottom chain row (row 25) with isolated colors separated by bg, likely the key for adjacencies (e.g., 3,2,9,4,6,7).

        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the last (and only shown) submission; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating core horizontal filling, chain extraction, and basic vertical propagation work for simple cases without between-section gaps or complex overlaps.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated incorrectly filled row 2 with 3's in columns 6-8 (where expected has 8's/bg) and 2's in 14-16 (expected 8's); row 6 lacks the isolated 9 in column 19 (expected has it, generated has 1? but shown as 1's); rows 12-16 have all 8's in column 11 where expected has 6's (failed vertical propagation or section detection); row 7 has no 9, and lower sections missed 6's entirely—likely due to flawed between-sections filling or inner row selection not capturing isolated colors.
 * Horizontal_fill worked partially (filled 1's correctly in many places) but overfilled bridges using chain (e.g., 1-3 adjacency assumed but not valid, or chain order wrong).
 * Vertical_propagate_within seems broken for training 3: Didn't propagate 6's downward in column 11 across rows 12-16, possibly because sections weren't detected correctly or fill_start/end skipped too much.
 * Between-sections logic in main program failed: For gap around row 6-7, didn't place the 9; for lower gaps, missed propagating 6's—likely inner_u/inner_l selection wrong (get_inner returns first non-empty row, but may need all or different), or overlap detection (o_s/o_e) too strict, or no adjacency in chain for relevant pairs.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are helpful but subtle: get_inner picks first valid row, which may miss if sections have varying inner rows; get_filled_regions identifies uniform segments correctly but only if already horizontally filled.
 * find_sections likely missed sections in training 3 (e.g., rows with isolated protos not grouped), leading to no vertical fill for 6's.
 * Overall, code handles single-section or no-gap cases (training 1/2) but breaks on multi-section with isolated colors and gaps (training 3); chain adjacency may not handle non-consecutive pairs or duplicates well.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all shown are relevant, but vertical_propagate_within and between-sections loop need debugging for edge cases like single-cell regions or boundary skips.

**Test output:**
 * The test generated output appears mostly correct at a glance but has potential issues: It propagates colors like 2,4,8,9 horizontally/vertically within apparent sections (e.g., rows 1-5 have consistent blocks of 4's and 8's/9's), and bridges some using likely chain (e.g., row 15 has 2's extended to columns 14-18 and 20-24, suggesting adjacency fill); lower sections (rows 16-20) fill 9/4/5/3 blocks vertically across 3 rows, which matches vertical propagation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Row 8 is all 1's (bg?), but if it's a separator, expected might have partial fills; row 21 has 2's in 20-24 but input/generated shows consistent filling—unknown if overfills (e.g., row 15's middle 2's in 14-18/20-24 may bridge incorrectly if chain doesn't allow 2-2 self-adjacency across gap). Rows 22-25 have 7's propagated vertically but only in 20-24, and row 26 all 1's—seems correct, but row 27 (chain?) has isolated colors without filling around them, which matches rules (no fill in chain row).
 * Bottom row 28 all 1's expected; the isolated colors in row 27 (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) likely form the chain, and output didn't alter them, which is good—but upper fills (e.g., 6's in rows 9-12 columns 1-5) propagated down correctly, but row 15's 2's extension to column 14-18/20-24 might be wrong if no direct chain adjacency (unknown without input chain order).
 * Key difference: Test input (inferred from output patterns) has wider grid (29 cols?) with more sections; code filled most but possibly missed between-section gaps (e.g., rows 6-7/13-14 all 1's, no cross-fills shown); looks 80% correct but subtle overfills in row 15 suggest chain adjacency misapplied (e.g., self-adjacency for 2's allowed but maybe only for distinct pairs).
 * To handle test: Need to verify chain order matches bottom isolated (e.g., if chain is 4-8-9-... , then 2-4 adjacency might fill, but 2 self-bridge in gaps may be invalid); output makes sense overall but not perfect—account for larger m and more sections.

[2025-09-30 21:35:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1). The filling propagates colors from the chain into background areas, but only where components are adjacent in the chain and connect properly through the grid's outlined shapes, without overfilling or ignoring vertical extensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is consistently the dominant filler (e.g., 8 in training examples 1 and 2, 1 in example 3 and test), identified from the bottom-left of the last row; all empty spaces start as bg.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row (n-2), filtering non-bg cells to form a sequence of colors that serves as a key for filling; positions in the chain matter for adjacency (e.g., colors at positions differing by 1 are adjacent).
 * "Proto" is the outline color (e.g., 1), found in rows above the chain by identifying rows with exactly one non-bg color; this acts as a boundary or connector, and fillings should not overwrite proto but can bridge through gaps in proto-outlined regions.
 * Components in each row (i < n-2) are contiguous non-bg segments; for each row, identify sub-components (groups of same-color cells), excluding bg and proto, and assign a primary color (proto if no other, or the dominant non-proto/bg color).
 * Filling occurs only between adjacent components in the same row if their colors are adjacent in the chain (checked via position proximity in chain, e.g., any pair of positions abs(diff)==1); gaps are filled with the chain's color at the minimal position of the adjacent pair.
 * Subtlety: Filling is horizontal within rows but must account for vertical propagation or extension from the chain upwards, especially into all-bg areas directly above chain positions (e.g., creating vertical blobs like 2x3 in train1 rows 6-7); the current program only fills horizontally and skips proto-adjacent cases, missing these verticals.
 * Do not fill if either component involves proto (current skip condition is too broad: "if comps[k][2] == proto or comps[k + 1][2] == proto: continue"), which prevents necessary bridging.
 * Chain adjacency check uses all positions of a color (pos1 + pos2), finding min_p for fill color, but fails if colors appear multiple times non-adjacently; this works for simple cases but misses multi-occurrence logic.
 * Grids have varying widths (20 in train1/2, 27 in train3, 29 in test); ensure m = len(grid[0]) handles this.
 * Outlined shapes (e.g., 1's forming boundaries around inner colors like 2,3,4) suggest enclosed regions that should be filled consistently with chain colors, but only where connected vertically/horizontally without crossing outlines.
 * Last two rows are fixed (chain in n-2, bg in n-1); processing only affects rows 0 to n-3.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical stacking of fillings (e.g., expected train1 has 3-row vertical 2's and 6's in rows 6-8, but generated has none); program doesn't propagate upwards iteratively.
 * No diagonal connections; only orthogonal (horizontal in row, vertical implied by chain position).
 * Colors 2-9 are fillers; 1/8 often bg or proto, but bg varies per grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    return [grid[n-2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n-2][j] != bg]

# Helpful inline snippet: Find proto (outline color)
def find_proto(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> int:
    for row in grid[:-2]:
        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:
    non_bg_pos = [j for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] != bg]
    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where regions bounded by prototype walls (1) and background (typically 8) are filled with colors (2-9) by propagating single-color dominance within segments, vertically within wall-defined sections, and horizontally/vertically across section gaps if colors are adjacent in a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row; the goal is to complete the grid without overfilling or misapplying rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows (0 to n-3), but only if present; empty grids return unchanged.
 * Chain extraction takes the second-last row (n-2), filtering out bg and proto to get a sequence of colors that defines "adjacency" for filling (e.g., if a and b are neighbors in chain, the preceding color can fill gaps between regions of a and b).
 * Horizontal filling occurs in every upper row (0 to n-3): between proto walls, if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, between adjacent filled segments with colors a and b, if they are adjacent in chain, fill the proto/bg gap with the preceding color from the adjacency.
 * Sections are contiguous blocks of rows (from 0 to n-3) that contain some (but not all) proto cells; these define vertical propagation zones.
 * Vertical propagation within a section: for each column, between proto cells, if the non-bg/non-proto cells in the vertical segment have exactly one color, fill bg cells in that segment with it.
 * Inter-section filling: between consecutive sections, for gap rows, if inner rows of sections have horizontally overlapping filled regions with colors a and b that are adjacent in chain, fill the entire overlapping vertical/horizontal gap area with the preceding color—but only if regions overlap horizontally (max start <= min end +1).
 * Subtlety: get_inner picks the first non-bg/non-proto row in a section as representative for region extraction; this assumes sections have consistent inner structure but can miss if sections have varying filled rows.
 * Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the preceding color (first in the pair), and same colors return themselves; no filling if no adjacency.
 * Proto (1) acts as walls/barriers; bg is never propagated as a color.
 * Edge cases: empty segments, all-proto rows (skipped), no chain (no inter-fills), sections touching (no gap), or non-overlapping regions (no cross-fill).
 * The bottom two rows (n-2 and n-1) are typically the chain and a fixed bottom bar; they are not processed for filling.
 * Overfilling risk: horizontal fill runs before sections, so it can create filled regions used in vertical/inter steps; but vertical only within sections, not across.
 * Assumption: grids are rectangular, colors 1-9, bg dominant in empties.

(Performs horizontal segment filling and gap filling within a row; key for initial color spread.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture: horizontal and vertical propagation work partially, but inter-section gap filling and section detection miss cases.
 * Train 1: Generated filled upper sections correctly (e.g., 1-2-5-7 blocks in rows 1-4), but failed to fill gap between sections 0-4 and 8-11 (expected 2 in cols 2-3 rows 5-7, 6 in cols 15-16 rows 5-7; generated all 8s); also overfilled row 12 with 9s in cols 8-9 (expected 8s), and misplaced 9s in row 12; bottom chain row 18 has correct sequence but no propagation upward.
 * Train 1: get_inner selected row 8 for second section, but expected fillings suggest propagation from row 9-11; horizontal_fill didn't bridge non-adjacent chain pairs (e.g., 2 and 6 not adjacent in chain [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]).
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled some bg with 1 or 2 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 4=2 but expected 8; row 4 cols 6=3 but expected 8 in a proto-heavy area); missed vertical propagation in section 4-7 (expected isolated 3,6,7 in row 4 cols 6,10,14 but generated 8s); sections misdetected, leading to no gap fill between upper and lower blocks.
 * Train 2: Chain likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] from row 11, but is_adjacent_preceding not applied correctly for cross-section (e.g., no fill for 3-6-7 isolation); horizontal_fill filled some segments but skipped gaps due to multi-color or non-adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated upper sections (rows 1-5 all filled similarly, but expected varied with 8s in some proto areas); missed vertical fills in lower sections (e.g., rows 13-17 expected 6 in col 11, but generated 8s; rows 17-21 expected isolated 8s but filled with 1s erroneously); inter-section gap (rows 6-7 and 12) not filled (expected 9 in row 6 col 19, 6 in rows 13-17 col 11).
 * Train 3: Larger grid (27 cols) exposed section detection bug—find_sections skipped some partial-proto rows (e.g., row 20 has partial but treated as full bg); vertical_propagate_within overfilled 1s into bg areas; chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] not used for gaps between multi-section blocks.
 * Overall: horizontal_fill works for single-color segments but fails gap fills if chain order wrong or segments not adjacent; vertical_propagate_within skips multi-color verticals correctly but doesn't handle section edges; inter-section logic in program() buggy—get_filled_regions uses inner row only, missing if inner has no fills yet, and overlap check (max(st1,st2) <= min(en1,en2)+1) too strict, preventing non-exact overlaps; no iteration (fills don't propagate after initial horizontal).
 * Function vertical_propagate_within is helpful but limited to sections—extend to full columns? But no, rules confine to sections.
 * Function get_filled_regions is similar to horizontal_fill logic but extracts only—useful but redundant if run after fills.
 * Function get_inner assumes first non-empty row, but if sections have bg-only inners initially, returns None and skips fills (bug in trains).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows uniform block fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4s in cols 1-5, 8s in 8-12; rows 8-13 6s/7s/4s) suggesting horizontal_fill worked for large segments, but vertical propagation seems absent or incomplete (e.g., no blending between row blocks 6-7 and 8-14, which should be sections separated by all-1 rows); inter-section gaps (rows 7,14,21) remain all 1s (proto?), but expected would fill based on chain adjacency if blocks like 4-8-9 adjacent.
 * Test output over-relies on horizontal: entire rows filled uniformly without vertical consistency (e.g., row 15-20 has 9-4-5-3 blocks, but no upward propagation from chain row 27 [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] into gaps); chain includes 1s (proto?), which shouldn't be in chain—extract_chain filters them, but output suggests misdetection (bg=1? but 1 is proto, detect_bg skips proto so bg likely another).
 * Test output misses subtle overlaps: e.g., if sections at rows 0-6 (4/8/9) and 8-13 (6/7/4), gap row 7 should fill where 4 and 6 adjacent in chain (preceding color), but remains 1s; similarly, lower sections not bridged (e.g., 9 and 4 in rows 15-20 and 22-26 should fill row 21 if adjacent).
 * Bg detection likely wrong—upper rows have 1s (proto) and some colors, but if 1 dominates non-proto count? No, detect_bg counts non-proto, so bg= some color like 1? Wait, proto=1 skipped, so bg= most common other (but output fills with colors, not bg); output has 1s as walls but fills bg-spots with colors correctly in blocks, but no gap fills, suggesting inter-section logic broken for large grids (29 cols).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for intra-section fills but ignores chain-based bridging, leaving gaps unfilled—does not match expected full completion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where regions of colored cells (numbers 2-9) are partially filled, separated by prototype walls (1's) and background (typically 8's or similar empty spaces), and the goal is to propagate and fill the background spaces with appropriate colors based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a specific row (often the second-to-last row, excluding backgrounds and prototypes). The filling follows horizontal and vertical propagation within sections bounded by prototypes, and bridging gaps between sections using chain-based color matching, ultimately producing a completed grid that matches expected patterns without overfilling or misapplying colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototypes (proto=1) act as walls or dividers that bound sections; they should not be overwritten, and filling stops at them.
 * Background (bg, often 8) is the empty space to fill; detection of bg is crucial and should be the most common non-proto color in early rows (code uses rows 0 to n-3).
 * The chain is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, which serves as a reference for "adjacent preceding" color rules—e.g., if two colors A and B are adjacent in the chain (in either order), a fill color C can bridge them if C precedes them adjacently in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling occurs within rows, filling bg gaps between proto walls if the segment has a single dominant color, and bridging adjacent segments if their colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Vertical propagation fills bg within column segments bounded by proto in a section, using the single color if present.
 * Sections are contiguous row groups (from 0 to n-3) that contain some but not all proto in a row; gaps between sections (rows with all bg or all proto?) are bridged vertically by finding overlapping horizontal regions in "inner" rows of adjacent sections and filling the gap rows with chain-derived colors where overlaps match.
 * Subtlety: "Inner" rows for bridging are the first non-proto/bg row in a section; if none, skip. Overlaps are horizontal position-based (max start to min end).
 * Chain adjacency check (is_adjacent_preceding) returns the preceding color if A and B are neighbors in chain, but only if they match exactly (order flexible); if A==B, return A. This is used for bridging but may fail if chain order matters directionally (unobserved).
 * Gaps between sections only fill where upper and lower regions overlap horizontally; non-overlapping areas stay bg.
 * Easy to miss: Full-row bg or proto rows (like rows n-1 and n-2 in some examples) are not processed for sections or chain if excluded; chain is strictly from row n-2 non-bg/proto cells.
 * Another subtlety: In vertical propagation, collect colors in a column segment excluding bg/proto, and fill only if exactly one unique color; multi-color segments don't fill.
 * Horizontal fill first applies to all rows 0 to n-3, then vertical within sections, then inter-section bridging—order matters to avoid overfilling.
 * Bg detection scans only early rows (0 to n-3), assuming later rows are chain/reserved; if grid has varying bg, this fails.
 * In examples, some expected fillings create vertical stacks (e.g., 2's and 6's in gaps) that span multiple rows, suggesting bridging applies to entire gap height.
 * Proto rows can be partial; sections end when a row is all proto or no proto.
 * Chain may have duplicates or orders that imply directionality (e.g., 2 before 3 allows filling with 2 between 3-regions? But code returns preceding, which may be wrong).
 * Test inputs may have different bg (e.g., 1 as bg?) or wider grids, requiring robust detection.
 * Unobserved: Some expected outputs leave certain bg unfilled if no chain match, or fill with specific colors from chain positions.

    # (Full as in code.)
```

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `get_inner`: Attempts to find first non-bg/proto row in section for bridging reference, but in examples, it picks rows that lead to wrong overlaps (e.g., picks filled rows, causing no bridging).
- `get_filled_regions`: Extracts single-color segments between proto in a row, but when used for bridging, it fails to align upper/lower overlaps correctly, leading to no fills in gaps.
- Overall program structure: Applies horizontal fill to all rows first (good), vertical within sections (partial), but inter-section bridging is flawed—wrong inner row selection and overlap logic miss vertical stacks in gaps.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects bg=8 and extracts chain (e.g., in Train 1: [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5,...]), and applies some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., fills single-color segments like 7's in Train 1 row 2).
 * Horizontal fill works partially: In Train 1, it correctly fills some bg to match colors within segments (e.g., row 1 fills 1's), but overfills bridges incorrectly (e.g., fills 7's where expected has 8's in row 1 cols 11-13).
 * Vertical propagation works in simple cases but misses in complex sections: In Train 1, it fills some but leaves gaps unfilled vertically.
 * Section finding identifies partial-proto row groups correctly (e.g., Train 1 sections at rows 1-4 and 8-11), but bridging between sections fails entirely—no fills in gap rows 5-7 and 12-13, where expected has vertical 2's (cols 2-3) and 6's (cols 16-17) based on chain adjacency (e.g., 2 precedes 1? Chain links needed).
 * In Train 1 generated vs expected: Rows 1 differs (generated fills 7's in cols 11-13 and 1's in 14-17; expected has 8's in 11-13); rows 5-7 all 8's in generated but expected has 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17 across 3 rows; row 12 all 8's but expected has 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; row 13 differs (generated has 1's/4's/2's but expected has 1's/8's). Reason unknown but likely wrong overlap detection in bridging.
 * In Train 2 generated vs expected: Minimal filling (many 8's stay); row 1 has extra 2 in col 4 (generated) vs 8 expected; rows 4-5 all 8's but expected row 4 has 3/6/7 isolated; no bridging fills vertical gaps (e.g., expected row 4 has scattered colors, but generated leaves empty). Chain [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] not used for bridging.
 * In Train 3 generated vs expected: Fills some horizontals (e.g., row 1 3's and 2's match), but verticals overfill (e.g., rows 4-5 duplicate row 1 fills incorrectly); sections found but bridging misses (rows 6 empty, expected has 9 in col 19; rows 12-16 all 8's but expected has 6's in col 11 across 5 rows); rows 17-22 have partial 1's but expected has 8's in many places and 9/7 isolated. Overpropagation in vertical func likely.
 * extract_chain is essential and correct for adjacency rules.
 * horizontal_fill is partially helpful but bridges too aggressively without checking chain direction.
 * vertical_propagate_within is useful but skips multi-color segments correctly—issue is in section bounds.
 * find_sections works but excludes gap rows properly.
 * is_adjacent_preceding may be broken: Returns preceding (left) in chain, but expected bridges might need the common predecessor or something else (unknown why gaps like 2's in Train 1).
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are incorrect for bridging: Wrong row selection (e.g., picks bottom of section) and overlap calc misses vertical extension to full gap height.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of sections and chain but fails bridging logic, leading to empty gaps where expected has stacked colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massively with 1's (likely misdetected as bg or proto), creating solid rows of 1's (e.g., row 0 all 1's, row 26 all 1's) where expected likely has structured regions and bg preserved in non-fill areas.
 * It applies some block fills (e.g., 4's in rows 1-6 cols 1-5, 9's in rows 1-6 cols 20-24, 6's in rows 8-14 cols 1-5), which may match intra-section propagation, but chain-based bridging seems absent (e.g., row 14 has 4's but no connection to upper/lower; rows 15-16 have mixed but overfilled with 1's in non-region spots).
 * Gaps like between rows 6-7 (all 1's/9's but mismatched) and rows 20-25 (7's but bordered by 1's) suggest failed section detection or bg=1 misfill, leaving no empty spaces and ignoring chain (unseen, but likely [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] from row 27).
 * This doesn't make sense as a completed puzzle—too uniform with 1's everywhere outside blocks, unlike training expecteds that preserve bg in non-connected areas and use chain for targeted fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where numbers represent colors or barriers: 1 acts as walls/barriers (proto), 8 is typically background (bg), other numbers (2-9) are specific colors to propagate and fill into bg areas. The goal is to fill bg cells with appropriate colors based on connected uniform regions, vertical/horizontal propagation within wall-bounded sections, and gap-filling between sections using adjacency rules derived from a "chain" (likely a key sequence) extracted from near the bottom of the grid, ensuring shapes and separations match implied puzzle logic like nonograms or region-filling with constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into segments/regions both horizontally (within rows) and vertically (across rows); sections are defined as consecutive rows that contain some 1's but are not entirely 1's, and propagation must respect these boundaries without crossing full-1 rows or unrelated areas.
 * Background (bg, usually 8) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows; it must be filled only where a uniform color can be inferred from adjacent non-bg/non-proto cells, but never overwrite existing colors or 1's.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row, capturing non-bg/non-proto cells as a sequence of colors (e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in train1); this acts as an adjacency key—fills between regions use a color from the chain only if two adjacent regions' colors (a and b) appear next to each other in the chain, preferring the "preceding" one in the pair.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, segments between 1's (or edges) should be filled with a single color if all non-bg/non-proto cells in that segment share one color; bg cells in the segment get that color, but gaps between filled segments (still bg) get filled via chain if the bounding segments' colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a detected section (consecutive partial-1 rows), fill vertically column-by-column: if a vertical segment between 1's has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, propagate that color to all bg cells in that vertical run; do not cross 1's or section boundaries.
 * Gap filling between sections: For gaps (all-8 or partial rows) between two sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section), get their horizontal filled regions, and for overlapping column ranges between upper/lower regions with colors a/b, if a and b are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rectangle (overlapping columns, all gap rows) with the preceding color from the chain pair; only fill bg or 1's in those positions (but 1's might be subtle—avoid overwriting true walls?).
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency is bidirectional but returns the "preceding" color in the pair (e.g., if chain has ...a,b..., fill with a; if ...b,a..., fill with b); sections must exclude the last two rows (header/footer?); inner row selection picks the first row in a section with any non-1/bg, but if none, skip; do not fill if segment colors aren't uniform (len(seg_colors)==1); gaps only if gap_start <= gap_end; vertical propagation skips 1's but fills around them if uniform; chain extraction ignores bg and 1's but preserves order; in multi-row uniform blocks, ensure consistency across rows; bottom row (and possibly second-bottom) is the key and should remain unchanged; full-8 rows separate sections but aren't sections themselves; overlapping regions in gap-fill use max/min columns for projection.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal fill must happen before vertical/section detection (as in code), but gap-fill after; chain might have duplicates (e.g., two 2's in train1), so adjacency checks all pairs; if no uniform color, leave as bg; vertical fill only within section bounds, not across gaps; in train3, large sections need multi-row consistency; test grid has wider layout with more colors (3-9), so chain likely longer; do not fill the very top/bottom rows unless they fit section rules; bg detection scans only upper rows (n-2) to avoid key contamination.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding but incomplete implementation of propagation and gap-filling rules.
 * Horizontal filling worked partially: In train1, upper sections (rows 1-4) correctly filled uniform 1/2/5/7 segments between 1's, but failed to fill intra-row gaps between segments (e.g., row1 generated 1's but left 7/8 areas as 8's instead of using chain); similar in train2 (filled some 1/2/3/5/7 but left row1's 2-block incomplete) and train3 (filled multi-row 1/3/2/9 blocks but missed vertical consistency in lower sections).
 * Vertical propagation worked somewhat: In train1, it extended colors within sections (e.g., 2's and 5's in rows 2-3), but skipped or failed in wider blocks; in train2, filled rows5-7 correctly for 1/4/6/9 but not row4 gaps; in train3, extended upper 1/3/2 blocks across rows1-5 but left lower sections (rows8-11) with incomplete 4/6 fills (e.g., row9 has 6 but not propagated fully).
 * Section detection worked basically: Correctly identified partial-1 row groups (e.g., train1 sections at rows0-4 and 8-11; train2 at 0-2 and 5-7; train3 at 0-5 and 8-11 and 17-21), excluding full-8 and last two rows, but <n-2 limit missed some lower sections in train3 (e.g., rows17-21 detected but propagation incomplete).
 * Gap filling failed entirely: No fills in inter-section gaps; e.g., train1 generated all-8 rows5-7 where expected has 2/6 blocks (projected from upper/lower), and row12 all-8 vs expected 9/2; train2 row4 all-8 vs expected 3/6/7 blocks; train3 row6-7 and row12-16 all-8 vs expected 9/6 blocks—likely because get_inner returned valid rows but overlap checks (o_l > o_r) or chain adjacency failed (e.g., wrong preceding color or no match); also, perform_gap_fills skipped if no inner or gap too small.
 * Chain extraction worked: For train1, likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] matching bottom; used in horizontal but not effectively in gaps (e.g., 2 and 6 should fill with preceding if adjacent in chain, but didn't).
 * Bg detection worked: 8 correctly identified in all.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: perform_gap_fills is broken (no fills occur, possibly due to strict overlap or fill_c None; overwrites proto=1 in gaps? but shouldn't); get_filled_regions misses non-uniform post-fill; vertical_propagate_within skips too aggressively (leaves bg in multi-color verticals, but examples need uniform check); overall program modifies grid_out in-place but doesn't handle multi-section gaps or chain duplicates well; no function for full-grid uniformity check post-fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete propagation and missing gap fills similar to training failures; e.g., rows1-6 have 4's and 8's filled horizontally but no vertical extension to row6's partial 9's, and row7-8 all 1's (possibly misbg?) where gaps should project colors like 9's from above; rows8-12 fill 6/7/4 but row13 cuts 4's short (ends with 1's instead of full block), suggesting horizontal_fill failed end-segment; row15 has 9/5/3 blocks but row16 all 1's (gap unfilled, should project from row15 to row20's 3/7?); rows21-25 fill 3 then 7's but inconsistently (row21 3's full, rows22-26 7's but row26 all 1's?); bottom key row27 has 4/8/9/etc. unchanged (good), but overall lacks vertical consistency in lower half (e.g., 5/3/7 blocks not propagated up from key projections) and gap rectangles (e.g., between row12 and row14, no 4/5/3 fills); compared to training patterns, it over-relies on horizontal (matches upper 4/8/9 shapes) but misses chain-based gap/vertical for lower (e.g., expected likely has 7's extending up from row22 into row16 gap, using chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 5-7); without expected, it differs by leaving too many 1's/bg in gaps/verticals, making shapes incomplete (e.g., 4-block in row13-14 not uniform height).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where a 2D grid represents a visual scene with background cells (typically 8), wall/prototype cells (1), and partial colored regions (numbers 2-9). The goal is to propagate and fill background cells with colors based on uniformity in rows/columns, adjacency rules from a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row, and rules for filling gaps between vertically separated "sections" of the grid defined by partial wall rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg, usually 8) cells must only be filled if they can be unambiguously propagated from adjacent uniform colored segments; never overwrite existing colors, walls (proto=1), or other non-bg cells.
 * The "chain" is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, used to determine if two colors are "adjacent" (i.e., appear next to each other in the chain, in either order) for gap-filling; if so, the preceding color in the chain can fill gaps between matching segments.
 * Sections are contiguous groups of rows (up to n-2) that contain at least one proto=1 but are not entirely proto=1; these define bounded areas for vertical propagation.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, identify segments between proto walls; if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, for adjacent segments, if their colors are adjacent in the chain, fill bg gaps between them with the preceding color from the chain pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section and per column, fill bg cells in stretches between proto walls using the single uniform color in that stretch if present.
 * Inter-section filling: Between consecutive sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-proto/bg row in each section), extract uniform colored regions from those rows, find overlapping column ranges between upper and lower regions, and if the colors are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rows (between sections) in those columns with the preceding chain color—but only if both sections have valid inner rows.
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency checks must consider order (preceding color matters, not just presence); sections exclude the last two rows (n-1 and n-2 are reserved for chain/bottom); bg detection counts non-proto in upper rows (0 to n-3) to find the most common non-proto as bg; do not fill if segments have multiple colors; gap filling between sections only applies to bg cells and only in overlapping columns; empty sections or no inner row skips filling; chain may have duplicates or gaps, but adjacency is pairwise consecutive only.
 * Edge cases: All-proto rows end sections; no sections means no vertical/inter-section filling; chain may be empty (no gap filling); varying grid widths (m) and heights (n); test inputs may have larger/more complex sections; bottom two rows (including chain row) are never modified; proto=1 is fixed and blocks propagation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Horizontal filling often works for intra-row uniformity but fails on chain-based gap filling if is_adjacent_preceding returns wrong preceding color; vertical propagation misses if sections are misidentified (e.g., including all-proto rows); inter-section filling fails if inner rows are not correctly selected (e.g., picking a row with no non-bg cells) or if overlap detection ignores partial overlaps; bg detection assumes upper rows, but if grid is small (n<3), chain/extractions return empty; no handling for multiple chains or non-standard proto/bg; fillings can cascade (horizontal then vertical then inter-section), so order matters.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it implements a full pipeline (bg detection, chain extraction, horizontal/vertical filling, section-based inter-filling) showing partial understanding of propagation rules.
 * Horizontal filling works correctly for uniform segments in rows (e.g., fills 1-regions around 2/5/7 in ex1 rows 2-3) but fails chain-based gaps (e.g., doesn't fill between 7 and 1 in ex1 row1 correctly, leaving extra 1's unfilled? Wait, actually overfills some 7's into bg areas).
 * Vertical propagation succeeds in sections for uniform columns (e.g., fills 5's vertically in ex1) but misses if sections are wrong (e.g., in ex3, doesn't fill lower vertical stacks like 6's in rows 13-17).
 * Section finding is mostly correct (identifies partial-wall groups) but excludes last two rows properly; however, inter-section gap filling fails entirely—e.g., in ex1, gaps between sections (rows 5-7) remain all bg instead of filling 2's and 6's based on chain adjacency from upper/lower inners; similarly, row12 gap unfilled for 9's/2's.
 * In ex2, horizontal fills some (e.g., 2/5/7 in row2) but misses vertical in sections and all inter-section (row4 remains bg, expected 3/6/7); chain extraction works but not applied between sections.
 * In ex3, fills upper sections horizontally/vertically (e.g., 3/2 in rows1-4) but misses many lower fillings (e.g., rows7-12 partial, rows13-17 all bg instead of 6's, rows18-22 unfilled 1-regions); inter-section skips due to no inner or overlap issues.
 * Bg detection works (identifies 8 correctly); chain extraction is accurate but underused (adjacency only for horizontal, not fully for vertical/gaps).
 * Overall, intra-section filling (horizontal/vertical) partially succeeds (~50% in ex1/3), but inter-section logic broken (no gap fills observed); no overfilling of proto or bottom rows, but underfilling dominates.
 * Function `get_inner` is helpful but fragile (returns first non-proto/bg row, but if none, skips—happens in ex1 row12?); `get_filled_regions` good for extracting uniform segments but only used post-horizontal, so misses if horizontal incomplete.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `horizontal_fill` has redundant comps building (could fill in one pass); entire inter-section loop assumes consecutive sections only and max/min overlap, but doesn't handle non-overlapping or multi-region overlaps well (e.g., ex3 complex widths).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows large uniform blocks filled (e.g., rows1-5 all 4's in cols1-5, 8's in cols8-12, 9's in cols20-24; rows8-12 6's/7's/4's; rows15-19 9's/4's/5's/3's; rows21-25 7's), with horizontal propagation seeming applied but vertical/inter-section incomplete (e.g., rows6-7 and13-14 all 1's suggest no gap filling between sections; bottom row28 has scattered colors but row27 all 1's unfilled).
 * It matches a pattern of filling wide uniform regions but leaves potential section gaps as 1's (which may be proto, but expected likely fills bg=1? Wait, test uses 1 as bg/proto? Confusion: test grid has 1 as bg/proto, differing from training's 8/1—program hardcodes proto=1, detects bg=1? But output fills over 1's incorrectly, e.g., row1 all 1's unfilled but should propagate if sections present.
 * Differences: Overfills entire blocks without wall respect (e.g., rows1-5 ignore potential proto in input); misses vertical uniformity (e.g., col1 all 1's/4's/6's/9's but not propagated down sections); chain-based gaps not filled (e.g., between row5-6 and row12-13, remains 1's); bottom row28 has 4/8/9/... but no propagation to row27; overall, looks like horizontal-only filling on assumed input sections, ignoring inter-section rules—does not match expected full propagation seen in training diffs.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling of background areas (likely 8 in training examples, 1 in test) using rules based on "prototype" walls (fixed as 1), sections of rows with partial walls, and a "chain" of colors extracted from near the bottom row to determine valid adjacencies for filling gaps horizontally, vertically within sections, and between sections. The goal is to fill unknown/background cells with colors that maintain connectivity and adjacency rules derived from the chain, without overfilling or violating section boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (proto=1) acts as walls that divide rows into segments; sections are groups of consecutive rows (excluding top 2 and bottom 2?) that contain some but not all 1's, used for vertical propagation.
 * Background (bg) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in the top rows (excluding last 2); in training it's 8, but test uses 1 as apparent bg/walls interchangeably, suggesting code's fixed proto=1 may not generalize if inputs vary.
 * Chain is extracted from the second-to-last row, keeping only non-bg non-proto cells; used to check "adjacent preceding" pairs (if a and b are neighbors in chain or swapped, return the first/preceding one as fill color).
 * Horizontal filling: Within rows, fill bg gaps between walls if the segment has exactly one color; then bridge gaps between filled segments using chain adjacency if colors match a valid pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section, for each column, fill bg in vertical runs bounded by walls if the run has exactly one non-bg color, but skip edges if at section boundaries.
 * Between sections: Identify "inner" rows (first non-proto non-bg row in section), get horizontal filled regions, find overlapping column ranges between upper/lower sections' regions, and fill bg in the gap rows between sections using chain adjacency of the region colors.
 * Subtlety: Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color (first in pair); if a==b, return a directly.
 * Easy to miss: Sections exclude rows that are all-proto or no-proto; filling only happens if exactly one color in segment (avoids mixing); vertical fill skips boundary rows in sections to avoid over-propagation; between-sections fill only in overlapping columns and only if adjacency exists.
 * Chain may have duplicates or order matters for "preceding"; no filling if no valid adjacency or no overlap.
 * Gaps between sections only filled if inner rows exist and regions align; entire grid copy to avoid mutating input.
 * Potential issue: Code assumes n>=3, fixed proto=1; may fail if bg==1 or variable protos; doesn't handle empty sections or single-row sections well.
 * All training examples have a bottom chain row (row 25) with isolated colors separated by bg, likely the key for adjacencies (e.g., 3,2,9,4,6,7).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the last (and only shown) submission; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating core horizontal filling, chain extraction, and basic vertical propagation work for simple cases without between-section gaps or complex overlaps.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated incorrectly filled row 2 with 3's in columns 6-8 (where expected has 8's/bg) and 2's in 14-16 (expected 8's); row 6 lacks the isolated 9 in column 19 (expected has it, generated has 1? but shown as 1's); rows 12-16 have all 8's in column 11 where expected has 6's (failed vertical propagation or section detection); row 7 has no 9, and lower sections missed 6's entirely—likely due to flawed between-sections filling or inner row selection not capturing isolated colors.
 * Horizontal_fill worked partially (filled 1's correctly in many places) but overfilled bridges using chain (e.g., 1-3 adjacency assumed but not valid, or chain order wrong).
 * Vertical_propagate_within seems broken for training 3: Didn't propagate 6's downward in column 11 across rows 12-16, possibly because sections weren't detected correctly or fill_start/end skipped too much.
 * Between-sections logic in main program failed: For gap around row 6-7, didn't place the 9; for lower gaps, missed propagating 6's—likely inner_u/inner_l selection wrong (get_inner returns first non-empty row, but may need all or different), or overlap detection (o_s/o_e) too strict, or no adjacency in chain for relevant pairs.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are helpful but subtle: get_inner picks first valid row, which may miss if sections have varying inner rows; get_filled_regions identifies uniform segments correctly but only if already horizontally filled.
 * find_sections likely missed sections in training 3 (e.g., rows with isolated protos not grouped), leading to no vertical fill for 6's.
 * Overall, code handles single-section or no-gap cases (training 1/2) but breaks on multi-section with isolated colors and gaps (training 3); chain adjacency may not handle non-consecutive pairs or duplicates well.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all shown are relevant, but vertical_propagate_within and between-sections loop need debugging for edge cases like single-cell regions or boundary skips.

**Test output:**
 * The test generated output appears mostly correct at a glance but has potential issues: It propagates colors like 2,4,8,9 horizontally/vertically within apparent sections (e.g., rows 1-5 have consistent blocks of 4's and 8's/9's), and bridges some using likely chain (e.g., row 15 has 2's extended to columns 14-18 and 20-24, suggesting adjacency fill); lower sections (rows 16-20) fill 9/4/5/3 blocks vertically across 3 rows, which matches vertical propagation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Row 8 is all 1's (bg?), but if it's a separator, expected might have partial fills; row 21 has 2's in 20-24 but input/generated shows consistent filling—unknown if overfills (e.g., row 15's middle 2's in 14-18/20-24 may bridge incorrectly if chain doesn't allow 2-2 self-adjacency across gap). Rows 22-25 have 7's propagated vertically but only in 20-24, and row 26 all 1's—seems correct, but row 27 (chain?) has isolated colors without filling around them, which matches rules (no fill in chain row).
 * Bottom row 28 all 1's expected; the isolated colors in row 27 (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) likely form the chain, and output didn't alter them, which is good—but upper fills (e.g., 6's in rows 9-12 columns 1-5) propagated down correctly, but row 15's 2's extension to column 14-18/20-24 might be wrong if no direct chain adjacency (unknown without input chain order).
 * Key difference: Test input (inferred from output patterns) has wider grid (29 cols?) with more sections; code filled most but possibly missed between-section gaps (e.g., rows 6-7/13-14 all 1's, no cross-fills shown); looks 80% correct but subtle overfills in row 15 suggest chain adjacency misapplied (e.g., self-adjacency for 2's allowed but maybe only for distinct pairs).
 * To handle test: Need to verify chain order matches bottom isolated (e.g., if chain is 4-8-9-... , then 2-4 adjacency might fill, but 2 self-bridge in gaps may be invalid); output makes sense overall but not perfect—account for larger m and more sections.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where background areas (bg) are filled with colors based on propagation rules within and between sections delimited by prototype walls (value 1), using horizontal filling of uniform segments, vertical propagation inside sections, and inter-section filling guided by overlapping colored regions and an adjacency chain extracted from near the bottom of the grid. The chain represents a sequence of colors that determines allowable fills between adjacent but separated colors (a and b can be bridged by a preceding color in the chain if they appear adjacent in it).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (1) acts as walls/barriers that segment the grid into sections; sections are identified by consecutive rows that contain some but not all 1s (mixed proto and non-proto).
 * Background (bg, often 0 or unfilled) is filled only if a segment/region has exactly one non-bg, non-proto color; multi-color segments are not filled.
 * Horizontal filling occurs first across all non-bottom rows, unifying bg in uniform-color gaps between 1s and bridging gaps between adjacent uniform segments if their colors are "adjacent" in the chain (i.e., appear next to each other in chain, filling with the preceding one).
 * Vertical propagation happens only within each section (between section start/end), filling bg in columns if the vertical segment in that column has exactly one color; it expands to cover the min-max range of that color's positions but skips over 1s.
 * Inter-section filling targets gaps between consecutive sections (rows from upper section end+1 to lower start-1), but only in columns where upper and lower "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section) have overlapping uniform colored regions; fill uses chain adjacency, and only bg is overwritten.
 * Chain extraction is from the second-to-last row (n-2), collecting non-bg, non-proto values in order, skipping 1s— this row often contains the "key" sequence of isolated colors separated by 1s.
 * Adjacency check in chain is symmetric (a then b or b then a) but returns the preceding color for filling; if a==b, use a directly.
 * Bottom two rows (n-1 and possibly n-2) are treated specially: n-1 is all 1s or bg, n-2 provides chain; no filling applied to bottom rows.
 * Subtle: "Inner" row for a section is the first row within it that has any non-1, non-bg; if none, skip inter-fill for that section pair.
 * Subtle: Overlap for inter-fill is strict (max start to min end of regions); no fill if no overlap or no chain link.
 * Edge cases: Empty sections, single-row sections, full-proto rows (not sections), grids with n<2 (return as-is), or chain with duplicates/self-adjacencies.
 * No overwriting of existing non-bg colors; only bg is filled. Sections must have mixed rows (some 1s but not all) to qualify—pure non-proto rows aren't sections for vertical prop.
 * Propagation doesn't cross sections vertically or use chain for intra-section fills; chain is only for horizontal bridges and inter-section gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(This extracts the color sequence from the penultimate row, ignoring bg and proto—essential for determining fill colors between adjacent regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(This checks chain for adjacency and returns the bridging color—core for all fill decisions; handles self-match directly.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    n = len(grid)
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as consecutive rows up to n-2 with partial proto coverage—key for scoping vertical and inter-fills; excludes bottom rows.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    # (as provided in attempt; fills uniform segments between protos with their single color, and bridges gaps between adjacent segments using chain)
```
(Helpful for initial horizontal unification across all rows.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    # (as provided; fills vertical bg segments within a section/column if single color present, expanding to min-max of that color)
```
(Helpful for intra-section vertical filling, but note it skips protos and only acts on bg.)

```python
def get_inner(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # (as provided; finds first row in section with any non-proto non-bg for inter-section reference)
```
(Helpful for selecting representative rows for overlap in inter-fills.)

```python
def get_filled_regions(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # (as provided; extracts uniform single-color segments between protos in a row, ignoring bg)
```
(Helpful for identifying regions in inner rows for overlap checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, indicating solid implementation of horizontal filling, section detection, vertical propagation within sections, and basic inter-section filling via chain.
 * What worked: Chain extraction accurately pulls the key sequence; horizontal_fill unifies bg in uniform gaps and bridges via chain adjacency; vertical_propagate_within properly scopes to sections and fills single-color verticals without crossing walls; section finding skips bottom rows and pure rows correctly.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, large areas are over-filled with 2 (likely from chain having many 2s or self-adjacency), but isolated higher numbers (e.g., 4,8,9 in rows 3,10,17) are preserved as "seeds" without surrounding fills, suggesting incomplete propagation around them—expected more bridging if chain allows (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 4 in chain, gaps near 4 should fill with preceding color, but appear as bg or unfilled in output? Wait, output shows 2s around them, but perhaps not vertically between sections).
 * Missed potential: Inter-section filling seems limited; in test output, the lower section (rows ~20-25) has 2s only on the right, with left all 1s, but if overlaps exist with upper sections' inner rows (which have scattered 4,8,etc.), more fills expected in gaps (rows 11-16? appear all 2s, but row 17 has mixed—perhaps sections misidentified).
 * extract_chain is essential and correct (pulls from n-2, which in test output became [1,4,1,8,...] after fills? No, chain extracted before fills, so from input's n-2).
 * horizontal_fill is helpful but may over-apply bridges if chain has long 2-2 sequences, leading to uniform 2 floods.
 * vertical_propagate_within is mostly correct but in test, columns with mixed seeds (e.g., col 3 has 4 in row3, 6 in row10, 9 in row17) aren't unified vertically across sections, which is intended (only within), but gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) remain 2-filled horizontally, potentially correct if no overlap trigger.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are essential for inter-fills but may fail if inner row is all bg after horizontal (test output has inner rows with seeds like row3, so okay); however, overlaps might be too narrow, missing wider fills.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though find_sections excludes i >= n-2 strictly, which is good but subtle if input has proto in bottom.

**Test output:**
 * The test output fills most of the grid with 2s in large horizontal bands (e.g., rows 1-2,4-9,11-16,18-20,22-23,25-26), preserving isolated higher colors (4,8,9 in row3; 6,7,4 in row10; 9,4,2,5,3 in row17; 7 in row23) surrounded by 2s or 1s, which makes sense if 2 is a dominant chain color and seeds are non-propagated starts.
 * It looks partially correct: Bottom row all 1s (untouched), second-last all 1s (perhaps input was mixed, but filled to proto? No, code doesn't fill bottom), chain row (row 27 in output) has isolated 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7 separated by 1s, matching expected chain preservation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 20-25) has 2s only in columns 20-24, with left side all 1s—no vertical propagation or inter-fill into left bg areas, suggesting missed overlaps with upper mixed rows (e.g., row17 has colors up to col23, should overlap and fill gaps above row20 if chain links, but remains 1/bg? Output shows 1s, implying no fill triggered—perhaps get_inner picks a row without left colors).
 * Gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) are fully 2-filled horizontally, which seems correct if upper/lower inners overlap in cols 3,10,22 (where seeds are) and chain has 2-4/2-8 etc., but vertically in those columns, bg above/below seeds isn't filled (e.g., col3 row4=2, but if vertical prop within section, why not extend from seed? Sections may not include seed rows if they are full-mixed).
 * Row 0 and row 28 all 1s (top/bottom borders, correct untouched). Row 21 all 1s? Wait, output row20 is mixed 1s and 2s on right—looks like partial section. Overall, over-reliance on 2 suggests chain starts/bridges with 2, but scattered seeds in row17 (cols 3,9,11,15-16,18,22) aren't bridged horizontally in that row (gaps are 2s, but if multi-color, no fill—correct, but expected more inter-fill below).
 * The output makes sense for a 2-dominant fill but misses potential fills in left-lower areas and between scattered seeds, differing from expectation of fuller propagation if sections/overlaps are broader; unknown if input had more bg in lower left, but output leaves it as 1s (proto? or bg not filled—code sets bg to colors, but if input 1s, untouched).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a walled structure (using 1 as proto/walls) with background (likely 0) and colored regions (numbers like 2,3,4,...), where the goal is to fill empty background areas horizontally and vertically based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a key row near the bottom of the grid. The filling propagates colors between wall-separated regions only if the bordering colors are adjacent in the chain sequence, using the preceding or matching color from the chain to decide the fill color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is identified from the last row's first cell, assumed to be 0 or empty; all fills target only bg cells without overwriting existing colors or walls.
 * The chain is a sequence of non-bg colors extracted from the second-to-last row (grid[n-2]), representing an ordering of colors that defines valid adjacencies for filling (e.g., colors must appear consecutively in the chain to allow propagation between regions).
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into sections both vertically (stacks of wall rows) and horizontally (within rows); sections are contiguous blocks of rows with at least one proto in them.
 * Vertical filling occurs between non-adjacent vertical sections (with gap rows in between) by identifying "inner" rows in each section (first non-pure-proto/bg row), extracting uniform-color regions in those inners, and filling overlapping horizontal spans in the gap rows with a color from the chain if the bordering region colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling happens within individual rows, between consecutive walls, filling bg in uniform-color regions if bordering colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Subtlety: Regions must be uniform single-color (no mixed colors within a wall-bounded segment) to be considered for filling; scattered same-color cells in a segment don't qualify unless contiguous (code uses min/max j of js, but assumes uniformity).
 * Adjacency in chain is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color based on order (if a then b, return a; if b then a, return b), which might imply directionality in propagation (e.g., fill with the earlier-in-chain color).
 * Easy to miss: Vertical sections skip the last two rows (while i < n-2), assuming the chain and bg rows are at the bottom and not part of sections; inner rows are chosen as the first row in a section with non-proto/bg content.
 * Gaps between sections must have no overlap in filling logic; if sections are adjacent (end1 +1 >= start2), no vertical fill.
 * Chain extraction ignores bg and proto, but assumes the row has meaningful sequence; if chain <2 elements, no filling.
 * Overwriting only bg; existing colors (like special numbers 3-9) stay, so fills don't propagate over pre-placed colors.
 * Grid dimensions: Assumes rectangular (n rows, m cols); early returns if n<3.
 * Potential edge case: Multiple regions per inner row; filling only where horizontal overlaps exist between upper/lower regions.
 * Chain may include duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's), allowing multiple adjacencies; is_adjacent_preceding checks for exact pairs in sequence, not just presence.

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> int:
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b:
            return a
        if chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a:
            return b
    return None  # Checks chain adjacency and returns the "source" color; core logic for valid fills.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it successfully handled all three training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating solid core logic for basic vertical and horizontal filling between wall sections using chain adjacencies.
 * Worked well for identifying bg (0), extracting chain from second-last row, and finding vertical sections excluding bottom two rows.
 * Vertical fill correctly skips adjacent sections and only fills gaps where inner-row regions overlap horizontally and colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Horizontal fill properly identifies regions between walls in rows and fills if adjacent in chain, but only within the same row.
 * What didn't work/may be limited: get_inner_row picks only the first valid row in a section, potentially missing multi-row sections with varying inner content; if a section has no qualifying inner row (all proto/bg), skips entirely.
 * get_regions requires strictly uniform single color per inter-wall segment (set len==1), which works if regions are solid but may fail if input has pre-filled partials or mixed bg/colors; it also takes min/max of js but doesn't ensure full coverage (e.g., holes in region ignored).
 * is_adjacent_preceding is symmetric but biased toward the order in chain (returns the first in pair), which succeeded in training but might not handle reverse propagation or multi-hop chains.
 * No extraction of "objects" per se (e.g., full blobs or connected components); focuses on wall-bounded regions, which is helpful but assumes walls define all boundaries—may miss open areas without walls.
 * horizontal_fill re-extracts regions per row (redundant with get_regions) and uses index k of walls for positioning, which is functional but inefficient; it fills only between consecutive regions in the same row.
 * vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are applied sequentially (vert then horiz), which may overwrite or miss interactions if horiz creates new adjacencies for vert (but since copies grid, it's one-pass).
 * No handling for chain colors not present in regions (fills only if exact match); assumes proto=1 fixed, bg dynamic.
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of wall-section-chain rules but may underfill in complex test cases with multi-layer sections or non-uniform inners.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from lists) with heavy use of 1's as walls/borders, large areas filled with 2's (likely the dominant chain color), and isolated special colors (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) placed in specific positions across rows 3,10,17,23, matching a pattern like staggered "key" placements vertically aligned with the bottom chain row 27: [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,...].
 * It looks partially correct: Upper sections (rows 0-6,8-13) are mostly 2-filled between walls with specials like 4,8,9,6,7,4 in row 3/10, suggesting vertical propagation of 2's where adjacent to chain (assuming 2 is prevalent in chain), and specials are preserved (not overwritten).
 * Middle section (rows 15-19) has expanded 2's in central columns (14-19) with specials 9,4,5,3, indicating horizontal/vertical fills triggered by chain adjacencies (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 9/4/5/3, fill 2 in overlaps).
 * Lower sections (rows 21-25) have narrower 2-fills (columns 20-24) with 7 in row 23, showing localized filling, possibly due to narrower wall sections or no overlap with upper regions.
 * What doesn't look correct: Many areas remain as 1's or potentially unfilled (though output shows no explicit 0's, assuming bg was 0 and filled to 2's where possible); for example, rows 1-2,4-5, etc., mirror row structures but fill only 2's around specials without propagating the specials themselves upward/downward—e.g., the 4 in row 3 col 3 isn't filled vertically into row 2 col 3 (still 2?), suggesting vertical_fill didn't trigger for that pair (perhaps no chain adjacency between 4 and bordering 2, or no gap/overlap). Similarly, central expansions in rows 15-19 seem correct, but lower partial fills (only cols 20-24) differ from upper full-width 2's, possibly missing vertical propagation across full horizontal span if chain doesn't support wider overlaps. Bottom rows 26-28 are all 1's except the chain in 27, which is preserved correctly. Overall, it makes sense for a chain-heavy-2 puzzle but appears incomplete in propagating specials (e.g., no 4/8/9 fills beyond their input positions), which might be expected if the puzzle requires filling gaps with adjacent chain colors including specials; unknown if input had these specials pre-placed or if filling should expand them—differs from expectation of fuller special propagation if chain allows (e.g., if 4 adjacent to 2, why not fill more 4's?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 21:46:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where a partially colored canvas (with numbers 1-9 representing walls/proto=1 and colors, and 8 as background) must be completed by propagating and bridging colors horizontally and vertically, guided by a "chain" of allowed adjacent colors extracted from near the bottom row, ensuring fills respect wall boundaries and only use colors that are sequential in the chain for bridging gaps between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg=8) is the most common non-proto color in the top n-2 rows; it must be distinguished from actual colors (2-9) to avoid over-filling.
 * The chain is extracted from row n-2 (second-to-last row), including only non-bg, non-proto cells; this acts as a legend of sequential color adjacencies (e.g., if chain has ...A B..., A and B can bridge via fill with A if A precedes B).
 * Proto/walls (1) divide the grid into "sections" (consecutive rows with mixed proto and non-proto cells); vertical propagation fills bg within columns of a section only if a single non-bg/non-proto color dominates that column segment.
 * Horizontal fills occur row-by-row (for i in 0 to n-3): within a row, uniform-color segments (bounded by proto) get bg filled to match; adjacent segments bridge bg/proto gaps only if their colors are adjacent in the chain, filling with the preceding color in the pair.
 * Gaps between sections (rows between end of one section and start of next) are bridged vertically in overlapping column ranges: find uniform regions in "inner" rows of adjacent sections, check chain adjacency, and fill the gap rows' overlapping columns with the preceding color (replacing bg or proto).
 * Subtlety: Sections are only rows with some (but not all) proto cells; pure bg or pure proto rows are skipped. Inner rows for gap bridging are the first non-proto/non-bg row in a section.
 * Easy to miss: Chain adjacency is symmetric in detection but asymmetric in fill (uses preceding color); same-color regions don't need chain check. Fills shouldn't overwrite existing colors or cross proto walls. No diagonal propagation. Chain may have duplicates or gaps.
 * Across attempts: Bg detection fails if top rows have mixed colors (e.g., training 1 overfills with 8 in places expected to bridge). Vertical propagation doesn't handle multi-section overlaps correctly. Gap bridging assumes single inner row per section but may need multi-row consensus. Horizontal bridging in rows doesn't always trigger if segments aren't uniform.
 * Test input considerations: Assuming similar structure (top empty-ish, mid sections with colors/walls, bottom chain row), fills should propagate within walled blobs (e.g., uniform 4's, 9's) and bridge via chain (e.g., if chain allows 4-8 adjacency, fill between them with preceding). Proto=1 acts as borders, not fillable.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def detect_bg(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int, n: int, m: int) -> int:
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(m):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != proto:
                count[c] += 1
    if count:
        return max(count, key=count.get)
    return grid[n - 1][0] if n > 0 and m > 0 else 0
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode non-proto in upper grid; helpful for distinguishing empty space.)

```python
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(Extracts the adjacency legend from row n-2; essential for all bridging logic.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(Core rule for bridging: checks chain adjacency and returns preceding color for fill; symmetric detection but directed fill.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(Identifies wall-bounded sections for vertical propagation; helpful but buggy—excludes bottom rows and may misalign if sections touch chain row.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core bugs in propagation and bridging.
 * Training 1: Generated overfilled row 5 and 6 with 8's instead of expected 2's and 6's in columns 2-3 and 15-16; also filled row 12 with 8's in columns 8-10 where expected 9's; bottom sections like row 13 misplaced 9's to row 12. What worked: Correctly detected bg=8 and chain (implicitly [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]); horizontal fills in rows 1-4 and 8-11 matched expected 1-blobs and inner colors. What didn't: Vertical propagation missed bridging gaps (e.g., rows 5-7 should bridge upper 1-regions to lower via chain?); gap fill between sections overwrote with 8 or skipped (e.g., rows 5-7 expected partial 2/6 from chain adjacency).
 * Training 2: Generated filled row 1 columns 4/14 with 2/5 instead of 8 (bg); row 4 all 8's but expected partial 3/6/7 in columns 6/10/14. What worked: Chain extraction likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9]; some horizontal fills in rows 1-3/5-7 matched (e.g., 1-blobs around 2/5/7). What didn't: Bg detection may have erred (filled non-bg areas); vertical propagation in sections didn't fill row 4 gaps correctly (expected isolated colors from chain?); no bridging between upper/lower sections, leaving row 4 empty-ish.
 * Training 3: Generated duplicated row 1-5 fills into row 5 (extra 3/2 blobs); row 6 all 8's but expected empty; row 7 empty but expected 9 in col 19; rows 13-17 all 8's but expected 6 in col 11; row 18-22 partial but missed 8-fills around 1's. What worked: Section detection caught upper/mid blobs (rows 1-5/7-12/18-22); horizontal fills in row 3 matched 3/2/9. What didn't: Vertical propagation over-duplicated fills across sections; gap bridging between rows 5-7 and 12-13 failed (e.g., row 6/7/13-17 should bridge via chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] but filled wrong or skipped); chain adjacency not applied to isolated bottom colors.
 * Overall: Horizontal_fill works for intra-row uniform segments but fails bridging if segments aren't single-color or chain check misses order. Vertical_propagate_within is helpful for column fills but limited to sections (misses cross-section). Gap fill logic in program() assumes single inner row and overwrites proto incorrectly; doesn't handle non-overlapping regions. find_sections skips bottom (good, preserves chain) but may cut sections early. No extraction of "objects" (blobs) function, but get_filled_regions acts as one for rows—extend to 2D blobs? get_inner finds section reps but picks first non-empty row, which may not represent (e.g., if varying heights).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on training patterns and inferred rules; it over-propagates uniform fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4's in cols 1-5, rows 8-13 all 6's in cols 0-4, but likely input had partial seeds—fills should stop at walls/proto=1 and only bridge via chain, not blanket entire sections). Rows 14-15 have mixed 6/4 but row 16 jumps to 9/4/5/3 without clear vertical propagation; rows 21-25 uniform 7's suggest missed gap bridging (expected partial from chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 9-5). Bottom row 27 has isolated colors (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) matching chain pattern, but row 28 all 1's (bg?) should be empty/preserved. Differences: Too many full-block fills (e.g., 9's in rows 15-20 cols 20-24) without respecting potential wall gaps; no evident chain-based bridging (e.g., if chain is [4,8,9,7,6,4,5,3,7], why no preceding fills between 4-8 or 9-5?). Likely bg=1 here (all borders 1), but program assumed 8—mismatch causes wrong detection. Output ignores subtle section gaps (e.g., rows 6-7/13-14/20-21 all partial 1's or 9's, expected bridged colors). To fix: Adjust bg detection for 1-borders; add 2D blob extraction for better region matching; ensure gap fills only in overlapping cols with chain-preceding color.

[2025-09-30 21:46:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1). The filling propagates colors from the chain into background areas, but only where components are adjacent in the chain and connect properly through the grid's outlined shapes, without overfilling or ignoring vertical extensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is consistently the dominant filler (e.g., 8 in training examples 1 and 2, 1 in example 3 and test), identified from the bottom-left of the last row; all empty spaces start as bg.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row (n-2), filtering non-bg cells to form a sequence of colors that serves as a key for filling; positions in the chain matter for adjacency (e.g., colors at positions differing by 1 are adjacent).
 * "Proto" is the outline color (e.g., 1), found in rows above the chain by identifying rows with exactly one non-bg color; this acts as a boundary or connector, and fillings should not overwrite proto but can bridge through gaps in proto-outlined regions.
 * Components in each row (i < n-2) are contiguous non-bg segments; for each row, identify sub-components (groups of same-color cells), excluding bg and proto, and assign a primary color (proto if no other, or the dominant non-proto/bg color).
 * Filling occurs only between adjacent components in the same row if their colors are adjacent in the chain (checked via position proximity in chain, e.g., any pair of positions abs(diff)==1); gaps are filled with the chain's color at the minimal position of the adjacent pair.
 * Subtlety: Filling is horizontal within rows but must account for vertical propagation or extension from the chain upwards, especially into all-bg areas directly above chain positions (e.g., creating vertical blobs like 2x3 in train1 rows 6-7); the current program only fills horizontally and skips proto-adjacent cases, missing these verticals.
 * Do not fill if either component involves proto (current skip condition is too broad: "if comps[k][2] == proto or comps[k + 1][2] == proto: continue"), which prevents necessary bridging.
 * Chain adjacency check uses all positions of a color (pos1 + pos2), finding min_p for fill color, but fails if colors appear multiple times non-adjacently; this works for simple cases but misses multi-occurrence logic.
 * Grids have varying widths (20 in train1/2, 27 in train3, 29 in test); ensure m = len(grid[0]) handles this.
 * Outlined shapes (e.g., 1's forming boundaries around inner colors like 2,3,4) suggest enclosed regions that should be filled consistently with chain colors, but only where connected vertically/horizontally without crossing outlines.
 * Last two rows are fixed (chain in n-2, bg in n-1); processing only affects rows 0 to n-3.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical stacking of fillings (e.g., expected train1 has 3-row vertical 2's and 6's in rows 6-8, but generated has none); program doesn't propagate upwards iteratively.
 * No diagonal connections; only orthogonal (horizontal in row, vertical implied by chain position).
 * Colors 2-9 are fillers; 1/8 often bg or proto, but bg varies per grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    return [grid[n-2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n-2][j] != bg]

# Helpful inline snippet: Find proto (outline color)
def find_proto(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> int:
    for row in grid[:-2]:
        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:
    non_bg_pos = [j for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] != bg]
    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where regions bounded by prototype walls (1) and background (typically 8) are filled with colors (2-9) by propagating single-color dominance within segments, vertically within wall-defined sections, and horizontally/vertically across section gaps if colors are adjacent in a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row; the goal is to complete the grid without overfilling or misapplying rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows (0 to n-3), but only if present; empty grids return unchanged.
 * Chain extraction takes the second-last row (n-2), filtering out bg and proto to get a sequence of colors that defines "adjacency" for filling (e.g., if a and b are neighbors in chain, the preceding color can fill gaps between regions of a and b).
 * Horizontal filling occurs in every upper row (0 to n-3): between proto walls, if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, between adjacent filled segments with colors a and b, if they are adjacent in chain, fill the proto/bg gap with the preceding color from the adjacency.
 * Sections are contiguous blocks of rows (from 0 to n-3) that contain some (but not all) proto cells; these define vertical propagation zones.
 * Vertical propagation within a section: for each column, between proto cells, if the non-bg/non-proto cells in the vertical segment have exactly one color, fill bg cells in that segment with it.
 * Inter-section filling: between consecutive sections, for gap rows, if inner rows of sections have horizontally overlapping filled regions with colors a and b that are adjacent in chain, fill the entire overlapping vertical/horizontal gap area with the preceding color—but only if regions overlap horizontally (max start <= min end +1).
 * Subtlety: get_inner picks the first non-bg/non-proto row in a section as representative for region extraction; this assumes sections have consistent inner structure but can miss if sections have varying filled rows.
 * Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the preceding color (first in the pair), and same colors return themselves; no filling if no adjacency.
 * Proto (1) acts as walls/barriers; bg is never propagated as a color.
 * Edge cases: empty segments, all-proto rows (skipped), no chain (no inter-fills), sections touching (no gap), or non-overlapping regions (no cross-fill).
 * The bottom two rows (n-2 and n-1) are typically the chain and a fixed bottom bar; they are not processed for filling.
 * Overfilling risk: horizontal fill runs before sections, so it can create filled regions used in vertical/inter steps; but vertical only within sections, not across.
 * Assumption: grids are rectangular, colors 1-9, bg dominant in empties.

```
(Performs horizontal segment filling and gap filling within a row; key for initial color spread.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture: horizontal and vertical propagation work partially, but inter-section gap filling and section detection miss cases.
 * Train 1: Generated filled upper sections correctly (e.g., 1-2-5-7 blocks in rows 1-4), but failed to fill gap between sections 0-4 and 8-11 (expected 2 in cols 2-3 rows 5-7, 6 in cols 15-16 rows 5-7; generated all 8s); also overfilled row 12 with 9s in cols 8-9 (expected 8s), and misplaced 9s in row 12; bottom chain row 18 has correct sequence but no propagation upward.
 * Train 1: get_inner selected row 8 for second section, but expected fillings suggest propagation from row 9-11; horizontal_fill didn't bridge non-adjacent chain pairs (e.g., 2 and 6 not adjacent in chain [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]).
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled some bg with 1 or 2 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 4=2 but expected 8; row 4 cols 6=3 but expected 8 in a proto-heavy area); missed vertical propagation in section 4-7 (expected isolated 3,6,7 in row 4 cols 6,10,14 but generated 8s); sections misdetected, leading to no gap fill between upper and lower blocks.
 * Train 2: Chain likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] from row 11, but is_adjacent_preceding not applied correctly for cross-section (e.g., no fill for 3-6-7 isolation); horizontal_fill filled some segments but skipped gaps due to multi-color or non-adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated upper sections (rows 1-5 all filled similarly, but expected varied with 8s in some proto areas); missed vertical fills in lower sections (e.g., rows 13-17 expected 6 in col 11, but generated 8s; rows 17-21 expected isolated 8s but filled with 1s erroneously); inter-section gap (rows 6-7 and 12) not filled (expected 9 in row 6 col 19, 6 in rows 13-17 col 11).
 * Train 3: Larger grid (27 cols) exposed section detection bug—find_sections skipped some partial-proto rows (e.g., row 20 has partial but treated as full bg); vertical_propagate_within overfilled 1s into bg areas; chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] not used for gaps between multi-section blocks.
 * Overall: horizontal_fill works for single-color segments but fails gap fills if chain order wrong or segments not adjacent; vertical_propagate_within skips multi-color verticals correctly but doesn't handle section edges; inter-section logic in program() buggy—get_filled_regions uses inner row only, missing if inner has no fills yet, and overlap check (max(st1,st2) <= min(en1,en2)+1) too strict, preventing non-exact overlaps; no iteration (fills don't propagate after initial horizontal).
 * Function vertical_propagate_within is helpful but limited to sections—extend to full columns? But no, rules confine to sections.
 * Function get_filled_regions is similar to horizontal_fill logic but extracts only—useful but redundant if run after fills.
 * Function get_inner assumes first non-empty row, but if sections have bg-only inners initially, returns None and skips fills (bug in trains).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows uniform block fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4s in cols 1-5, 8s in 8-12; rows 8-13 6s/7s/4s) suggesting horizontal_fill worked for large segments, but vertical propagation seems absent or incomplete (e.g., no blending between row blocks 6-7 and 8-14, which should be sections separated by all-1 rows); inter-section gaps (rows 7,14,21) remain all 1s (proto?), but expected would fill based on chain adjacency if blocks like 4-8-9 adjacent.
 * Test output over-relies on horizontal: entire rows filled uniformly without vertical consistency (e.g., row 15-20 has 9-4-5-3 blocks, but no upward propagation from chain row 27 [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] into gaps); chain includes 1s (proto?), which shouldn't be in chain—extract_chain filters them, but output suggests misdetection (bg=1? but 1 is proto, detect_bg skips proto so bg likely another).
 * Test output misses subtle overlaps: e.g., if sections at rows 0-6 (4/8/9) and 8-13 (6/7/4), gap row 7 should fill where 4 and 6 adjacent in chain (preceding color), but remains 1s; similarly, lower sections not bridged (e.g., 9 and 4 in rows 15-20 and 22-26 should fill row 21 if adjacent).
 * Bg detection likely wrong—upper rows have 1s (proto) and some colors, but if 1 dominates non-proto count? No, detect_bg counts non-proto, so bg= some color like 1? Wait, proto=1 skipped, so bg= most common other (but output fills with colors, not bg); output has 1s as walls but fills bg-spots with colors correctly in blocks, but no gap fills, suggesting inter-section logic broken for large grids (29 cols).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for intra-section fills but ignores chain-based bridging, leaving gaps unfilled—does not match expected full completion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where regions of colored cells (numbers 2-9) are partially filled, separated by prototype walls (1's) and background (typically 8's or similar empty spaces), and the goal is to propagate and fill the background spaces with appropriate colors based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a specific row (often the second-to-last row, excluding backgrounds and prototypes). The filling follows horizontal and vertical propagation within sections bounded by prototypes, and bridging gaps between sections using chain-based color matching, ultimately producing a completed grid that matches expected patterns without overfilling or misapplying colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototypes (proto=1) act as walls or dividers that bound sections; they should not be overwritten, and filling stops at them.
 * Background (bg, often 8) is the empty space to fill; detection of bg is crucial and should be the most common non-proto color in early rows (code uses rows 0 to n-3).
 * The chain is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, which serves as a reference for "adjacent preceding" color rules—e.g., if two colors A and B are adjacent in the chain (in either order), a fill color C can bridge them if C precedes them adjacently in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling occurs within rows, filling bg gaps between proto walls if the segment has a single dominant color, and bridging adjacent segments if their colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Vertical propagation fills bg within column segments bounded by proto in a section, using the single color if present.
 * Sections are contiguous row groups (from 0 to n-3) that contain some but not all proto in a row; gaps between sections (rows with all bg or all proto?) are bridged vertically by finding overlapping horizontal regions in "inner" rows of adjacent sections and filling the gap rows with chain-derived colors where overlaps match.
 * Subtlety: "Inner" rows for bridging are the first non-proto/bg row in a section; if none, skip. Overlaps are horizontal position-based (max start to min end).
 * Chain adjacency check (is_adjacent_preceding) returns the preceding color if A and B are neighbors in chain, but only if they match exactly (order flexible); if A==B, return A. This is used for bridging but may fail if chain order matters directionally (unobserved).
 * Gaps between sections only fill where upper and lower regions overlap horizontally; non-overlapping areas stay bg.
 * Easy to miss: Full-row bg or proto rows (like rows n-1 and n-2 in some examples) are not processed for sections or chain if excluded; chain is strictly from row n-2 non-bg/proto cells.
 * Another subtlety: In vertical propagation, collect colors in a column segment excluding bg/proto, and fill only if exactly one unique color; multi-color segments don't fill.
 * Horizontal fill first applies to all rows 0 to n-3, then vertical within sections, then inter-section bridging—order matters to avoid overfilling.
 * Bg detection scans only early rows (0 to n-3), assuming later rows are chain/reserved; if grid has varying bg, this fails.
 * In examples, some expected fillings create vertical stacks (e.g., 2's and 6's in gaps) that span multiple rows, suggesting bridging applies to entire gap height.
 * Proto rows can be partial; sections end when a row is all proto or no proto.
 * Chain may have duplicates or orders that imply directionality (e.g., 2 before 3 allows filling with 2 between 3-regions? But code returns preceding, which may be wrong).
 * Test inputs may have different bg (e.g., 1 as bg?) or wider grids, requiring robust detection.
 * Unobserved: Some expected outputs leave certain bg unfilled if no chain match, or fill with specific colors from chain positions.

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `get_inner`: Attempts to find first non-bg/proto row in section for bridging reference, but in examples, it picks rows that lead to wrong overlaps (e.g., picks filled rows, causing no bridging).
- `get_filled_regions`: Extracts single-color segments between proto in a row, but when used for bridging, it fails to align upper/lower overlaps correctly, leading to no fills in gaps.
- Overall program structure: Applies horizontal fill to all rows first (good), vertical within sections (partial), but inter-section bridging is flawed—wrong inner row selection and overlap logic miss vertical stacks in gaps.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects bg=8 and extracts chain (e.g., in Train 1: [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5,...]), and applies some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., fills single-color segments like 7's in Train 1 row 2).
 * Horizontal fill works partially: In Train 1, it correctly fills some bg to match colors within segments (e.g., row 1 fills 1's), but overfills bridges incorrectly (e.g., fills 7's where expected has 8's in row 1 cols 11-13).
 * Vertical propagation works in simple cases but misses in complex sections: In Train 1, it fills some but leaves gaps unfilled vertically.
 * Section finding identifies partial-proto row groups correctly (e.g., Train 1 sections at rows 1-4 and 8-11), but bridging between sections fails entirely—no fills in gap rows 5-7 and 12-13, where expected has vertical 2's (cols 2-3) and 6's (cols 16-17) based on chain adjacency (e.g., 2 precedes 1? Chain links needed).
 * In Train 1 generated vs expected: Rows 1 differs (generated fills 7's in cols 11-13 and 1's in 14-17; expected has 8's in 11-13); rows 5-7 all 8's in generated but expected has 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17 across 3 rows; row 12 all 8's but expected has 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; row 13 differs (generated has 1's/4's/2's but expected has 1's/8's). Reason unknown but likely wrong overlap detection in bridging.
 * In Train 2 generated vs expected: Minimal filling (many 8's stay); row 1 has extra 2 in col 4 (generated) vs 8 expected; rows 4-5 all 8's but expected row 4 has 3/6/7 isolated; no bridging fills vertical gaps (e.g., expected row 4 has scattered colors, but generated leaves empty). Chain [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] not used for bridging.
 * In Train 3 generated vs expected: Fills some horizontals (e.g., row 1 3's and 2's match), but verticals overfill (e.g., rows 4-5 duplicate row 1 fills incorrectly); sections found but bridging misses (rows 6 empty, expected has 9 in col 19; rows 12-16 all 8's but expected has 6's in col 11 across 5 rows); rows 17-22 have partial 1's but expected has 8's in many places and 9/7 isolated. Overpropagation in vertical func likely.
 * extract_chain is essential and correct for adjacency rules.
 * horizontal_fill is partially helpful but bridges too aggressively without checking chain direction.
 * vertical_propagate_within is useful but skips multi-color segments correctly—issue is in section bounds.
 * find_sections works but excludes gap rows properly.
 * is_adjacent_preceding may be broken: Returns preceding (left) in chain, but expected bridges might need the common predecessor or something else (unknown why gaps like 2's in Train 1).
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are incorrect for bridging: Wrong row selection (e.g., picks bottom of section) and overlap calc misses vertical extension to full gap height.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of sections and chain but fails bridging logic, leading to empty gaps where expected has stacked colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massively with 1's (likely misdetected as bg or proto), creating solid rows of 1's (e.g., row 0 all 1's, row 26 all 1's) where expected likely has structured regions and bg preserved in non-fill areas.
 * It applies some block fills (e.g., 4's in rows 1-6 cols 1-5, 9's in rows 1-6 cols 20-24, 6's in rows 8-14 cols 1-5), which may match intra-section propagation, but chain-based bridging seems absent (e.g., row 14 has 4's but no connection to upper/lower; rows 15-16 have mixed but overfilled with 1's in non-region spots).
 * Gaps like between rows 6-7 (all 1's/9's but mismatched) and rows 20-25 (7's but bordered by 1's) suggest failed section detection or bg=1 misfill, leaving no empty spaces and ignoring chain (unseen, but likely [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] from row 27).
 * This doesn't make sense as a completed puzzle—too uniform with 1's everywhere outside blocks, unlike training expecteds that preserve bg in non-connected areas and use chain for targeted fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where a partially colored canvas (with numbers 1-9 representing walls/proto=1 and colors, and 8 as background) must be completed by propagating and bridging colors horizontally and vertically, guided by a "chain" of allowed adjacent colors extracted from near the bottom row, ensuring fills respect wall boundaries and only use colors that are sequential in the chain for bridging gaps between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg=8) is the most common non-proto color in the top n-2 rows; it must be distinguished from actual colors (2-9) to avoid over-filling.
 * The chain is extracted from row n-2 (second-to-last row), including only non-bg, non-proto cells; this acts as a legend of sequential color adjacencies (e.g., if chain has ...A B..., A and B can bridge via fill with A if A precedes B).
 * Proto/walls (1) divide the grid into "sections" (consecutive rows with mixed proto and non-proto cells); vertical propagation fills bg within columns of a section only if a single non-bg/non-proto color dominates that column segment.
 * Horizontal fills occur row-by-row (for i in 0 to n-3): within a row, uniform-color segments (bounded by proto) get bg filled to match; adjacent segments bridge bg/proto gaps only if their colors are adjacent in the chain, filling with the preceding color in the pair.
 * Gaps between sections (rows between end of one section and start of next) are bridged vertically in overlapping column ranges: find uniform regions in "inner" rows of adjacent sections, check chain adjacency, and fill the gap rows' overlapping columns with the preceding color (replacing bg or proto).
 * Subtlety: Sections are only rows with some (but not all) proto cells; pure bg or pure proto rows are skipped. Inner rows for gap bridging are the first non-proto/non-bg row in a section.
 * Easy to miss: Chain adjacency is symmetric in detection but asymmetric in fill (uses preceding color); same-color regions don't need chain check. Fills shouldn't overwrite existing colors or cross proto walls. No diagonal propagation. Chain may have duplicates or gaps.
 * Across attempts: Bg detection fails if top rows have mixed colors (e.g., training 1 overfills with 8 in places expected to bridge). Vertical propagation doesn't handle multi-section overlaps correctly. Gap bridging assumes single inner row per section but may need multi-row consensus. Horizontal bridging in rows doesn't always trigger if segments aren't uniform.
 * Test input considerations: Assuming similar structure (top empty-ish, mid sections with colors/walls, bottom chain row), fills should propagate within walled blobs (e.g., uniform 4's, 9's) and bridge via chain (e.g., if chain allows 4-8 adjacency, fill between them with preceding). Proto=1 acts as borders, not fillable.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def detect_bg(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int, n: int, m: int) -> int:
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(m):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != proto:
                count[c] += 1
    if count:
        return max(count, key=count.get)
    return grid[n - 1][0] if n > 0 and m > 0 else 0
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode non-proto in upper grid; helpful for distinguishing empty space.)

```python
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(Extracts the adjacency legend from row n-2; essential for all bridging logic.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(Core rule for bridging: checks chain adjacency and returns preceding color for fill; symmetric detection but directed fill.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(Identifies wall-bounded sections for vertical propagation; helpful but buggy—excludes bottom rows and may misalign if sections touch chain row.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core bugs in propagation and bridging.
 * Training 1: Generated overfilled row 5 and 6 with 8's instead of expected 2's and 6's in columns 2-3 and 15-16; also filled row 12 with 8's in columns 8-10 where expected 9's; bottom sections like row 13 misplaced 9's to row 12. What worked: Correctly detected bg=8 and chain (implicitly [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]); horizontal fills in rows 1-4 and 8-11 matched expected 1-blobs and inner colors. What didn't: Vertical propagation missed bridging gaps (e.g., rows 5-7 should bridge upper 1-regions to lower via chain?); gap fill between sections overwrote with 8 or skipped (e.g., rows 5-7 expected partial 2/6 from chain adjacency).
 * Training 2: Generated filled row 1 columns 4/14 with 2/5 instead of 8 (bg); row 4 all 8's but expected partial 3/6/7 in columns 6/10/14. What worked: Chain extraction likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9]; some horizontal fills in rows 1-3/5-7 matched (e.g., 1-blobs around 2/5/7). What didn't: Bg detection may have erred (filled non-bg areas); vertical propagation in sections didn't fill row 4 gaps correctly (expected isolated colors from chain?); no bridging between upper/lower sections, leaving row 4 empty-ish.
 * Training 3: Generated duplicated row 1-5 fills into row 5 (extra 3/2 blobs); row 6 all 8's but expected empty; row 7 empty but expected 9 in col 19; rows 13-17 all 8's but expected 6 in col 11; row 18-22 partial but missed 8-fills around 1's. What worked: Section detection caught upper/mid blobs (rows 1-5/7-12/18-22); horizontal fills in row 3 matched 3/2/9. What didn't: Vertical propagation over-duplicated fills across sections; gap bridging between rows 5-7 and 12-13 failed (e.g., row 6/7/13-17 should bridge via chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] but filled wrong or skipped); chain adjacency not applied to isolated bottom colors.
 * Overall: Horizontal_fill works for intra-row uniform segments but fails bridging if segments aren't single-color or chain check misses order. Vertical_propagate_within is helpful for column fills but limited to sections (misses cross-section). Gap fill logic in program() assumes single inner row and overwrites proto incorrectly; doesn't handle non-overlapping regions. find_sections skips bottom (good, preserves chain) but may cut sections early. No extraction of "objects" (blobs) function, but get_filled_regions acts as one for rows—extend to 2D blobs? get_inner finds section reps but picks first non-empty row, which may not represent (e.g., if varying heights).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on training patterns and inferred rules; it over-propagates uniform fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4's in cols 1-5, rows 8-13 all 6's in cols 0-4, but likely input had partial seeds—fills should stop at walls/proto=1 and only bridge via chain, not blanket entire sections). Rows 14-15 have mixed 6/4 but row 16 jumps to 9/4/5/3 without clear vertical propagation; rows 21-25 uniform 7's suggest missed gap bridging (expected partial from chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 9-5). Bottom row 27 has isolated colors (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) matching chain pattern, but row 28 all 1's (bg?) should be empty/preserved. Differences: Too many full-block fills (e.g., 9's in rows 15-20 cols 20-24) without respecting potential wall gaps; no evident chain-based bridging (e.g., if chain is [4,8,9,7,6,4,5,3,7], why no preceding fills between 4-8 or 9-5?). Likely bg=1 here (all borders 1), but program assumed 8—mismatch causes wrong detection. Output ignores subtle section gaps (e.g., rows 6-7/13-14/20-21 all partial 1's or 9's, expected bridged colors). To fix: Adjust bg detection for 1-borders; add 2D blob extraction for better region matching; ensure gap fills only in overlapping cols with chain-preceding color.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where numbers represent colors or barriers: 1 acts as walls/barriers (proto), 8 is typically background (bg), other numbers (2-9) are specific colors to propagate and fill into bg areas. The goal is to fill bg cells with appropriate colors based on connected uniform regions, vertical/horizontal propagation within wall-bounded sections, and gap-filling between sections using adjacency rules derived from a "chain" (likely a key sequence) extracted from near the bottom of the grid, ensuring shapes and separations match implied puzzle logic like nonograms or region-filling with constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into segments/regions both horizontally (within rows) and vertically (across rows); sections are defined as consecutive rows that contain some 1's but are not entirely 1's, and propagation must respect these boundaries without crossing full-1 rows or unrelated areas.
 * Background (bg, usually 8) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows; it must be filled only where a uniform color can be inferred from adjacent non-bg/non-proto cells, but never overwrite existing colors or 1's.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row, capturing non-bg/non-proto cells as a sequence of colors (e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in train1); this acts as an adjacency key—fills between regions use a color from the chain only if two adjacent regions' colors (a and b) appear next to each other in the chain, preferring the "preceding" one in the pair.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, segments between 1's (or edges) should be filled with a single color if all non-bg/non-proto cells in that segment share one color; bg cells in the segment get that color, but gaps between filled segments (still bg) get filled via chain if the bounding segments' colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a detected section (consecutive partial-1 rows), fill vertically column-by-column: if a vertical segment between 1's has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, propagate that color to all bg cells in that vertical run; do not cross 1's or section boundaries.
 * Gap filling between sections: For gaps (all-8 or partial rows) between two sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section), get their horizontal filled regions, and for overlapping column ranges between upper/lower regions with colors a/b, if a and b are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rectangle (overlapping columns, all gap rows) with the preceding color from the chain pair; only fill bg or 1's in those positions (but 1's might be subtle—avoid overwriting true walls?).
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency is bidirectional but returns the "preceding" color in the pair (e.g., if chain has ...a,b..., fill with a; if ...b,a..., fill with b); sections must exclude the last two rows (header/footer?); inner row selection picks the first row in a section with any non-1/bg, but if none, skip; do not fill if segment colors aren't uniform (len(seg_colors)==1); gaps only if gap_start <= gap_end; vertical propagation skips 1's but fills around them if uniform; chain extraction ignores bg and 1's but preserves order; in multi-row uniform blocks, ensure consistency across rows; bottom row (and possibly second-bottom) is the key and should remain unchanged; full-8 rows separate sections but aren't sections themselves; overlapping regions in gap-fill use max/min columns for projection.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal fill must happen before vertical/section detection (as in code), but gap-fill after; chain might have duplicates (e.g., two 2's in train1), so adjacency checks all pairs; if no uniform color, leave as bg; vertical fill only within section bounds, not across gaps; in train3, large sections need multi-row consistency; test grid has wider layout with more colors (3-9), so chain likely longer; do not fill the very top/bottom rows unless they fit section rules; bg detection scans only upper rows (n-2) to avoid key contamination.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding but incomplete implementation of propagation and gap-filling rules.
 * Horizontal filling worked partially: In train1, upper sections (rows 1-4) correctly filled uniform 1/2/5/7 segments between 1's, but failed to fill intra-row gaps between segments (e.g., row1 generated 1's but left 7/8 areas as 8's instead of using chain); similar in train2 (filled some 1/2/3/5/7 but left row1's 2-block incomplete) and train3 (filled multi-row 1/3/2/9 blocks but missed vertical consistency in lower sections).
 * Vertical propagation worked somewhat: In train1, it extended colors within sections (e.g., 2's and 5's in rows 2-3), but skipped or failed in wider blocks; in train2, filled rows5-7 correctly for 1/4/6/9 but not row4 gaps; in train3, extended upper 1/3/2 blocks across rows1-5 but left lower sections (rows8-11) with incomplete 4/6 fills (e.g., row9 has 6 but not propagated fully).
 * Section detection worked basically: Correctly identified partial-1 row groups (e.g., train1 sections at rows0-4 and 8-11; train2 at 0-2 and 5-7; train3 at 0-5 and 8-11 and 17-21), excluding full-8 and last two rows, but <n-2 limit missed some lower sections in train3 (e.g., rows17-21 detected but propagation incomplete).
 * Gap filling failed entirely: No fills in inter-section gaps; e.g., train1 generated all-8 rows5-7 where expected has 2/6 blocks (projected from upper/lower), and row12 all-8 vs expected 9/2; train2 row4 all-8 vs expected 3/6/7 blocks; train3 row6-7 and row12-16 all-8 vs expected 9/6 blocks—likely because get_inner returned valid rows but overlap checks (o_l > o_r) or chain adjacency failed (e.g., wrong preceding color or no match); also, perform_gap_fills skipped if no inner or gap too small.
 * Chain extraction worked: For train1, likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] matching bottom; used in horizontal but not effectively in gaps (e.g., 2 and 6 should fill with preceding if adjacent in chain, but didn't).
 * Bg detection worked: 8 correctly identified in all.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: perform_gap_fills is broken (no fills occur, possibly due to strict overlap or fill_c None; overwrites proto=1 in gaps? but shouldn't); get_filled_regions misses non-uniform post-fill; vertical_propagate_within skips too aggressively (leaves bg in multi-color verticals, but examples need uniform check); overall program modifies grid_out in-place but doesn't handle multi-section gaps or chain duplicates well; no function for full-grid uniformity check post-fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete propagation and missing gap fills similar to training failures; e.g., rows1-6 have 4's and 8's filled horizontally but no vertical extension to row6's partial 9's, and row7-8 all 1's (possibly misbg?) where gaps should project colors like 9's from above; rows8-12 fill 6/7/4 but row13 cuts 4's short (ends with 1's instead of full block), suggesting horizontal_fill failed end-segment; row15 has 9/5/3 blocks but row16 all 1's (gap unfilled, should project from row15 to row20's 3/7?); rows21-25 fill 3 then 7's but inconsistently (row21 3's full, rows22-26 7's but row26 all 1's?); bottom key row27 has 4/8/9/etc. unchanged (good), but overall lacks vertical consistency in lower half (e.g., 5/3/7 blocks not propagated up from key projections) and gap rectangles (e.g., between row12 and row14, no 4/5/3 fills); compared to training patterns, it over-relies on horizontal (matches upper 4/8/9 shapes) but misses chain-based gap/vertical for lower (e.g., expected likely has 7's extending up from row22 into row16 gap, using chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 5-7); without expected, it differs by leaving too many 1's/bg in gaps/verticals, making shapes incomplete (e.g., 4-block in row13-14 not uniform height).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where a 2D grid represents a visual scene with background cells (typically 8), wall/prototype cells (1), and partial colored regions (numbers 2-9). The goal is to propagate and fill background cells with colors based on uniformity in rows/columns, adjacency rules from a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row, and rules for filling gaps between vertically separated "sections" of the grid defined by partial wall rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg, usually 8) cells must only be filled if they can be unambiguously propagated from adjacent uniform colored segments; never overwrite existing colors, walls (proto=1), or other non-bg cells.
 * The "chain" is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, used to determine if two colors are "adjacent" (i.e., appear next to each other in the chain, in either order) for gap-filling; if so, the preceding color in the chain can fill gaps between matching segments.
 * Sections are contiguous groups of rows (up to n-2) that contain at least one proto=1 but are not entirely proto=1; these define bounded areas for vertical propagation.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, identify segments between proto walls; if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, for adjacent segments, if their colors are adjacent in the chain, fill bg gaps between them with the preceding color from the chain pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section and per column, fill bg cells in stretches between proto walls using the single uniform color in that stretch if present.
 * Inter-section filling: Between consecutive sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-proto/bg row in each section), extract uniform colored regions from those rows, find overlapping column ranges between upper and lower regions, and if the colors are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rows (between sections) in those columns with the preceding chain color—but only if both sections have valid inner rows.
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency checks must consider order (preceding color matters, not just presence); sections exclude the last two rows (n-1 and n-2 are reserved for chain/bottom); bg detection counts non-proto in upper rows (0 to n-3) to find the most common non-proto as bg; do not fill if segments have multiple colors; gap filling between sections only applies to bg cells and only in overlapping columns; empty sections or no inner row skips filling; chain may have duplicates or gaps, but adjacency is pairwise consecutive only.
 * Edge cases: All-proto rows end sections; no sections means no vertical/inter-section filling; chain may be empty (no gap filling); varying grid widths (m) and heights (n); test inputs may have larger/more complex sections; bottom two rows (including chain row) are never modified; proto=1 is fixed and blocks propagation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Horizontal filling often works for intra-row uniformity but fails on chain-based gap filling if is_adjacent_preceding returns wrong preceding color; vertical propagation misses if sections are misidentified (e.g., including all-proto rows); inter-section filling fails if inner rows are not correctly selected (e.g., picking a row with no non-bg cells) or if overlap detection ignores partial overlaps; bg detection assumes upper rows, but if grid is small (n<3), chain/extractions return empty; no handling for multiple chains or non-standard proto/bg; fillings can cascade (horizontal then vertical then inter-section), so order matters.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it implements a full pipeline (bg detection, chain extraction, horizontal/vertical filling, section-based inter-filling) showing partial understanding of propagation rules.
 * Horizontal filling works correctly for uniform segments in rows (e.g., fills 1-regions around 2/5/7 in ex1 rows 2-3) but fails chain-based gaps (e.g., doesn't fill between 7 and 1 in ex1 row1 correctly, leaving extra 1's unfilled? Wait, actually overfills some 7's into bg areas).
 * Vertical propagation succeeds in sections for uniform columns (e.g., fills 5's vertically in ex1) but misses if sections are wrong (e.g., in ex3, doesn't fill lower vertical stacks like 6's in rows 13-17).
 * Section finding is mostly correct (identifies partial-wall groups) but excludes last two rows properly; however, inter-section gap filling fails entirely—e.g., in ex1, gaps between sections (rows 5-7) remain all bg instead of filling 2's and 6's based on chain adjacency from upper/lower inners; similarly, row12 gap unfilled for 9's/2's.
 * In ex2, horizontal fills some (e.g., 2/5/7 in row2) but misses vertical in sections and all inter-section (row4 remains bg, expected 3/6/7); chain extraction works but not applied between sections.
 * In ex3, fills upper sections horizontally/vertically (e.g., 3/2 in rows1-4) but misses many lower fillings (e.g., rows7-12 partial, rows13-17 all bg instead of 6's, rows18-22 unfilled 1-regions); inter-section skips due to no inner or overlap issues.
 * Bg detection works (identifies 8 correctly); chain extraction is accurate but underused (adjacency only for horizontal, not fully for vertical/gaps).
 * Overall, intra-section filling (horizontal/vertical) partially succeeds (~50% in ex1/3), but inter-section logic broken (no gap fills observed); no overfilling of proto or bottom rows, but underfilling dominates.
 * Function `get_inner` is helpful but fragile (returns first non-proto/bg row, but if none, skips—happens in ex1 row12?); `get_filled_regions` good for extracting uniform segments but only used post-horizontal, so misses if horizontal incomplete.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `horizontal_fill` has redundant comps building (could fill in one pass); entire inter-section loop assumes consecutive sections only and max/min overlap, but doesn't handle non-overlapping or multi-region overlaps well (e.g., ex3 complex widths).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows large uniform blocks filled (e.g., rows1-5 all 4's in cols1-5, 8's in cols8-12, 9's in cols20-24; rows8-12 6's/7's/4's; rows15-19 9's/4's/5's/3's; rows21-25 7's), with horizontal propagation seeming applied but vertical/inter-section incomplete (e.g., rows6-7 and13-14 all 1's suggest no gap filling between sections; bottom row28 has scattered colors but row27 all 1's unfilled).
 * It matches a pattern of filling wide uniform regions but leaves potential section gaps as 1's (which may be proto, but expected likely fills bg=1? Wait, test uses 1 as bg/proto? Confusion: test grid has 1 as bg/proto, differing from training's 8/1—program hardcodes proto=1, detects bg=1? But output fills over 1's incorrectly, e.g., row1 all 1's unfilled but should propagate if sections present.
 * Differences: Overfills entire blocks without wall respect (e.g., rows1-5 ignore potential proto in input); misses vertical uniformity (e.g., col1 all 1's/4's/6's/9's but not propagated down sections); chain-based gaps not filled (e.g., between row5-6 and row12-13, remains 1's); bottom row28 has 4/8/9/... but no propagation to row27; overall, looks like horizontal-only filling on assumed input sections, ignoring inter-section rules—does not match expected full propagation seen in training diffs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling of background areas (likely 8 in training examples, 1 in test) using rules based on "prototype" walls (fixed as 1), sections of rows with partial walls, and a "chain" of colors extracted from near the bottom row to determine valid adjacencies for filling gaps horizontally, vertically within sections, and between sections. The goal is to fill unknown/background cells with colors that maintain connectivity and adjacency rules derived from the chain, without overfilling or violating section boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (proto=1) acts as walls that divide rows into segments; sections are groups of consecutive rows (excluding top 2 and bottom 2?) that contain some but not all 1's, used for vertical propagation.
 * Background (bg) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in the top rows (excluding last 2); in training it's 8, but test uses 1 as apparent bg/walls interchangeably, suggesting code's fixed proto=1 may not generalize if inputs vary.
 * Chain is extracted from the second-to-last row, keeping only non-bg non-proto cells; used to check "adjacent preceding" pairs (if a and b are neighbors in chain or swapped, return the first/preceding one as fill color).
 * Horizontal filling: Within rows, fill bg gaps between walls if the segment has exactly one color; then bridge gaps between filled segments using chain adjacency if colors match a valid pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section, for each column, fill bg in vertical runs bounded by walls if the run has exactly one non-bg color, but skip edges if at section boundaries.
 * Between sections: Identify "inner" rows (first non-proto non-bg row in section), get horizontal filled regions, find overlapping column ranges between upper/lower sections' regions, and fill bg in the gap rows between sections using chain adjacency of the region colors.
 * Subtlety: Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color (first in pair); if a==b, return a directly.
 * Easy to miss: Sections exclude rows that are all-proto or no-proto; filling only happens if exactly one color in segment (avoids mixing); vertical fill skips boundary rows in sections to avoid over-propagation; between-sections fill only in overlapping columns and only if adjacency exists.
 * Chain may have duplicates or order matters for "preceding"; no filling if no valid adjacency or no overlap.
 * Gaps between sections only filled if inner rows exist and regions align; entire grid copy to avoid mutating input.
 * Potential issue: Code assumes n>=3, fixed proto=1; may fail if bg==1 or variable protos; doesn't handle empty sections or single-row sections well.
 * All training examples have a bottom chain row (row 25) with isolated colors separated by bg, likely the key for adjacencies (e.g., 3,2,9,4,6,7).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the last (and only shown) submission; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating core horizontal filling, chain extraction, and basic vertical propagation work for simple cases without between-section gaps or complex overlaps.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated incorrectly filled row 2 with 3's in columns 6-8 (where expected has 8's/bg) and 2's in 14-16 (expected 8's); row 6 lacks the isolated 9 in column 19 (expected has it, generated has 1? but shown as 1's); rows 12-16 have all 8's in column 11 where expected has 6's (failed vertical propagation or section detection); row 7 has no 9, and lower sections missed 6's entirely—likely due to flawed between-sections filling or inner row selection not capturing isolated colors.
 * Horizontal_fill worked partially (filled 1's correctly in many places) but overfilled bridges using chain (e.g., 1-3 adjacency assumed but not valid, or chain order wrong).
 * Vertical_propagate_within seems broken for training 3: Didn't propagate 6's downward in column 11 across rows 12-16, possibly because sections weren't detected correctly or fill_start/end skipped too much.
 * Between-sections logic in main program failed: For gap around row 6-7, didn't place the 9; for lower gaps, missed propagating 6's—likely inner_u/inner_l selection wrong (get_inner returns first non-empty row, but may need all or different), or overlap detection (o_s/o_e) too strict, or no adjacency in chain for relevant pairs.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are helpful but subtle: get_inner picks first valid row, which may miss if sections have varying inner rows; get_filled_regions identifies uniform segments correctly but only if already horizontally filled.
 * find_sections likely missed sections in training 3 (e.g., rows with isolated protos not grouped), leading to no vertical fill for 6's.
 * Overall, code handles single-section or no-gap cases (training 1/2) but breaks on multi-section with isolated colors and gaps (training 3); chain adjacency may not handle non-consecutive pairs or duplicates well.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all shown are relevant, but vertical_propagate_within and between-sections loop need debugging for edge cases like single-cell regions or boundary skips.

**Test output:**
 * The test generated output appears mostly correct at a glance but has potential issues: It propagates colors like 2,4,8,9 horizontally/vertically within apparent sections (e.g., rows 1-5 have consistent blocks of 4's and 8's/9's), and bridges some using likely chain (e.g., row 15 has 2's extended to columns 14-18 and 20-24, suggesting adjacency fill); lower sections (rows 16-20) fill 9/4/5/3 blocks vertically across 3 rows, which matches vertical propagation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Row 8 is all 1's (bg?), but if it's a separator, expected might have partial fills; row 21 has 2's in 20-24 but input/generated shows consistent filling—unknown if overfills (e.g., row 15's middle 2's in 14-18/20-24 may bridge incorrectly if chain doesn't allow 2-2 self-adjacency across gap). Rows 22-25 have 7's propagated vertically but only in 20-24, and row 26 all 1's—seems correct, but row 27 (chain?) has isolated colors without filling around them, which matches rules (no fill in chain row).
 * Bottom row 28 all 1's expected; the isolated colors in row 27 (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) likely form the chain, and output didn't alter them, which is good—but upper fills (e.g., 6's in rows 9-12 columns 1-5) propagated down correctly, but row 15's 2's extension to column 14-18/20-24 might be wrong if no direct chain adjacency (unknown without input chain order).
 * Key difference: Test input (inferred from output patterns) has wider grid (29 cols?) with more sections; code filled most but possibly missed between-section gaps (e.g., rows 6-7/13-14 all 1's, no cross-fills shown); looks 80% correct but subtle overfills in row 15 suggest chain adjacency misapplied (e.g., self-adjacency for 2's allowed but maybe only for distinct pairs).
 * To handle test: Need to verify chain order matches bottom isolated (e.g., if chain is 4-8-9-... , then 2-4 adjacency might fill, but 2 self-bridge in gaps may be invalid); output makes sense overall but not perfect—account for larger m and more sections.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where background areas (bg) are filled with colors based on propagation rules within and between sections delimited by prototype walls (value 1), using horizontal filling of uniform segments, vertical propagation inside sections, and inter-section filling guided by overlapping colored regions and an adjacency chain extracted from near the bottom of the grid. The chain represents a sequence of colors that determines allowable fills between adjacent but separated colors (a and b can be bridged by a preceding color in the chain if they appear adjacent in it).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (1) acts as walls/barriers that segment the grid into sections; sections are identified by consecutive rows that contain some but not all 1s (mixed proto and non-proto).
 * Background (bg, often 0 or unfilled) is filled only if a segment/region has exactly one non-bg, non-proto color; multi-color segments are not filled.
 * Horizontal filling occurs first across all non-bottom rows, unifying bg in uniform-color gaps between 1s and bridging gaps between adjacent uniform segments if their colors are "adjacent" in the chain (i.e., appear next to each other in chain, filling with the preceding one).
 * Vertical propagation happens only within each section (between section start/end), filling bg in columns if the vertical segment in that column has exactly one color; it expands to cover the min-max range of that color's positions but skips over 1s.
 * Inter-section filling targets gaps between consecutive sections (rows from upper section end+1 to lower start-1), but only in columns where upper and lower "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section) have overlapping uniform colored regions; fill uses chain adjacency, and only bg is overwritten.
 * Chain extraction is from the second-to-last row (n-2), collecting non-bg, non-proto values in order, skipping 1s— this row often contains the "key" sequence of isolated colors separated by 1s.
 * Adjacency check in chain is symmetric (a then b or b then a) but returns the preceding color for filling; if a==b, use a directly.
 * Bottom two rows (n-1 and possibly n-2) are treated specially: n-1 is all 1s or bg, n-2 provides chain; no filling applied to bottom rows.
 * Subtle: "Inner" row for a section is the first row within it that has any non-1, non-bg; if none, skip inter-fill for that section pair.
 * Subtle: Overlap for inter-fill is strict (max start to min end of regions); no fill if no overlap or no chain link.
 * Edge cases: Empty sections, single-row sections, full-proto rows (not sections), grids with n<2 (return as-is), or chain with duplicates/self-adjacencies.
 * No overwriting of existing non-bg colors; only bg is filled. Sections must have mixed rows (some 1s but not all) to qualify—pure non-proto rows aren't sections for vertical prop.
 * Propagation doesn't cross sections vertically or use chain for intra-section fills; chain is only for horizontal bridges and inter-section gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(This extracts the color sequence from the penultimate row, ignoring bg and proto—essential for determining fill colors between adjacent regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(This checks chain for adjacency and returns the bridging color—core for all fill decisions; handles self-match directly.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    n = len(grid)
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as consecutive rows up to n-2 with partial proto coverage—key for scoping vertical and inter-fills; excludes bottom rows.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    # (as provided in attempt; fills uniform segments between protos with their single color, and bridges gaps between adjacent segments using chain)
```
(Helpful for initial horizontal unification across all rows.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    # (as provided; fills vertical bg segments within a section/column if single color present, expanding to min-max of that color)
```
(Helpful for intra-section vertical filling, but note it skips protos and only acts on bg.)

```python
def get_inner(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # (as provided; finds first row in section with any non-proto non-bg for inter-section reference)
```
(Helpful for selecting representative rows for overlap in inter-fills.)

```python
def get_filled_regions(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # (as provided; extracts uniform single-color segments between protos in a row, ignoring bg)
```
(Helpful for identifying regions in inner rows for overlap checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, indicating solid implementation of horizontal filling, section detection, vertical propagation within sections, and basic inter-section filling via chain.
 * What worked: Chain extraction accurately pulls the key sequence; horizontal_fill unifies bg in uniform gaps and bridges via chain adjacency; vertical_propagate_within properly scopes to sections and fills single-color verticals without crossing walls; section finding skips bottom rows and pure rows correctly.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, large areas are over-filled with 2 (likely from chain having many 2s or self-adjacency), but isolated higher numbers (e.g., 4,8,9 in rows 3,10,17) are preserved as "seeds" without surrounding fills, suggesting incomplete propagation around them—expected more bridging if chain allows (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 4 in chain, gaps near 4 should fill with preceding color, but appear as bg or unfilled in output? Wait, output shows 2s around them, but perhaps not vertically between sections).
 * Missed potential: Inter-section filling seems limited; in test output, the lower section (rows ~20-25) has 2s only on the right, with left all 1s, but if overlaps exist with upper sections' inner rows (which have scattered 4,8,etc.), more fills expected in gaps (rows 11-16? appear all 2s, but row 17 has mixed—perhaps sections misidentified).
 * extract_chain is essential and correct (pulls from n-2, which in test output became [1,4,1,8,...] after fills? No, chain extracted before fills, so from input's n-2).
 * horizontal_fill is helpful but may over-apply bridges if chain has long 2-2 sequences, leading to uniform 2 floods.
 * vertical_propagate_within is mostly correct but in test, columns with mixed seeds (e.g., col 3 has 4 in row3, 6 in row10, 9 in row17) aren't unified vertically across sections, which is intended (only within), but gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) remain 2-filled horizontally, potentially correct if no overlap trigger.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are essential for inter-fills but may fail if inner row is all bg after horizontal (test output has inner rows with seeds like row3, so okay); however, overlaps might be too narrow, missing wider fills.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though find_sections excludes i >= n-2 strictly, which is good but subtle if input has proto in bottom.

**Test output:**
 * The test output fills most of the grid with 2s in large horizontal bands (e.g., rows 1-2,4-9,11-16,18-20,22-23,25-26), preserving isolated higher colors (4,8,9 in row3; 6,7,4 in row10; 9,4,2,5,3 in row17; 7 in row23) surrounded by 2s or 1s, which makes sense if 2 is a dominant chain color and seeds are non-propagated starts.
 * It looks partially correct: Bottom row all 1s (untouched), second-last all 1s (perhaps input was mixed, but filled to proto? No, code doesn't fill bottom), chain row (row 27 in output) has isolated 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7 separated by 1s, matching expected chain preservation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 20-25) has 2s only in columns 20-24, with left side all 1s—no vertical propagation or inter-fill into left bg areas, suggesting missed overlaps with upper mixed rows (e.g., row17 has colors up to col23, should overlap and fill gaps above row20 if chain links, but remains 1/bg? Output shows 1s, implying no fill triggered—perhaps get_inner picks a row without left colors).
 * Gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) are fully 2-filled horizontally, which seems correct if upper/lower inners overlap in cols 3,10,22 (where seeds are) and chain has 2-4/2-8 etc., but vertically in those columns, bg above/below seeds isn't filled (e.g., col3 row4=2, but if vertical prop within section, why not extend from seed? Sections may not include seed rows if they are full-mixed).
 * Row 0 and row 28 all 1s (top/bottom borders, correct untouched). Row 21 all 1s? Wait, output row20 is mixed 1s and 2s on right—looks like partial section. Overall, over-reliance on 2 suggests chain starts/bridges with 2, but scattered seeds in row17 (cols 3,9,11,15-16,18,22) aren't bridged horizontally in that row (gaps are 2s, but if multi-color, no fill—correct, but expected more inter-fill below).
 * The output makes sense for a 2-dominant fill but misses potential fills in left-lower areas and between scattered seeds, differing from expectation of fuller propagation if sections/overlaps are broader; unknown if input had more bg in lower left, but output leaves it as 1s (proto? or bg not filled—code sets bg to colors, but if input 1s, untouched).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a walled structure (using 1 as proto/walls) with background (likely 0) and colored regions (numbers like 2,3,4,...), where the goal is to fill empty background areas horizontally and vertically based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a key row near the bottom of the grid. The filling propagates colors between wall-separated regions only if the bordering colors are adjacent in the chain sequence, using the preceding or matching color from the chain to decide the fill color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is identified from the last row's first cell, assumed to be 0 or empty; all fills target only bg cells without overwriting existing colors or walls.
 * The chain is a sequence of non-bg colors extracted from the second-to-last row (grid[n-2]), representing an ordering of colors that defines valid adjacencies for filling (e.g., colors must appear consecutively in the chain to allow propagation between regions).
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into sections both vertically (stacks of wall rows) and horizontally (within rows); sections are contiguous blocks of rows with at least one proto in them.
 * Vertical filling occurs between non-adjacent vertical sections (with gap rows in between) by identifying "inner" rows in each section (first non-pure-proto/bg row), extracting uniform-color regions in those inners, and filling overlapping horizontal spans in the gap rows with a color from the chain if the bordering region colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling happens within individual rows, between consecutive walls, filling bg in uniform-color regions if bordering colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Subtlety: Regions must be uniform single-color (no mixed colors within a wall-bounded segment) to be considered for filling; scattered same-color cells in a segment don't qualify unless contiguous (code uses min/max j of js, but assumes uniformity).
 * Adjacency in chain is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color based on order (if a then b, return a; if b then a, return b), which might imply directionality in propagation (e.g., fill with the earlier-in-chain color).
 * Easy to miss: Vertical sections skip the last two rows (while i < n-2), assuming the chain and bg rows are at the bottom and not part of sections; inner rows are chosen as the first row in a section with non-proto/bg content.
 * Gaps between sections must have no overlap in filling logic; if sections are adjacent (end1 +1 >= start2), no vertical fill.
 * Chain extraction ignores bg and proto, but assumes the row has meaningful sequence; if chain <2 elements, no filling.
 * Overwriting only bg; existing colors (like special numbers 3-9) stay, so fills don't propagate over pre-placed colors.
 * Grid dimensions: Assumes rectangular (n rows, m cols); early returns if n<3.
 * Potential edge case: Multiple regions per inner row; filling only where horizontal overlaps exist between upper/lower regions.
 * Chain may include duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's), allowing multiple adjacencies; is_adjacent_preceding checks for exact pairs in sequence, not just presence.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it successfully handled all three training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating solid core logic for basic vertical and horizontal filling between wall sections using chain adjacencies.
 * Worked well for identifying bg (0), extracting chain from second-last row, and finding vertical sections excluding bottom two rows.
 * Vertical fill correctly skips adjacent sections and only fills gaps where inner-row regions overlap horizontally and colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Horizontal fill properly identifies regions between walls in rows and fills if adjacent in chain, but only within the same row.
 * What didn't work/may be limited: get_inner_row picks only the first valid row in a section, potentially missing multi-row sections with varying inner content; if a section has no qualifying inner row (all proto/bg), skips entirely.
 * get_regions requires strictly uniform single color per inter-wall segment (set len==1), which works if regions are solid but may fail if input has pre-filled partials or mixed bg/colors; it also takes min/max of js but doesn't ensure full coverage (e.g., holes in region ignored).
 * is_adjacent_preceding is symmetric but biased toward the order in chain (returns the first in pair), which succeeded in training but might not handle reverse propagation or multi-hop chains.
 * No extraction of "objects" per se (e.g., full blobs or connected components); focuses on wall-bounded regions, which is helpful but assumes walls define all boundaries—may miss open areas without walls.
 * horizontal_fill re-extracts regions per row (redundant with get_regions) and uses index k of walls for positioning, which is functional but inefficient; it fills only between consecutive regions in the same row.
 * vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are applied sequentially (vert then horiz), which may overwrite or miss interactions if horiz creates new adjacencies for vert (but since copies grid, it's one-pass).
 * No handling for chain colors not present in regions (fills only if exact match); assumes proto=1 fixed, bg dynamic.
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of wall-section-chain rules but may underfill in complex test cases with multi-layer sections or non-uniform inners.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from lists) with heavy use of 1's as walls/borders, large areas filled with 2's (likely the dominant chain color), and isolated special colors (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) placed in specific positions across rows 3,10,17,23, matching a pattern like staggered "key" placements vertically aligned with the bottom chain row 27: [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,...].
 * It looks partially correct: Upper sections (rows 0-6,8-13) are mostly 2-filled between walls with specials like 4,8,9,6,7,4 in row 3/10, suggesting vertical propagation of 2's where adjacent to chain (assuming 2 is prevalent in chain), and specials are preserved (not overwritten).
 * Middle section (rows 15-19) has expanded 2's in central columns (14-19) with specials 9,4,5,3, indicating horizontal/vertical fills triggered by chain adjacencies (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 9/4/5/3, fill 2 in overlaps).
 * Lower sections (rows 21-25) have narrower 2-fills (columns 20-24) with 7 in row 23, showing localized filling, possibly due to narrower wall sections or no overlap with upper regions.
 * What doesn't look correct: Many areas remain as 1's or potentially unfilled (though output shows no explicit 0's, assuming bg was 0 and filled to 2's where possible); for example, rows 1-2,4-5, etc., mirror row structures but fill only 2's around specials without propagating the specials themselves upward/downward—e.g., the 4 in row 3 col 3 isn't filled vertically into row 2 col 3 (still 2?), suggesting vertical_fill didn't trigger for that pair (perhaps no chain adjacency between 4 and bordering 2, or no gap/overlap). Similarly, central expansions in rows 15-19 seem correct, but lower partial fills (only cols 20-24) differ from upper full-width 2's, possibly missing vertical propagation across full horizontal span if chain doesn't support wider overlaps. Bottom rows 26-28 are all 1's except the chain in 27, which is preserved correctly. Overall, it makes sense for a chain-heavy-2 puzzle but appears incomplete in propagating specials (e.g., no 4/8/9 fills beyond their input positions), which might be expected if the puzzle requires filling gaps with adjacent chain colors including specials; unknown if input had these specials pre-placed or if filling should expand them—differs from expectation of fuller special propagation if chain allows (e.g., if 4 adjacent to 2, why not fill more 4's?).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 21:51:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to propagate and fill background areas (typically 8) with appropriate colors based on adjacent colored segments separated by prototype walls (1), using rules derived from a "chain" of colors extracted from a specific row, while respecting sections defined by prototype presence and ensuring consistent vertical and horizontal propagation without overwriting existing colors or prototypes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg, often 8) is detected as the most common non-prototype color in upper rows (excluding the last two rows); if no such color, default to the bottom-left value.
 * The "chain" is a sequence of non-bg, non-proto colors extracted strictly from the second-to-last row (n-2), used to determine fill colors for gaps between adjacent segments of different colors (e.g., if colors a and b are adjacent in the chain, use the preceding color in that pair to fill between a and b segments).
 * Horizontal filling occurs within each row: identify segments between proto walls (1's), fill bg gaps within uniform-color segments, and fill bg gaps between adjacent uniform segments using the chain's adjacency rule.
 * Sections are contiguous row groups (from row 0 to n-3) that contain at least one proto but not all protos in the row; vertical propagation fills bg columns within a section based on uniform colors in vertical stacks between protos.
 * Between sections, if there's a gap (all-bg rows), fill vertically by matching overlapping horizontal regions from "inner" rows of adjacent sections (first non-empty row in each) using the chain for color adjacency, but only where segments overlap horizontally.
 * Subtleties: Propagation should not cross protos or fill entire rows/columns if they lack defining segments; chain adjacency checks both directions (a-b or b-a) and returns the first color in the pair; vertical fills within sections must skip protos and only fill if a single color dominates the stack; gaps between sections require both upper and lower sections to have defined inner regions, and fills are limited to overlapping column ranges; do not fill the last two rows (they seem reserved for chain and bottom border); proto (1) acts as impenetrable walls, never to be overwritten; in examples, bg is always 8, but detection allows flexibility; sections exclude fully-proto or fully-non-proto rows; horizontal fills happen before section-based verticals; unhelpful to fill non-bg areas or ignore chain order.
 * Easy to miss: Chain is only from row n-2 and ignores bg/proto there; adjacent preceding returns the first of the pair, not necessarily the common color; vertical propagation within sections is column-wise and stops at protos; between-section fills require exact overlap in column ranges and use inner rows (first non-proto/bg row in section); if no inner row (all proto/bg), skip; in multi-row sections, inner might be the first filled row post-horizontal; examples show symmetric fillings in gaps, but only where chain justifies; test grids have 1 as proto and bg, with colors 2-9, and last two rows as chain and border.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def detect_bg(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int, n: int, m: int) -> int:
    count = {}
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(m):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != proto:
                count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1
    if not count:
        return grid[n - 1][0] if n > 0 and m > 0 else 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the dominant non-proto color in upper grid, excluding last two rows.)

```python
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(This extracts the key color sequence from row n-2, filtering out bg and proto, essential for adjacency-based filling.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(This checks chain for adjacent pairs and returns the preceding color, handling both orders; crucial for gap fills, and handles same-color case by returning the color.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as contiguous rows with mixed proto/non-proto, excluding last two rows and fully proto/non-proto rows; useful for scoping vertical propagations.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    row = grid[i]
    walls = [-1] + [j for j in range(m) if row[j] == proto] + [m]
    comps: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    for k in range(len(walls) - 1):
        s = walls[k] + 1
        e = walls[k + 1] - 1
        if s > e:
            continue
        seg_colors = {row[j] for j in range(s, e + 1) if row[j] != proto and row[j] != bg}
        if len(seg_colors) == 1:
            c = next(iter(seg_colors))
            for j in range(s, e + 1):
                if row[j] == bg:
                    row[j] = c
            comps.append((s, e, c))
    for k in range(len(comps) - 1):
        left_s, left_e, a = comps[k]
        right_s, right_e, b = comps[k + 1]
        fill_c = is_adjacent_preceding(chain, a, b)
        if fill_c is not None:
            for j in range(left_e + 1, right_s):
                if row[j] == bg:
                    row[j] = fill_c
```
(This performs intra-row filling: uniform segment gap fills and between-segment chain-based fills; applied to all upper rows, foundational step.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    for j in range(m):
        i = sec_start
        while i <= sec_end:
            if grid[i][j] == proto:
                i += 1
                continue
            v_start = i
            colors_set = set()
            i_temp = i
            while i_temp <= sec_end and grid[i_temp][j] != proto:
                cc = grid[i_temp][j]
                if cc != bg and cc != proto:
                    colors_set.add(cc)
                i_temp += 1
            v_end = i_temp - 1
            if len(colors_set) == 1:
                c = next(iter(colors_set))
                for k in range(v_start, v_end + 1):
                    if grid[k][j] == bg:
                        grid[k][j] = c
            i = i_temp
```
(This fills vertical bg stacks within a section if dominated by one color, skipping protos; post-horizontal, good for intra-section consistency.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program applies horizontal fills correctly in many local segments but fails on vertical propagations between sections, leaving gap rows all bg where expected has patterned fills (e.g., in Train 1, rows 5-7 should have 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in cols 15-16, but generated all 8's; similarly, row 12 has 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in cols 15-16 expected, but generated all 8's except some misplaced).
 * In Train 1, upper sections (rows 1-4) filled horizontally well (e.g., 7's in cols 11-13, 1's around), but between-section gap (rows 5-7) unfilled; lower sections partially filled but missed between row 8-11 and 13-16 gap (row 12 unfilled); chain seems extracted correctly but not used for vertical gaps.
 * Train 2 generated has incorrect horizontal fills, e.g., row 1 has 2 in col 4 where expected 8 (bg), and row 4 has 3 in col 6 where expected all bg except sections; vertical in row 4-5 gap unfilled (expected 3,6,7 isolated but program filled wrongly); sections misidentified, leading to overfills like 2,3,5,7 propagating incorrectly; chain adjacency not triggering vertical between sections.
 * Train 3 generated fills upper section (rows 1-5) with some extras like 3's propagating where expected 8's (e.g., row 1-2 cols 6-8 should be 8's, but filled 3's); middle section (rows 8-11) similar overfill with 4's; lower section (rows 17-21) unfilled vertically where expected 8's in some but program left bg; between-section gaps like rows 6-7 and 12-16 mostly unfilled (expected some 6's in cols 11 and 9 in row 6); row 3 has 3's and 2's correct but 9 in col 19 filled early.
 * Function `get_inner` is helpful but buggy: it returns the first non-proto/bg row in section, but in generated, it skips fills if inner is None or mismatched, leading to no between-section verticals; in Train 1, inner_u for upper section is row 1 (has 1's,2's), inner_l row 8 (1's,3's), but no overlap fill happened for cols 2-3 (2's) or 15-16 (6's).
 * Function `get_filled_regions` is useful for identifying uniform segments post-horizontal, but in between-section logic, it only fills if exact overlap and chain match, but generated misses non-overlapping or partial overlaps (e.g., Train 1 row 12 cols 8-9 for 9's from upper 9's? but chain issue).
 * The main program applies horizontal_fill to all rows <n-2 correctly, but vertical_propagate_within only within sections (good), but between-sections loop fails to trigger fills, possibly due to no overlap detection or chain not finding preceding (e.g., in Train 1, 2 and 6 may not be adjacent in chain [from row 18: 2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5? wait, row 18 has 2 8 3 8 9 8 4 8 2 8 6 8 7 8 5 8 8 8 8, so chain [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5], yes 2-6 adjacent via 2-6? no direct, but 4-2 then 2-6? wait, checks pairs, so 2-6 is direct pair, preceding 2).
 * Unhelpful: No function for full vertical chain propagation across gaps; current between-section only does horizontal overlap-based, but examples need full-column patterned fills matching upper/lower patterns via chain; `detect_bg` works (8), but if grid has varying bg, it might fail.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output performs horizontal fills correctly within sections (e.g., rows 1-5 fill 4's in cols 1-5, 8's in 8-12, 9's in 20-24; rows 8-12 fill 6's cols 1-5, 7's 8-12, 4's 20-24; rows 15-19 fill 9's 1-5, 4's 8-12, 5's 14-18, 3's 20-24), and some vertical within sections (e.g., uniform across multi-rows), but leaves between-section gaps all 1's (bg here is 1?) unfilled—e.g., rows 6-7 and 13-14 all 1's, but expected likely has patterned fills like vertical extensions of 4-8-9 or 6-7-4 using chain from row 26 [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,... filtered non-1], such as filling row 6-7 with 8's where upper 8's overlap lower? but no, gaps should propagate via chain adjacencies (e.g., 4 adjacent to 6? chain has 4-7,7-6 no; but 9-4 in lower to upper).
 * It does not look correct because gaps (rows 6-7 between upper 4/8/9 section and middle 6/7/4; rows 13-14 between middle and lower 9/4/5/3; row 20? wait 20 is section start, but row 25? wait grid has 28 rows?) are unfilled, similar to training failures—expected should have vertical fills in gaps matching adjacent section colors via chain (e.g., row 6 cols 8-12 might fill 7? if 8-7 adjacent in chain, but chain has 8? row 26 has 4 1 8 1 9 etc., chain [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7], so 8-9 pair preceding 8; 4-7 pair 4, etc.), and bottom section rows 21-25 fill 7's cols 20-24 correctly but gaps above unfilled; also, bg is 1 here (all borders 1), proto 1? wait no, proto=1 but bg also 1? detection may fail since upper counts 1 as proto, but if 1 is both, max non-1 is say 4, but generated treats 1 as bg, filling over it wrongly? wait, in generated, it fills sections but leaves 1's in gaps, suggesting bg=1 detected wrong or proto=1 skips properly, but no vertical gap fills.
 * Test output misses between-section vertical propagations entirely, like trainings, and may have bg detection issue (upper rows have many 1's as proto/border, but colors like 4 appear, so bg should be absent or default, but generated fills as if 1 is bg); also, row 0 and 27 all 1's correct (borders), row 26 chain untouched, but no gap patterns (e.g., row 6 should perhaps have 8's in cols 8-12 if propagating from upper 8 to lower 7 via chain 8-9-4-7 no direct, but logic needs adjustment for non-direct? no, only adjacent pairs).

[2025-09-30 21:51:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1). The filling propagates colors from the chain into background areas, but only where components are adjacent in the chain and connect properly through the grid's outlined shapes, without overfilling or ignoring vertical extensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is consistently the dominant filler (e.g., 8 in training examples 1 and 2, 1 in example 3 and test), identified from the bottom-left of the last row; all empty spaces start as bg.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row (n-2), filtering non-bg cells to form a sequence of colors that serves as a key for filling; positions in the chain matter for adjacency (e.g., colors at positions differing by 1 are adjacent).
 * "Proto" is the outline color (e.g., 1), found in rows above the chain by identifying rows with exactly one non-bg color; this acts as a boundary or connector, and fillings should not overwrite proto but can bridge through gaps in proto-outlined regions.
 * Components in each row (i < n-2) are contiguous non-bg segments; for each row, identify sub-components (groups of same-color cells), excluding bg and proto, and assign a primary color (proto if no other, or the dominant non-proto/bg color).
 * Filling occurs only between adjacent components in the same row if their colors are adjacent in the chain (checked via position proximity in chain, e.g., any pair of positions abs(diff)==1); gaps are filled with the chain's color at the minimal position of the adjacent pair.
 * Subtlety: Filling is horizontal within rows but must account for vertical propagation or extension from the chain upwards, especially into all-bg areas directly above chain positions (e.g., creating vertical blobs like 2x3 in train1 rows 6-7); the current program only fills horizontally and skips proto-adjacent cases, missing these verticals.
 * Do not fill if either component involves proto (current skip condition is too broad: "if comps[k][2] == proto or comps[k + 1][2] == proto: continue"), which prevents necessary bridging.
 * Chain adjacency check uses all positions of a color (pos1 + pos2), finding min_p for fill color, but fails if colors appear multiple times non-adjacently; this works for simple cases but misses multi-occurrence logic.
 * Grids have varying widths (20 in train1/2, 27 in train3, 29 in test); ensure m = len(grid[0]) handles this.
 * Outlined shapes (e.g., 1's forming boundaries around inner colors like 2,3,4) suggest enclosed regions that should be filled consistently with chain colors, but only where connected vertically/horizontally without crossing outlines.
 * Last two rows are fixed (chain in n-2, bg in n-1); processing only affects rows 0 to n-3.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical stacking of fillings (e.g., expected train1 has 3-row vertical 2's and 6's in rows 6-8, but generated has none); program doesn't propagate upwards iteratively.
 * No diagonal connections; only orthogonal (horizontal in row, vertical implied by chain position).
 * Colors 2-9 are fillers; 1/8 often bg or proto, but bg varies per grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    return [grid[n-2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n-2][j] != bg]

# Helpful inline snippet: Find proto (outline color)
def find_proto(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> int:
    for row in grid[:-2]:
        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:
    non_bg_pos = [j for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] != bg]
    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where regions bounded by prototype walls (1) and background (typically 8) are filled with colors (2-9) by propagating single-color dominance within segments, vertically within wall-defined sections, and horizontally/vertically across section gaps if colors are adjacent in a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row; the goal is to complete the grid without overfilling or misapplying rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows (0 to n-3), but only if present; empty grids return unchanged.
 * Chain extraction takes the second-last row (n-2), filtering out bg and proto to get a sequence of colors that defines "adjacency" for filling (e.g., if a and b are neighbors in chain, the preceding color can fill gaps between regions of a and b).
 * Horizontal filling occurs in every upper row (0 to n-3): between proto walls, if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, between adjacent filled segments with colors a and b, if they are adjacent in chain, fill the proto/bg gap with the preceding color from the adjacency.
 * Sections are contiguous blocks of rows (from 0 to n-3) that contain some (but not all) proto cells; these define vertical propagation zones.
 * Vertical propagation within a section: for each column, between proto cells, if the non-bg/non-proto cells in the vertical segment have exactly one color, fill bg cells in that segment with it.
 * Inter-section filling: between consecutive sections, for gap rows, if inner rows of sections have horizontally overlapping filled regions with colors a and b that are adjacent in chain, fill the entire overlapping vertical/horizontal gap area with the preceding color—but only if regions overlap horizontally (max start <= min end +1).
 * Subtlety: get_inner picks the first non-bg/non-proto row in a section as representative for region extraction; this assumes sections have consistent inner structure but can miss if sections have varying filled rows.
 * Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the preceding color (first in the pair), and same colors return themselves; no filling if no adjacency.
 * Proto (1) acts as walls/barriers; bg is never propagated as a color.
 * Edge cases: empty segments, all-proto rows (skipped), no chain (no inter-fills), sections touching (no gap), or non-overlapping regions (no cross-fill).
 * The bottom two rows (n-2 and n-1) are typically the chain and a fixed bottom bar; they are not processed for filling.
 * Overfilling risk: horizontal fill runs before sections, so it can create filled regions used in vertical/inter steps; but vertical only within sections, not across.
 * Assumption: grids are rectangular, colors 1-9, bg dominant in empties.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def detect_bg(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> int:
    n = len(grid)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    m = len(grid[0])
    count = {}
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(m):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != proto:
                count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(Detects background as most frequent non-proto in upper rows; useful for identifying fill target.)

```python
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(grid)
    if n < 2:
        return []
    m = len(grid[0])
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(Extracts the adjacency chain from row n-2, excluding bg/proto; core for determining fill colors between regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(Checks if a and b are adjacent in chain and returns the preceding color; essential for gap filling, handles symmetry.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    n = len(grid)
    if n < 2:
        return []
    m = len(grid[0])
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(Identifies contiguous sections of rows with partial proto; useful for scoping vertical propagation.)

(Performs horizontal segment filling and gap filling within a row; key for initial color spread.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture: horizontal and vertical propagation work partially, but inter-section gap filling and section detection miss cases.
 * Train 1: Generated filled upper sections correctly (e.g., 1-2-5-7 blocks in rows 1-4), but failed to fill gap between sections 0-4 and 8-11 (expected 2 in cols 2-3 rows 5-7, 6 in cols 15-16 rows 5-7; generated all 8s); also overfilled row 12 with 9s in cols 8-9 (expected 8s), and misplaced 9s in row 12; bottom chain row 18 has correct sequence but no propagation upward.
 * Train 1: get_inner selected row 8 for second section, but expected fillings suggest propagation from row 9-11; horizontal_fill didn't bridge non-adjacent chain pairs (e.g., 2 and 6 not adjacent in chain [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]).
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled some bg with 1 or 2 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 4=2 but expected 8; row 4 cols 6=3 but expected 8 in a proto-heavy area); missed vertical propagation in section 4-7 (expected isolated 3,6,7 in row 4 cols 6,10,14 but generated 8s); sections misdetected, leading to no gap fill between upper and lower blocks.
 * Train 2: Chain likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] from row 11, but is_adjacent_preceding not applied correctly for cross-section (e.g., no fill for 3-6-7 isolation); horizontal_fill filled some segments but skipped gaps due to multi-color or non-adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated upper sections (rows 1-5 all filled similarly, but expected varied with 8s in some proto areas); missed vertical fills in lower sections (e.g., rows 13-17 expected 6 in col 11, but generated 8s; rows 17-21 expected isolated 8s but filled with 1s erroneously); inter-section gap (rows 6-7 and 12) not filled (expected 9 in row 6 col 19, 6 in rows 13-17 col 11).
 * Train 3: Larger grid (27 cols) exposed section detection bug—find_sections skipped some partial-proto rows (e.g., row 20 has partial but treated as full bg); vertical_propagate_within overfilled 1s into bg areas; chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] not used for gaps between multi-section blocks.
 * Overall: horizontal_fill works for single-color segments but fails gap fills if chain order wrong or segments not adjacent; vertical_propagate_within skips multi-color verticals correctly but doesn't handle section edges; inter-section logic in program() buggy—get_filled_regions uses inner row only, missing if inner has no fills yet, and overlap check (max(st1,st2) <= min(en1,en2)+1) too strict, preventing non-exact overlaps; no iteration (fills don't propagate after initial horizontal).
 * Function vertical_propagate_within is helpful but limited to sections—extend to full columns? But no, rules confine to sections.
 * Function get_filled_regions is similar to horizontal_fill logic but extracts only—useful but redundant if run after fills.
 * Function get_inner assumes first non-empty row, but if sections have bg-only inners initially, returns None and skips fills (bug in trains).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows uniform block fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4s in cols 1-5, 8s in 8-12; rows 8-13 6s/7s/4s) suggesting horizontal_fill worked for large segments, but vertical propagation seems absent or incomplete (e.g., no blending between row blocks 6-7 and 8-14, which should be sections separated by all-1 rows); inter-section gaps (rows 7,14,21) remain all 1s (proto?), but expected would fill based on chain adjacency if blocks like 4-8-9 adjacent.
 * Test output over-relies on horizontal: entire rows filled uniformly without vertical consistency (e.g., row 15-20 has 9-4-5-3 blocks, but no upward propagation from chain row 27 [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] into gaps); chain includes 1s (proto?), which shouldn't be in chain—extract_chain filters them, but output suggests misdetection (bg=1? but 1 is proto, detect_bg skips proto so bg likely another).
 * Test output misses subtle overlaps: e.g., if sections at rows 0-6 (4/8/9) and 8-13 (6/7/4), gap row 7 should fill where 4 and 6 adjacent in chain (preceding color), but remains 1s; similarly, lower sections not bridged (e.g., 9 and 4 in rows 15-20 and 22-26 should fill row 21 if adjacent).
 * Bg detection likely wrong—upper rows have 1s (proto) and some colors, but if 1 dominates non-proto count? No, detect_bg counts non-proto, so bg= some color like 1? Wait, proto=1 skipped, so bg= most common other (but output fills with colors, not bg); output has 1s as walls but fills bg-spots with colors correctly in blocks, but no gap fills, suggesting inter-section logic broken for large grids (29 cols).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for intra-section fills but ignores chain-based bridging, leaving gaps unfilled—does not match expected full completion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where regions of colored cells (numbers 2-9) are partially filled, separated by prototype walls (1's) and background (typically 8's or similar empty spaces), and the goal is to propagate and fill the background spaces with appropriate colors based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a specific row (often the second-to-last row, excluding backgrounds and prototypes). The filling follows horizontal and vertical propagation within sections bounded by prototypes, and bridging gaps between sections using chain-based color matching, ultimately producing a completed grid that matches expected patterns without overfilling or misapplying colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototypes (proto=1) act as walls or dividers that bound sections; they should not be overwritten, and filling stops at them.
 * Background (bg, often 8) is the empty space to fill; detection of bg is crucial and should be the most common non-proto color in early rows (code uses rows 0 to n-3).
 * The chain is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, which serves as a reference for "adjacent preceding" color rules—e.g., if two colors A and B are adjacent in the chain (in either order), a fill color C can bridge them if C precedes them adjacently in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling occurs within rows, filling bg gaps between proto walls if the segment has a single dominant color, and bridging adjacent segments if their colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Vertical propagation fills bg within column segments bounded by proto in a section, using the single color if present.
 * Sections are contiguous row groups (from 0 to n-3) that contain some but not all proto in a row; gaps between sections (rows with all bg or all proto?) are bridged vertically by finding overlapping horizontal regions in "inner" rows of adjacent sections and filling the gap rows with chain-derived colors where overlaps match.
 * Subtlety: "Inner" rows for bridging are the first non-proto/bg row in a section; if none, skip. Overlaps are horizontal position-based (max start to min end).
 * Chain adjacency check (is_adjacent_preceding) returns the preceding color if A and B are neighbors in chain, but only if they match exactly (order flexible); if A==B, return A. This is used for bridging but may fail if chain order matters directionally (unobserved).
 * Gaps between sections only fill where upper and lower regions overlap horizontally; non-overlapping areas stay bg.
 * Easy to miss: Full-row bg or proto rows (like rows n-1 and n-2 in some examples) are not processed for sections or chain if excluded; chain is strictly from row n-2 non-bg/proto cells.
 * Another subtlety: In vertical propagation, collect colors in a column segment excluding bg/proto, and fill only if exactly one unique color; multi-color segments don't fill.
 * Horizontal fill first applies to all rows 0 to n-3, then vertical within sections, then inter-section bridging—order matters to avoid overfilling.
 * Bg detection scans only early rows (0 to n-3), assuming later rows are chain/reserved; if grid has varying bg, this fails.
 * In examples, some expected fillings create vertical stacks (e.g., 2's and 6's in gaps) that span multiple rows, suggesting bridging applies to entire gap height.
 * Proto rows can be partial; sections end when a row is all proto or no proto.
 * Chain may have duplicates or orders that imply directionality (e.g., 2 before 3 allows filling with 2 between 3-regions? But code returns preceding, which may be wrong).
 * Test inputs may have different bg (e.g., 1 as bg?) or wider grids, requiring robust detection.
 * Unobserved: Some expected outputs leave certain bg unfilled if no chain match, or fill with specific colors from chain positions.

def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    # Fills bg vertically in columns within a section if single color in segment. Good for intra-section consistency, but doesn't handle multi-color.
    # (Full as in code.)
```

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `get_inner`: Attempts to find first non-bg/proto row in section for bridging reference, but in examples, it picks rows that lead to wrong overlaps (e.g., picks filled rows, causing no bridging).
- `get_filled_regions`: Extracts single-color segments between proto in a row, but when used for bridging, it fails to align upper/lower overlaps correctly, leading to no fills in gaps.
- Overall program structure: Applies horizontal fill to all rows first (good), vertical within sections (partial), but inter-section bridging is flawed—wrong inner row selection and overlap logic miss vertical stacks in gaps.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects bg=8 and extracts chain (e.g., in Train 1: [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5,...]), and applies some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., fills single-color segments like 7's in Train 1 row 2).
 * Horizontal fill works partially: In Train 1, it correctly fills some bg to match colors within segments (e.g., row 1 fills 1's), but overfills bridges incorrectly (e.g., fills 7's where expected has 8's in row 1 cols 11-13).
 * Vertical propagation works in simple cases but misses in complex sections: In Train 1, it fills some but leaves gaps unfilled vertically.
 * Section finding identifies partial-proto row groups correctly (e.g., Train 1 sections at rows 1-4 and 8-11), but bridging between sections fails entirely—no fills in gap rows 5-7 and 12-13, where expected has vertical 2's (cols 2-3) and 6's (cols 16-17) based on chain adjacency (e.g., 2 precedes 1? Chain links needed).
 * In Train 1 generated vs expected: Rows 1 differs (generated fills 7's in cols 11-13 and 1's in 14-17; expected has 8's in 11-13); rows 5-7 all 8's in generated but expected has 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17 across 3 rows; row 12 all 8's but expected has 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; row 13 differs (generated has 1's/4's/2's but expected has 1's/8's). Reason unknown but likely wrong overlap detection in bridging.
 * In Train 2 generated vs expected: Minimal filling (many 8's stay); row 1 has extra 2 in col 4 (generated) vs 8 expected; rows 4-5 all 8's but expected row 4 has 3/6/7 isolated; no bridging fills vertical gaps (e.g., expected row 4 has scattered colors, but generated leaves empty). Chain [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] not used for bridging.
 * In Train 3 generated vs expected: Fills some horizontals (e.g., row 1 3's and 2's match), but verticals overfill (e.g., rows 4-5 duplicate row 1 fills incorrectly); sections found but bridging misses (rows 6 empty, expected has 9 in col 19; rows 12-16 all 8's but expected has 6's in col 11 across 5 rows); rows 17-22 have partial 1's but expected has 8's in many places and 9/7 isolated. Overpropagation in vertical func likely.
 * extract_chain is essential and correct for adjacency rules.
 * horizontal_fill is partially helpful but bridges too aggressively without checking chain direction.
 * vertical_propagate_within is useful but skips multi-color segments correctly—issue is in section bounds.
 * find_sections works but excludes gap rows properly.
 * is_adjacent_preceding may be broken: Returns preceding (left) in chain, but expected bridges might need the common predecessor or something else (unknown why gaps like 2's in Train 1).
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are incorrect for bridging: Wrong row selection (e.g., picks bottom of section) and overlap calc misses vertical extension to full gap height.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of sections and chain but fails bridging logic, leading to empty gaps where expected has stacked colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massively with 1's (likely misdetected as bg or proto), creating solid rows of 1's (e.g., row 0 all 1's, row 26 all 1's) where expected likely has structured regions and bg preserved in non-fill areas.
 * It applies some block fills (e.g., 4's in rows 1-6 cols 1-5, 9's in rows 1-6 cols 20-24, 6's in rows 8-14 cols 1-5), which may match intra-section propagation, but chain-based bridging seems absent (e.g., row 14 has 4's but no connection to upper/lower; rows 15-16 have mixed but overfilled with 1's in non-region spots).
 * Gaps like between rows 6-7 (all 1's/9's but mismatched) and rows 20-25 (7's but bordered by 1's) suggest failed section detection or bg=1 misfill, leaving no empty spaces and ignoring chain (unseen, but likely [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] from row 27).
 * This doesn't make sense as a completed puzzle—too uniform with 1's everywhere outside blocks, unlike training expecteds that preserve bg in non-connected areas and use chain for targeted fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where a partially colored canvas (with numbers 1-9 representing walls/proto=1 and colors, and 8 as background) must be completed by propagating and bridging colors horizontally and vertically, guided by a "chain" of allowed adjacent colors extracted from near the bottom row, ensuring fills respect wall boundaries and only use colors that are sequential in the chain for bridging gaps between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg=8) is the most common non-proto color in the top n-2 rows; it must be distinguished from actual colors (2-9) to avoid over-filling.
 * The chain is extracted from row n-2 (second-to-last row), including only non-bg, non-proto cells; this acts as a legend of sequential color adjacencies (e.g., if chain has ...A B..., A and B can bridge via fill with A if A precedes B).
 * Proto/walls (1) divide the grid into "sections" (consecutive rows with mixed proto and non-proto cells); vertical propagation fills bg within columns of a section only if a single non-bg/non-proto color dominates that column segment.
 * Horizontal fills occur row-by-row (for i in 0 to n-3): within a row, uniform-color segments (bounded by proto) get bg filled to match; adjacent segments bridge bg/proto gaps only if their colors are adjacent in the chain, filling with the preceding color in the pair.
 * Gaps between sections (rows between end of one section and start of next) are bridged vertically in overlapping column ranges: find uniform regions in "inner" rows of adjacent sections, check chain adjacency, and fill the gap rows' overlapping columns with the preceding color (replacing bg or proto).
 * Subtlety: Sections are only rows with some (but not all) proto cells; pure bg or pure proto rows are skipped. Inner rows for gap bridging are the first non-proto/non-bg row in a section.
 * Easy to miss: Chain adjacency is symmetric in detection but asymmetric in fill (uses preceding color); same-color regions don't need chain check. Fills shouldn't overwrite existing colors or cross proto walls. No diagonal propagation. Chain may have duplicates or gaps.
 * Across attempts: Bg detection fails if top rows have mixed colors (e.g., training 1 overfills with 8 in places expected to bridge). Vertical propagation doesn't handle multi-section overlaps correctly. Gap bridging assumes single inner row per section but may need multi-row consensus. Horizontal bridging in rows doesn't always trigger if segments aren't uniform.
 * Test input considerations: Assuming similar structure (top empty-ish, mid sections with colors/walls, bottom chain row), fills should propagate within walled blobs (e.g., uniform 4's, 9's) and bridge via chain (e.g., if chain allows 4-8 adjacency, fill between them with preceding). Proto=1 acts as borders, not fillable.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def detect_bg(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int, n: int, m: int) -> int:
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(m):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != proto:
                count[c] += 1
    if count:
        return max(count, key=count.get)
    return grid[n - 1][0] if n > 0 and m > 0 else 0
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode non-proto in upper grid; helpful for distinguishing empty space.)

    if n < 2:
        return []

            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(Core rule for bridging: checks chain adjacency and returns preceding color for fill; symmetric detection but directed fill.)

            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(Identifies wall-bounded sections for vertical propagation; helpful but buggy—excludes bottom rows and may misalign if sections touch chain row.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core bugs in propagation and bridging.
 * Training 1: Generated overfilled row 5 and 6 with 8's instead of expected 2's and 6's in columns 2-3 and 15-16; also filled row 12 with 8's in columns 8-10 where expected 9's; bottom sections like row 13 misplaced 9's to row 12. What worked: Correctly detected bg=8 and chain (implicitly [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]); horizontal fills in rows 1-4 and 8-11 matched expected 1-blobs and inner colors. What didn't: Vertical propagation missed bridging gaps (e.g., rows 5-7 should bridge upper 1-regions to lower via chain?); gap fill between sections overwrote with 8 or skipped (e.g., rows 5-7 expected partial 2/6 from chain adjacency).
 * Training 2: Generated filled row 1 columns 4/14 with 2/5 instead of 8 (bg); row 4 all 8's but expected partial 3/6/7 in columns 6/10/14. What worked: Chain extraction likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9]; some horizontal fills in rows 1-3/5-7 matched (e.g., 1-blobs around 2/5/7). What didn't: Bg detection may have erred (filled non-bg areas); vertical propagation in sections didn't fill row 4 gaps correctly (expected isolated colors from chain?); no bridging between upper/lower sections, leaving row 4 empty-ish.
 * Training 3: Generated duplicated row 1-5 fills into row 5 (extra 3/2 blobs); row 6 all 8's but expected empty; row 7 empty but expected 9 in col 19; rows 13-17 all 8's but expected 6 in col 11; row 18-22 partial but missed 8-fills around 1's. What worked: Section detection caught upper/mid blobs (rows 1-5/7-12/18-22); horizontal fills in row 3 matched 3/2/9. What didn't: Vertical propagation over-duplicated fills across sections; gap bridging between rows 5-7 and 12-13 failed (e.g., row 6/7/13-17 should bridge via chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] but filled wrong or skipped); chain adjacency not applied to isolated bottom colors.
 * Overall: Horizontal_fill works for intra-row uniform segments but fails bridging if segments aren't single-color or chain check misses order. Vertical_propagate_within is helpful for column fills but limited to sections (misses cross-section). Gap fill logic in program() assumes single inner row and overwrites proto incorrectly; doesn't handle non-overlapping regions. find_sections skips bottom (good, preserves chain) but may cut sections early. No extraction of "objects" (blobs) function, but get_filled_regions acts as one for rows—extend to 2D blobs? get_inner finds section reps but picks first non-empty row, which may not represent (e.g., if varying heights).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on training patterns and inferred rules; it over-propagates uniform fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4's in cols 1-5, rows 8-13 all 6's in cols 0-4, but likely input had partial seeds—fills should stop at walls/proto=1 and only bridge via chain, not blanket entire sections). Rows 14-15 have mixed 6/4 but row 16 jumps to 9/4/5/3 without clear vertical propagation; rows 21-25 uniform 7's suggest missed gap bridging (expected partial from chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 9-5). Bottom row 27 has isolated colors (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) matching chain pattern, but row 28 all 1's (bg?) should be empty/preserved. Differences: Too many full-block fills (e.g., 9's in rows 15-20 cols 20-24) without respecting potential wall gaps; no evident chain-based bridging (e.g., if chain is [4,8,9,7,6,4,5,3,7], why no preceding fills between 4-8 or 9-5?). Likely bg=1 here (all borders 1), but program assumed 8—mismatch causes wrong detection. Output ignores subtle section gaps (e.g., rows 6-7/13-14/20-21 all partial 1's or 9's, expected bridged colors). To fix: Adjust bg detection for 1-borders; add 2D blob extraction for better region matching; ensure gap fills only in overlapping cols with chain-preceding color.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to propagate and fill background areas (typically 8) with appropriate colors based on adjacent colored segments separated by prototype walls (1), using rules derived from a "chain" of colors extracted from a specific row, while respecting sections defined by prototype presence and ensuring consistent vertical and horizontal propagation without overwriting existing colors or prototypes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg, often 8) is detected as the most common non-prototype color in upper rows (excluding the last two rows); if no such color, default to the bottom-left value.
 * The "chain" is a sequence of non-bg, non-proto colors extracted strictly from the second-to-last row (n-2), used to determine fill colors for gaps between adjacent segments of different colors (e.g., if colors a and b are adjacent in the chain, use the preceding color in that pair to fill between a and b segments).
 * Horizontal filling occurs within each row: identify segments between proto walls (1's), fill bg gaps within uniform-color segments, and fill bg gaps between adjacent uniform segments using the chain's adjacency rule.
 * Sections are contiguous row groups (from row 0 to n-3) that contain at least one proto but not all protos in the row; vertical propagation fills bg columns within a section based on uniform colors in vertical stacks between protos.
 * Between sections, if there's a gap (all-bg rows), fill vertically by matching overlapping horizontal regions from "inner" rows of adjacent sections (first non-empty row in each) using the chain for color adjacency, but only where segments overlap horizontally.
 * Subtleties: Propagation should not cross protos or fill entire rows/columns if they lack defining segments; chain adjacency checks both directions (a-b or b-a) and returns the first color in the pair; vertical fills within sections must skip protos and only fill if a single color dominates the stack; gaps between sections require both upper and lower sections to have defined inner regions, and fills are limited to overlapping column ranges; do not fill the last two rows (they seem reserved for chain and bottom border); proto (1) acts as impenetrable walls, never to be overwritten; in examples, bg is always 8, but detection allows flexibility; sections exclude fully-proto or fully-non-proto rows; horizontal fills happen before section-based verticals; unhelpful to fill non-bg areas or ignore chain order.
 * Easy to miss: Chain is only from row n-2 and ignores bg/proto there; adjacent preceding returns the first of the pair, not necessarily the common color; vertical propagation within sections is column-wise and stops at protos; between-section fills require exact overlap in column ranges and use inner rows (first non-proto/bg row in section); if no inner row (all proto/bg), skip; in multi-row sections, inner might be the first filled row post-horizontal; examples show symmetric fillings in gaps, but only where chain justifies; test grids have 1 as proto and bg, with colors 2-9, and last two rows as chain and border.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def detect_bg(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int, n: int, m: int) -> int:
    count = {}
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(m):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != proto:
                count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1
    if not count:
        return grid[n - 1][0] if n > 0 and m > 0 else 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the dominant non-proto color in upper grid, excluding last two rows.)

```python
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(This extracts the key color sequence from row n-2, filtering out bg and proto, essential for adjacency-based filling.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(This checks chain for adjacent pairs and returns the preceding color, handling both orders; crucial for gap fills, and handles same-color case by returning the color.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as contiguous rows with mixed proto/non-proto, excluding last two rows and fully proto/non-proto rows; useful for scoping vertical propagations.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    row = grid[i]
    walls = [-1] + [j for j in range(m) if row[j] == proto] + [m]
    comps: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    for k in range(len(walls) - 1):
        s = walls[k] + 1
        e = walls[k + 1] - 1
        if s > e:
            continue
        seg_colors = {row[j] for j in range(s, e + 1) if row[j] != proto and row[j] != bg}
        if len(seg_colors) == 1:
            c = next(iter(seg_colors))
            for j in range(s, e + 1):
                if row[j] == bg:
                    row[j] = c
            comps.append((s, e, c))
    for k in range(len(comps) - 1):
        left_s, left_e, a = comps[k]
        right_s, right_e, b = comps[k + 1]
        fill_c = is_adjacent_preceding(chain, a, b)
        if fill_c is not None:
            for j in range(left_e + 1, right_s):
                if row[j] == bg:
                    row[j] = fill_c
```
(This performs intra-row filling: uniform segment gap fills and between-segment chain-based fills; applied to all upper rows, foundational step.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    for j in range(m):
        i = sec_start
        while i <= sec_end:
            if grid[i][j] == proto:
                i += 1
                continue
            v_start = i
            colors_set = set()
            i_temp = i
            while i_temp <= sec_end and grid[i_temp][j] != proto:
                cc = grid[i_temp][j]
                if cc != bg and cc != proto:
                    colors_set.add(cc)
                i_temp += 1
            v_end = i_temp - 1
            if len(colors_set) == 1:
                c = next(iter(colors_set))
                for k in range(v_start, v_end + 1):
                    if grid[k][j] == bg:
                        grid[k][j] = c
            i = i_temp
```
(This fills vertical bg stacks within a section if dominated by one color, skipping protos; post-horizontal, good for intra-section consistency.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program applies horizontal fills correctly in many local segments but fails on vertical propagations between sections, leaving gap rows all bg where expected has patterned fills (e.g., in Train 1, rows 5-7 should have 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in cols 15-16, but generated all 8's; similarly, row 12 has 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in cols 15-16 expected, but generated all 8's except some misplaced).
 * In Train 1, upper sections (rows 1-4) filled horizontally well (e.g., 7's in cols 11-13, 1's around), but between-section gap (rows 5-7) unfilled; lower sections partially filled but missed between row 8-11 and 13-16 gap (row 12 unfilled); chain seems extracted correctly but not used for vertical gaps.
 * Train 2 generated has incorrect horizontal fills, e.g., row 1 has 2 in col 4 where expected 8 (bg), and row 4 has 3 in col 6 where expected all bg except sections; vertical in row 4-5 gap unfilled (expected 3,6,7 isolated but program filled wrongly); sections misidentified, leading to overfills like 2,3,5,7 propagating incorrectly; chain adjacency not triggering vertical between sections.
 * Train 3 generated fills upper section (rows 1-5) with some extras like 3's propagating where expected 8's (e.g., row 1-2 cols 6-8 should be 8's, but filled 3's); middle section (rows 8-11) similar overfill with 4's; lower section (rows 17-21) unfilled vertically where expected 8's in some but program left bg; between-section gaps like rows 6-7 and 12-16 mostly unfilled (expected some 6's in cols 11 and 9 in row 6); row 3 has 3's and 2's correct but 9 in col 19 filled early.
 * Function `get_inner` is helpful but buggy: it returns the first non-proto/bg row in section, but in generated, it skips fills if inner is None or mismatched, leading to no between-section verticals; in Train 1, inner_u for upper section is row 1 (has 1's,2's), inner_l row 8 (1's,3's), but no overlap fill happened for cols 2-3 (2's) or 15-16 (6's).
 * Function `get_filled_regions` is useful for identifying uniform segments post-horizontal, but in between-section logic, it only fills if exact overlap and chain match, but generated misses non-overlapping or partial overlaps (e.g., Train 1 row 12 cols 8-9 for 9's from upper 9's? but chain issue).
 * The main program applies horizontal_fill to all rows <n-2 correctly, but vertical_propagate_within only within sections (good), but between-sections loop fails to trigger fills, possibly due to no overlap detection or chain not finding preceding (e.g., in Train 1, 2 and 6 may not be adjacent in chain [from row 18: 2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5? wait, row 18 has 2 8 3 8 9 8 4 8 2 8 6 8 7 8 5 8 8 8 8, so chain [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5], yes 2-6 adjacent via 2-6? no direct, but 4-2 then 2-6? wait, checks pairs, so 2-6 is direct pair, preceding 2).
 * Unhelpful: No function for full vertical chain propagation across gaps; current between-section only does horizontal overlap-based, but examples need full-column patterned fills matching upper/lower patterns via chain; `detect_bg` works (8), but if grid has varying bg, it might fail.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output performs horizontal fills correctly within sections (e.g., rows 1-5 fill 4's in cols 1-5, 8's in 8-12, 9's in 20-24; rows 8-12 fill 6's cols 1-5, 7's 8-12, 4's 20-24; rows 15-19 fill 9's 1-5, 4's 8-12, 5's 14-18, 3's 20-24), and some vertical within sections (e.g., uniform across multi-rows), but leaves between-section gaps all 1's (bg here is 1?) unfilled—e.g., rows 6-7 and 13-14 all 1's, but expected likely has patterned fills like vertical extensions of 4-8-9 or 6-7-4 using chain from row 26 [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,... filtered non-1], such as filling row 6-7 with 8's where upper 8's overlap lower? but no, gaps should propagate via chain adjacencies (e.g., 4 adjacent to 6? chain has 4-7,7-6 no; but 9-4 in lower to upper).
 * It does not look correct because gaps (rows 6-7 between upper 4/8/9 section and middle 6/7/4; rows 13-14 between middle and lower 9/4/5/3; row 20? wait 20 is section start, but row 25? wait grid has 28 rows?) are unfilled, similar to training failures—expected should have vertical fills in gaps matching adjacent section colors via chain (e.g., row 6 cols 8-12 might fill 7? if 8-7 adjacent in chain, but chain has 8? row 26 has 4 1 8 1 9 etc., chain [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7], so 8-9 pair preceding 8; 4-7 pair 4, etc.), and bottom section rows 21-25 fill 7's cols 20-24 correctly but gaps above unfilled; also, bg is 1 here (all borders 1), proto 1? wait no, proto=1 but bg also 1? detection may fail since upper counts 1 as proto, but if 1 is both, max non-1 is say 4, but generated treats 1 as bg, filling over it wrongly? wait, in generated, it fills sections but leaves 1's in gaps, suggesting bg=1 detected wrong or proto=1 skips properly, but no vertical gap fills.
 * Test output misses between-section vertical propagations entirely, like trainings, and may have bg detection issue (upper rows have many 1's as proto/border, but colors like 4 appear, so bg should be absent or default, but generated fills as if 1 is bg); also, row 0 and 27 all 1's correct (borders), row 26 chain untouched, but no gap patterns (e.g., row 6 should perhaps have 8's in cols 8-12 if propagating from upper 8 to lower 7 via chain 8-9-4-7 no direct, but logic needs adjustment for non-direct? no, only adjacent pairs).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where numbers represent colors or barriers: 1 acts as walls/barriers (proto), 8 is typically background (bg), other numbers (2-9) are specific colors to propagate and fill into bg areas. The goal is to fill bg cells with appropriate colors based on connected uniform regions, vertical/horizontal propagation within wall-bounded sections, and gap-filling between sections using adjacency rules derived from a "chain" (likely a key sequence) extracted from near the bottom of the grid, ensuring shapes and separations match implied puzzle logic like nonograms or region-filling with constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into segments/regions both horizontally (within rows) and vertically (across rows); sections are defined as consecutive rows that contain some 1's but are not entirely 1's, and propagation must respect these boundaries without crossing full-1 rows or unrelated areas.
 * Background (bg, usually 8) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows; it must be filled only where a uniform color can be inferred from adjacent non-bg/non-proto cells, but never overwrite existing colors or 1's.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row, capturing non-bg/non-proto cells as a sequence of colors (e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in train1); this acts as an adjacency key—fills between regions use a color from the chain only if two adjacent regions' colors (a and b) appear next to each other in the chain, preferring the "preceding" one in the pair.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, segments between 1's (or edges) should be filled with a single color if all non-bg/non-proto cells in that segment share one color; bg cells in the segment get that color, but gaps between filled segments (still bg) get filled via chain if the bounding segments' colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a detected section (consecutive partial-1 rows), fill vertically column-by-column: if a vertical segment between 1's has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, propagate that color to all bg cells in that vertical run; do not cross 1's or section boundaries.
 * Gap filling between sections: For gaps (all-8 or partial rows) between two sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section), get their horizontal filled regions, and for overlapping column ranges between upper/lower regions with colors a/b, if a and b are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rectangle (overlapping columns, all gap rows) with the preceding color from the chain pair; only fill bg or 1's in those positions (but 1's might be subtle—avoid overwriting true walls?).
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency is bidirectional but returns the "preceding" color in the pair (e.g., if chain has ...a,b..., fill with a; if ...b,a..., fill with b); sections must exclude the last two rows (header/footer?); inner row selection picks the first row in a section with any non-1/bg, but if none, skip; do not fill if segment colors aren't uniform (len(seg_colors)==1); gaps only if gap_start <= gap_end; vertical propagation skips 1's but fills around them if uniform; chain extraction ignores bg and 1's but preserves order; in multi-row uniform blocks, ensure consistency across rows; bottom row (and possibly second-bottom) is the key and should remain unchanged; full-8 rows separate sections but aren't sections themselves; overlapping regions in gap-fill use max/min columns for projection.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal fill must happen before vertical/section detection (as in code), but gap-fill after; chain might have duplicates (e.g., two 2's in train1), so adjacency checks all pairs; if no uniform color, leave as bg; vertical fill only within section bounds, not across gaps; in train3, large sections need multi-row consistency; test grid has wider layout with more colors (3-9), so chain likely longer; do not fill the very top/bottom rows unless they fit section rules; bg detection scans only upper rows (n-2) to avoid key contamination.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding but incomplete implementation of propagation and gap-filling rules.
 * Horizontal filling worked partially: In train1, upper sections (rows 1-4) correctly filled uniform 1/2/5/7 segments between 1's, but failed to fill intra-row gaps between segments (e.g., row1 generated 1's but left 7/8 areas as 8's instead of using chain); similar in train2 (filled some 1/2/3/5/7 but left row1's 2-block incomplete) and train3 (filled multi-row 1/3/2/9 blocks but missed vertical consistency in lower sections).
 * Vertical propagation worked somewhat: In train1, it extended colors within sections (e.g., 2's and 5's in rows 2-3), but skipped or failed in wider blocks; in train2, filled rows5-7 correctly for 1/4/6/9 but not row4 gaps; in train3, extended upper 1/3/2 blocks across rows1-5 but left lower sections (rows8-11) with incomplete 4/6 fills (e.g., row9 has 6 but not propagated fully).
 * Section detection worked basically: Correctly identified partial-1 row groups (e.g., train1 sections at rows0-4 and 8-11; train2 at 0-2 and 5-7; train3 at 0-5 and 8-11 and 17-21), excluding full-8 and last two rows, but <n-2 limit missed some lower sections in train3 (e.g., rows17-21 detected but propagation incomplete).
 * Gap filling failed entirely: No fills in inter-section gaps; e.g., train1 generated all-8 rows5-7 where expected has 2/6 blocks (projected from upper/lower), and row12 all-8 vs expected 9/2; train2 row4 all-8 vs expected 3/6/7 blocks; train3 row6-7 and row12-16 all-8 vs expected 9/6 blocks—likely because get_inner returned valid rows but overlap checks (o_l > o_r) or chain adjacency failed (e.g., wrong preceding color or no match); also, perform_gap_fills skipped if no inner or gap too small.
 * Chain extraction worked: For train1, likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] matching bottom; used in horizontal but not effectively in gaps (e.g., 2 and 6 should fill with preceding if adjacent in chain, but didn't).
 * Bg detection worked: 8 correctly identified in all.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: perform_gap_fills is broken (no fills occur, possibly due to strict overlap or fill_c None; overwrites proto=1 in gaps? but shouldn't); get_filled_regions misses non-uniform post-fill; vertical_propagate_within skips too aggressively (leaves bg in multi-color verticals, but examples need uniform check); overall program modifies grid_out in-place but doesn't handle multi-section gaps or chain duplicates well; no function for full-grid uniformity check post-fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete propagation and missing gap fills similar to training failures; e.g., rows1-6 have 4's and 8's filled horizontally but no vertical extension to row6's partial 9's, and row7-8 all 1's (possibly misbg?) where gaps should project colors like 9's from above; rows8-12 fill 6/7/4 but row13 cuts 4's short (ends with 1's instead of full block), suggesting horizontal_fill failed end-segment; row15 has 9/5/3 blocks but row16 all 1's (gap unfilled, should project from row15 to row20's 3/7?); rows21-25 fill 3 then 7's but inconsistently (row21 3's full, rows22-26 7's but row26 all 1's?); bottom key row27 has 4/8/9/etc. unchanged (good), but overall lacks vertical consistency in lower half (e.g., 5/3/7 blocks not propagated up from key projections) and gap rectangles (e.g., between row12 and row14, no 4/5/3 fills); compared to training patterns, it over-relies on horizontal (matches upper 4/8/9 shapes) but misses chain-based gap/vertical for lower (e.g., expected likely has 7's extending up from row22 into row16 gap, using chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 5-7); without expected, it differs by leaving too many 1's/bg in gaps/verticals, making shapes incomplete (e.g., 4-block in row13-14 not uniform height).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where a 2D grid represents a visual scene with background cells (typically 8), wall/prototype cells (1), and partial colored regions (numbers 2-9). The goal is to propagate and fill background cells with colors based on uniformity in rows/columns, adjacency rules from a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row, and rules for filling gaps between vertically separated "sections" of the grid defined by partial wall rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg, usually 8) cells must only be filled if they can be unambiguously propagated from adjacent uniform colored segments; never overwrite existing colors, walls (proto=1), or other non-bg cells.
 * The "chain" is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, used to determine if two colors are "adjacent" (i.e., appear next to each other in the chain, in either order) for gap-filling; if so, the preceding color in the chain can fill gaps between matching segments.
 * Sections are contiguous groups of rows (up to n-2) that contain at least one proto=1 but are not entirely proto=1; these define bounded areas for vertical propagation.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, identify segments between proto walls; if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, for adjacent segments, if their colors are adjacent in the chain, fill bg gaps between them with the preceding color from the chain pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section and per column, fill bg cells in stretches between proto walls using the single uniform color in that stretch if present.
 * Inter-section filling: Between consecutive sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-proto/bg row in each section), extract uniform colored regions from those rows, find overlapping column ranges between upper and lower regions, and if the colors are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rows (between sections) in those columns with the preceding chain color—but only if both sections have valid inner rows.
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency checks must consider order (preceding color matters, not just presence); sections exclude the last two rows (n-1 and n-2 are reserved for chain/bottom); bg detection counts non-proto in upper rows (0 to n-3) to find the most common non-proto as bg; do not fill if segments have multiple colors; gap filling between sections only applies to bg cells and only in overlapping columns; empty sections or no inner row skips filling; chain may have duplicates or gaps, but adjacency is pairwise consecutive only.
 * Edge cases: All-proto rows end sections; no sections means no vertical/inter-section filling; chain may be empty (no gap filling); varying grid widths (m) and heights (n); test inputs may have larger/more complex sections; bottom two rows (including chain row) are never modified; proto=1 is fixed and blocks propagation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Horizontal filling often works for intra-row uniformity but fails on chain-based gap filling if is_adjacent_preceding returns wrong preceding color; vertical propagation misses if sections are misidentified (e.g., including all-proto rows); inter-section filling fails if inner rows are not correctly selected (e.g., picking a row with no non-bg cells) or if overlap detection ignores partial overlaps; bg detection assumes upper rows, but if grid is small (n<3), chain/extractions return empty; no handling for multiple chains or non-standard proto/bg; fillings can cascade (horizontal then vertical then inter-section), so order matters.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it implements a full pipeline (bg detection, chain extraction, horizontal/vertical filling, section-based inter-filling) showing partial understanding of propagation rules.
 * Horizontal filling works correctly for uniform segments in rows (e.g., fills 1-regions around 2/5/7 in ex1 rows 2-3) but fails chain-based gaps (e.g., doesn't fill between 7 and 1 in ex1 row1 correctly, leaving extra 1's unfilled? Wait, actually overfills some 7's into bg areas).
 * Vertical propagation succeeds in sections for uniform columns (e.g., fills 5's vertically in ex1) but misses if sections are wrong (e.g., in ex3, doesn't fill lower vertical stacks like 6's in rows 13-17).
 * Section finding is mostly correct (identifies partial-wall groups) but excludes last two rows properly; however, inter-section gap filling fails entirely—e.g., in ex1, gaps between sections (rows 5-7) remain all bg instead of filling 2's and 6's based on chain adjacency from upper/lower inners; similarly, row12 gap unfilled for 9's/2's.
 * In ex2, horizontal fills some (e.g., 2/5/7 in row2) but misses vertical in sections and all inter-section (row4 remains bg, expected 3/6/7); chain extraction works but not applied between sections.
 * In ex3, fills upper sections horizontally/vertically (e.g., 3/2 in rows1-4) but misses many lower fillings (e.g., rows7-12 partial, rows13-17 all bg instead of 6's, rows18-22 unfilled 1-regions); inter-section skips due to no inner or overlap issues.
 * Bg detection works (identifies 8 correctly); chain extraction is accurate but underused (adjacency only for horizontal, not fully for vertical/gaps).
 * Overall, intra-section filling (horizontal/vertical) partially succeeds (~50% in ex1/3), but inter-section logic broken (no gap fills observed); no overfilling of proto or bottom rows, but underfilling dominates.
 * Function `get_inner` is helpful but fragile (returns first non-proto/bg row, but if none, skips—happens in ex1 row12?); `get_filled_regions` good for extracting uniform segments but only used post-horizontal, so misses if horizontal incomplete.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `horizontal_fill` has redundant comps building (could fill in one pass); entire inter-section loop assumes consecutive sections only and max/min overlap, but doesn't handle non-overlapping or multi-region overlaps well (e.g., ex3 complex widths).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows large uniform blocks filled (e.g., rows1-5 all 4's in cols1-5, 8's in cols8-12, 9's in cols20-24; rows8-12 6's/7's/4's; rows15-19 9's/4's/5's/3's; rows21-25 7's), with horizontal propagation seeming applied but vertical/inter-section incomplete (e.g., rows6-7 and13-14 all 1's suggest no gap filling between sections; bottom row28 has scattered colors but row27 all 1's unfilled).
 * It matches a pattern of filling wide uniform regions but leaves potential section gaps as 1's (which may be proto, but expected likely fills bg=1? Wait, test uses 1 as bg/proto? Confusion: test grid has 1 as bg/proto, differing from training's 8/1—program hardcodes proto=1, detects bg=1? But output fills over 1's incorrectly, e.g., row1 all 1's unfilled but should propagate if sections present.
 * Differences: Overfills entire blocks without wall respect (e.g., rows1-5 ignore potential proto in input); misses vertical uniformity (e.g., col1 all 1's/4's/6's/9's but not propagated down sections); chain-based gaps not filled (e.g., between row5-6 and row12-13, remains 1's); bottom row28 has 4/8/9/... but no propagation to row27; overall, looks like horizontal-only filling on assumed input sections, ignoring inter-section rules—does not match expected full propagation seen in training diffs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling of background areas (likely 8 in training examples, 1 in test) using rules based on "prototype" walls (fixed as 1), sections of rows with partial walls, and a "chain" of colors extracted from near the bottom row to determine valid adjacencies for filling gaps horizontally, vertically within sections, and between sections. The goal is to fill unknown/background cells with colors that maintain connectivity and adjacency rules derived from the chain, without overfilling or violating section boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (proto=1) acts as walls that divide rows into segments; sections are groups of consecutive rows (excluding top 2 and bottom 2?) that contain some but not all 1's, used for vertical propagation.
 * Background (bg) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in the top rows (excluding last 2); in training it's 8, but test uses 1 as apparent bg/walls interchangeably, suggesting code's fixed proto=1 may not generalize if inputs vary.
 * Chain is extracted from the second-to-last row, keeping only non-bg non-proto cells; used to check "adjacent preceding" pairs (if a and b are neighbors in chain or swapped, return the first/preceding one as fill color).
 * Horizontal filling: Within rows, fill bg gaps between walls if the segment has exactly one color; then bridge gaps between filled segments using chain adjacency if colors match a valid pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section, for each column, fill bg in vertical runs bounded by walls if the run has exactly one non-bg color, but skip edges if at section boundaries.
 * Between sections: Identify "inner" rows (first non-proto non-bg row in section), get horizontal filled regions, find overlapping column ranges between upper/lower sections' regions, and fill bg in the gap rows between sections using chain adjacency of the region colors.
 * Subtlety: Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color (first in pair); if a==b, return a directly.
 * Easy to miss: Sections exclude rows that are all-proto or no-proto; filling only happens if exactly one color in segment (avoids mixing); vertical fill skips boundary rows in sections to avoid over-propagation; between-sections fill only in overlapping columns and only if adjacency exists.
 * Chain may have duplicates or order matters for "preceding"; no filling if no valid adjacency or no overlap.
 * Gaps between sections only filled if inner rows exist and regions align; entire grid copy to avoid mutating input.
 * Potential issue: Code assumes n>=3, fixed proto=1; may fail if bg==1 or variable protos; doesn't handle empty sections or single-row sections well.
 * All training examples have a bottom chain row (row 25) with isolated colors separated by bg, likely the key for adjacencies (e.g., 3,2,9,4,6,7).

 * This is the last (and only shown) submission; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating core horizontal filling, chain extraction, and basic vertical propagation work for simple cases without between-section gaps or complex overlaps.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated incorrectly filled row 2 with 3's in columns 6-8 (where expected has 8's/bg) and 2's in 14-16 (expected 8's); row 6 lacks the isolated 9 in column 19 (expected has it, generated has 1? but shown as 1's); rows 12-16 have all 8's in column 11 where expected has 6's (failed vertical propagation or section detection); row 7 has no 9, and lower sections missed 6's entirely—likely due to flawed between-sections filling or inner row selection not capturing isolated colors.
 * Horizontal_fill worked partially (filled 1's correctly in many places) but overfilled bridges using chain (e.g., 1-3 adjacency assumed but not valid, or chain order wrong).
 * Vertical_propagate_within seems broken for training 3: Didn't propagate 6's downward in column 11 across rows 12-16, possibly because sections weren't detected correctly or fill_start/end skipped too much.
 * Between-sections logic in main program failed: For gap around row 6-7, didn't place the 9; for lower gaps, missed propagating 6's—likely inner_u/inner_l selection wrong (get_inner returns first non-empty row, but may need all or different), or overlap detection (o_s/o_e) too strict, or no adjacency in chain for relevant pairs.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are helpful but subtle: get_inner picks first valid row, which may miss if sections have varying inner rows; get_filled_regions identifies uniform segments correctly but only if already horizontally filled.
 * find_sections likely missed sections in training 3 (e.g., rows with isolated protos not grouped), leading to no vertical fill for 6's.
 * Overall, code handles single-section or no-gap cases (training 1/2) but breaks on multi-section with isolated colors and gaps (training 3); chain adjacency may not handle non-consecutive pairs or duplicates well.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all shown are relevant, but vertical_propagate_within and between-sections loop need debugging for edge cases like single-cell regions or boundary skips.

**Test output:**
 * The test generated output appears mostly correct at a glance but has potential issues: It propagates colors like 2,4,8,9 horizontally/vertically within apparent sections (e.g., rows 1-5 have consistent blocks of 4's and 8's/9's), and bridges some using likely chain (e.g., row 15 has 2's extended to columns 14-18 and 20-24, suggesting adjacency fill); lower sections (rows 16-20) fill 9/4/5/3 blocks vertically across 3 rows, which matches vertical propagation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Row 8 is all 1's (bg?), but if it's a separator, expected might have partial fills; row 21 has 2's in 20-24 but input/generated shows consistent filling—unknown if overfills (e.g., row 15's middle 2's in 14-18/20-24 may bridge incorrectly if chain doesn't allow 2-2 self-adjacency across gap). Rows 22-25 have 7's propagated vertically but only in 20-24, and row 26 all 1's—seems correct, but row 27 (chain?) has isolated colors without filling around them, which matches rules (no fill in chain row).
 * Bottom row 28 all 1's expected; the isolated colors in row 27 (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) likely form the chain, and output didn't alter them, which is good—but upper fills (e.g., 6's in rows 9-12 columns 1-5) propagated down correctly, but row 15's 2's extension to column 14-18/20-24 might be wrong if no direct chain adjacency (unknown without input chain order).
 * Key difference: Test input (inferred from output patterns) has wider grid (29 cols?) with more sections; code filled most but possibly missed between-section gaps (e.g., rows 6-7/13-14 all 1's, no cross-fills shown); looks 80% correct but subtle overfills in row 15 suggest chain adjacency misapplied (e.g., self-adjacency for 2's allowed but maybe only for distinct pairs).
 * To handle test: Need to verify chain order matches bottom isolated (e.g., if chain is 4-8-9-... , then 2-4 adjacency might fill, but 2 self-bridge in gaps may be invalid); output makes sense overall but not perfect—account for larger m and more sections.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where background areas (bg) are filled with colors based on propagation rules within and between sections delimited by prototype walls (value 1), using horizontal filling of uniform segments, vertical propagation inside sections, and inter-section filling guided by overlapping colored regions and an adjacency chain extracted from near the bottom of the grid. The chain represents a sequence of colors that determines allowable fills between adjacent but separated colors (a and b can be bridged by a preceding color in the chain if they appear adjacent in it).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (1) acts as walls/barriers that segment the grid into sections; sections are identified by consecutive rows that contain some but not all 1s (mixed proto and non-proto).
 * Background (bg, often 0 or unfilled) is filled only if a segment/region has exactly one non-bg, non-proto color; multi-color segments are not filled.
 * Horizontal filling occurs first across all non-bottom rows, unifying bg in uniform-color gaps between 1s and bridging gaps between adjacent uniform segments if their colors are "adjacent" in the chain (i.e., appear next to each other in chain, filling with the preceding one).
 * Vertical propagation happens only within each section (between section start/end), filling bg in columns if the vertical segment in that column has exactly one color; it expands to cover the min-max range of that color's positions but skips over 1s.
 * Inter-section filling targets gaps between consecutive sections (rows from upper section end+1 to lower start-1), but only in columns where upper and lower "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section) have overlapping uniform colored regions; fill uses chain adjacency, and only bg is overwritten.
 * Chain extraction is from the second-to-last row (n-2), collecting non-bg, non-proto values in order, skipping 1s— this row often contains the "key" sequence of isolated colors separated by 1s.
 * Adjacency check in chain is symmetric (a then b or b then a) but returns the preceding color for filling; if a==b, use a directly.
 * Bottom two rows (n-1 and possibly n-2) are treated specially: n-1 is all 1s or bg, n-2 provides chain; no filling applied to bottom rows.
 * Subtle: "Inner" row for a section is the first row within it that has any non-1, non-bg; if none, skip inter-fill for that section pair.
 * Subtle: Overlap for inter-fill is strict (max start to min end of regions); no fill if no overlap or no chain link.
 * Edge cases: Empty sections, single-row sections, full-proto rows (not sections), grids with n<2 (return as-is), or chain with duplicates/self-adjacencies.
 * No overwriting of existing non-bg colors; only bg is filled. Sections must have mixed rows (some 1s but not all) to qualify—pure non-proto rows aren't sections for vertical prop.
 * Propagation doesn't cross sections vertically or use chain for intra-section fills; chain is only for horizontal bridges and inter-section gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(This extracts the color sequence from the penultimate row, ignoring bg and proto—essential for determining fill colors between adjacent regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(This checks chain for adjacency and returns the bridging color—core for all fill decisions; handles self-match directly.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    n = len(grid)
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(len(grid[0])))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as consecutive rows up to n-2 with partial proto coverage—key for scoping vertical and inter-fills; excludes bottom rows.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    # (as provided in attempt; fills uniform segments between protos with their single color, and bridges gaps between adjacent segments using chain)
```
(Helpful for initial horizontal unification across all rows.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    # (as provided; fills vertical bg segments within a section/column if single color present, expanding to min-max of that color)
```
(Helpful for intra-section vertical filling, but note it skips protos and only acts on bg.)

```python
def get_inner(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # (as provided; finds first row in section with any non-proto non-bg for inter-section reference)
```
(Helpful for selecting representative rows for overlap in inter-fills.)

```python
def get_filled_regions(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # (as provided; extracts uniform single-color segments between protos in a row, ignoring bg)
```
(Helpful for identifying regions in inner rows for overlap checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, indicating solid implementation of horizontal filling, section detection, vertical propagation within sections, and basic inter-section filling via chain.
 * What worked: Chain extraction accurately pulls the key sequence; horizontal_fill unifies bg in uniform gaps and bridges via chain adjacency; vertical_propagate_within properly scopes to sections and fills single-color verticals without crossing walls; section finding skips bottom rows and pure rows correctly.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, large areas are over-filled with 2 (likely from chain having many 2s or self-adjacency), but isolated higher numbers (e.g., 4,8,9 in rows 3,10,17) are preserved as "seeds" without surrounding fills, suggesting incomplete propagation around them—expected more bridging if chain allows (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 4 in chain, gaps near 4 should fill with preceding color, but appear as bg or unfilled in output? Wait, output shows 2s around them, but perhaps not vertically between sections).
 * Missed potential: Inter-section filling seems limited; in test output, the lower section (rows ~20-25) has 2s only on the right, with left all 1s, but if overlaps exist with upper sections' inner rows (which have scattered 4,8,etc.), more fills expected in gaps (rows 11-16? appear all 2s, but row 17 has mixed—perhaps sections misidentified).
 * extract_chain is essential and correct (pulls from n-2, which in test output became [1,4,1,8,...] after fills? No, chain extracted before fills, so from input's n-2).
 * horizontal_fill is helpful but may over-apply bridges if chain has long 2-2 sequences, leading to uniform 2 floods.
 * vertical_propagate_within is mostly correct but in test, columns with mixed seeds (e.g., col 3 has 4 in row3, 6 in row10, 9 in row17) aren't unified vertically across sections, which is intended (only within), but gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) remain 2-filled horizontally, potentially correct if no overlap trigger.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are essential for inter-fills but may fail if inner row is all bg after horizontal (test output has inner rows with seeds like row3, so okay); however, overlaps might be too narrow, missing wider fills.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though find_sections excludes i >= n-2 strictly, which is good but subtle if input has proto in bottom.

**Test output:**
 * The test output fills most of the grid with 2s in large horizontal bands (e.g., rows 1-2,4-9,11-16,18-20,22-23,25-26), preserving isolated higher colors (4,8,9 in row3; 6,7,4 in row10; 9,4,2,5,3 in row17; 7 in row23) surrounded by 2s or 1s, which makes sense if 2 is a dominant chain color and seeds are non-propagated starts.
 * It looks partially correct: Bottom row all 1s (untouched), second-last all 1s (perhaps input was mixed, but filled to proto? No, code doesn't fill bottom), chain row (row 27 in output) has isolated 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7 separated by 1s, matching expected chain preservation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 20-25) has 2s only in columns 20-24, with left side all 1s—no vertical propagation or inter-fill into left bg areas, suggesting missed overlaps with upper mixed rows (e.g., row17 has colors up to col23, should overlap and fill gaps above row20 if chain links, but remains 1/bg? Output shows 1s, implying no fill triggered—perhaps get_inner picks a row without left colors).
 * Gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) are fully 2-filled horizontally, which seems correct if upper/lower inners overlap in cols 3,10,22 (where seeds are) and chain has 2-4/2-8 etc., but vertically in those columns, bg above/below seeds isn't filled (e.g., col3 row4=2, but if vertical prop within section, why not extend from seed? Sections may not include seed rows if they are full-mixed).
 * Row 0 and row 28 all 1s (top/bottom borders, correct untouched). Row 21 all 1s? Wait, output row20 is mixed 1s and 2s on right—looks like partial section. Overall, over-reliance on 2 suggests chain starts/bridges with 2, but scattered seeds in row17 (cols 3,9,11,15-16,18,22) aren't bridged horizontally in that row (gaps are 2s, but if multi-color, no fill—correct, but expected more inter-fill below).
 * The output makes sense for a 2-dominant fill but misses potential fills in left-lower areas and between scattered seeds, differing from expectation of fuller propagation if sections/overlaps are broader; unknown if input had more bg in lower left, but output leaves it as 1s (proto? or bg not filled—code sets bg to colors, but if input 1s, untouched).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a walled structure (using 1 as proto/walls) with background (likely 0) and colored regions (numbers like 2,3,4,...), where the goal is to fill empty background areas horizontally and vertically based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a key row near the bottom of the grid. The filling propagates colors between wall-separated regions only if the bordering colors are adjacent in the chain sequence, using the preceding or matching color from the chain to decide the fill color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is identified from the last row's first cell, assumed to be 0 or empty; all fills target only bg cells without overwriting existing colors or walls.
 * The chain is a sequence of non-bg colors extracted from the second-to-last row (grid[n-2]), representing an ordering of colors that defines valid adjacencies for filling (e.g., colors must appear consecutively in the chain to allow propagation between regions).
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into sections both vertically (stacks of wall rows) and horizontally (within rows); sections are contiguous blocks of rows with at least one proto in them.
 * Vertical filling occurs between non-adjacent vertical sections (with gap rows in between) by identifying "inner" rows in each section (first non-pure-proto/bg row), extracting uniform-color regions in those inners, and filling overlapping horizontal spans in the gap rows with a color from the chain if the bordering region colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling happens within individual rows, between consecutive walls, filling bg in uniform-color regions if bordering colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Subtlety: Regions must be uniform single-color (no mixed colors within a wall-bounded segment) to be considered for filling; scattered same-color cells in a segment don't qualify unless contiguous (code uses min/max j of js, but assumes uniformity).
 * Adjacency in chain is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color based on order (if a then b, return a; if b then a, return b), which might imply directionality in propagation (e.g., fill with the earlier-in-chain color).
 * Easy to miss: Vertical sections skip the last two rows (while i < n-2), assuming the chain and bg rows are at the bottom and not part of sections; inner rows are chosen as the first row in a section with non-proto/bg content.
 * Gaps between sections must have no overlap in filling logic; if sections are adjacent (end1 +1 >= start2), no vertical fill.
 * Chain extraction ignores bg and proto, but assumes the row has meaningful sequence; if chain <2 elements, no filling.
 * Overwriting only bg; existing colors (like special numbers 3-9) stay, so fills don't propagate over pre-placed colors.
 * Grid dimensions: Assumes rectangular (n rows, m cols); early returns if n<3.
 * Potential edge case: Multiple regions per inner row; filling only where horizontal overlaps exist between upper/lower regions.
 * Chain may include duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's), allowing multiple adjacencies; is_adjacent_preceding checks for exact pairs in sequence, not just presence.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it successfully handled all three training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating solid core logic for basic vertical and horizontal filling between wall sections using chain adjacencies.
 * Worked well for identifying bg (0), extracting chain from second-last row, and finding vertical sections excluding bottom two rows.
 * Vertical fill correctly skips adjacent sections and only fills gaps where inner-row regions overlap horizontally and colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Horizontal fill properly identifies regions between walls in rows and fills if adjacent in chain, but only within the same row.
 * What didn't work/may be limited: get_inner_row picks only the first valid row in a section, potentially missing multi-row sections with varying inner content; if a section has no qualifying inner row (all proto/bg), skips entirely.
 * get_regions requires strictly uniform single color per inter-wall segment (set len==1), which works if regions are solid but may fail if input has pre-filled partials or mixed bg/colors; it also takes min/max of js but doesn't ensure full coverage (e.g., holes in region ignored).
 * is_adjacent_preceding is symmetric but biased toward the order in chain (returns the first in pair), which succeeded in training but might not handle reverse propagation or multi-hop chains.
 * No extraction of "objects" per se (e.g., full blobs or connected components); focuses on wall-bounded regions, which is helpful but assumes walls define all boundaries—may miss open areas without walls.
 * horizontal_fill re-extracts regions per row (redundant with get_regions) and uses index k of walls for positioning, which is functional but inefficient; it fills only between consecutive regions in the same row.
 * vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are applied sequentially (vert then horiz), which may overwrite or miss interactions if horiz creates new adjacencies for vert (but since copies grid, it's one-pass).
 * No handling for chain colors not present in regions (fills only if exact match); assumes proto=1 fixed, bg dynamic.
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of wall-section-chain rules but may underfill in complex test cases with multi-layer sections or non-uniform inners.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from lists) with heavy use of 1's as walls/borders, large areas filled with 2's (likely the dominant chain color), and isolated special colors (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) placed in specific positions across rows 3,10,17,23, matching a pattern like staggered "key" placements vertically aligned with the bottom chain row 27: [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,...].
 * It looks partially correct: Upper sections (rows 0-6,8-13) are mostly 2-filled between walls with specials like 4,8,9,6,7,4 in row 3/10, suggesting vertical propagation of 2's where adjacent to chain (assuming 2 is prevalent in chain), and specials are preserved (not overwritten).
 * Middle section (rows 15-19) has expanded 2's in central columns (14-19) with specials 9,4,5,3, indicating horizontal/vertical fills triggered by chain adjacencies (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 9/4/5/3, fill 2 in overlaps).
 * Lower sections (rows 21-25) have narrower 2-fills (columns 20-24) with 7 in row 23, showing localized filling, possibly due to narrower wall sections or no overlap with upper regions.
 * What doesn't look correct: Many areas remain as 1's or potentially unfilled (though output shows no explicit 0's, assuming bg was 0 and filled to 2's where possible); for example, rows 1-2,4-5, etc., mirror row structures but fill only 2's around specials without propagating the specials themselves upward/downward—e.g., the 4 in row 3 col 3 isn't filled vertically into row 2 col 3 (still 2?), suggesting vertical_fill didn't trigger for that pair (perhaps no chain adjacency between 4 and bordering 2, or no gap/overlap). Similarly, central expansions in rows 15-19 seem correct, but lower partial fills (only cols 20-24) differ from upper full-width 2's, possibly missing vertical propagation across full horizontal span if chain doesn't support wider overlaps. Bottom rows 26-28 are all 1's except the chain in 27, which is preserved correctly. Overall, it makes sense for a chain-heavy-2 puzzle but appears incomplete in propagating specials (e.g., no 4/8/9 fills beyond their input positions), which might be expected if the puzzle requires filling gaps with adjacent chain colors including specials; unknown if input had these specials pre-placed or if filling should expand them—differs from expectation of fuller special propagation if chain allows (e.g., if 4 adjacent to 2, why not fill more 4's?).

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 21:57:30] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where a background color (e.g., 8 or 1) represents empty space to be filled with colored regions (numbers 2-9), guided by walls (prototype value, often 1), a chain of colors extracted from a specific row (second-to-last), and rules for propagating fills horizontally within rows, vertically within sections bounded by walls, and across gaps between sections based on adjacency in the chain. The goal is to extend uniform color regions into adjacent background spaces while respecting wall boundaries and chain-based connections for bridging sections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection: The background is the most common non-prototype color in the top n-2 rows; if none, fall back to the last row's first cell. This works for uniform backgrounds like 8 or 1 but may fail if backgrounds vary or if prototypes dominate early rows.
 * Chain extraction: Colors are pulled exclusively from the second-to-last row (index n-2), excluding background and prototype; this acts as a "key" sequence for adjacency checks but ignores the actual last row (which seems to be a fixed chain of single colors separated by background in examples, e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in ex1).
 * Sections: Defined as contiguous row ranges (from 0 to n-3) where rows contain some but not all prototypes (1s as walls); pure prototype or pure non-prototype rows end sections. This identifies "puzzle areas" but misses sections that span full prototype rows or have no prototypes.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, identify segments between prototype walls, fill background in uniform-color segments with that color, then bridge gaps between adjacent uniform segments if their colors are adjacent in the chain (using is_adjacent_preceding, which checks for direct neighbors in chain and returns the preceding color). Subtlety: Only fills background, not overwriting existing colors; adjacency is symmetric but returns the first in pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section and per column, fill background in vertical runs bounded by prototypes if the run has exactly one non-background/non-prototype color. This extends colors downward/upward but only within section bounds and doesn't handle multi-color runs or propagation across sections.
 * Gap filling between sections: For consecutive sections, identify an "inner" row (first non-empty non-proto/bg row in section), get uniform horizontal regions there, then for overlapping column ranges of regions with colors adjacent in chain, fill background in the row gap with the preceding chain color. Subtleties: Only if both sections have valid inners; overlaps must align column-wise; doesn't propagate vertically in gaps or handle non-overlapping regions; assumes sections are vertically stacked without horizontal offsets.
 * Overall: Fills are done in phases (all horizontal first, then vertical per section, then gaps); output is a copy of input with only background replaced. Easy to miss: Chain is unordered for adjacency (just checks pairs, not sequence position); no diagonal or multi-step propagation; last row is ignored for filling/extraction; prototypes (1) are never filled/overwritten; in test cases, background is 1 and prototypes may be absent or different.
 * Across attempts: Programs assume fixed proto=1 and chain from n-2; miss full last-row integration (e.g., expected uses last row for gap colors like 2/6 in ex1 rows 5-7); overfill or underfill horizontals if segments aren't uniform; verticals don't cross section gaps; gaps only fill if exact column overlap and chain adjacency.

```

The following functions are broken or not helpful: get_inner (picks arbitrary first non-empty row in section, but ignores if all bg/proto—leads to skipped gaps); get_filled_regions (recomputes uniform segments post-fill, but redundant with horizontal_fill and misses non-uniform); overall program (phasing is good but gap logic too rigid, e.g., requires exact overlap and doesn't use last row chain).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, with partial horizontal/vertical fills but missing gap bridges and section extensions using the last row chain.
 * Train 1: Generated filled horizontals in puzzle rows (e.g., row1: 1s expanded, row2: 2s/5s/7s correct) and some verticals (e.g., 7s in row3-4 col11-13), but failed to fill gaps between sections—e.g., rows5-7 all bg except edges, but expected 2s in col2-3 and 6s in col15-16 from last-row chain adjacency (2 follows 1? unknown why missed); row12 has 9s but expected 9s col8-9 and 2s col15-16; also overfilled row1 col11-14 with 7s where expected bg/8s. Sections likely misidentified, skipping gap fill.
 * Train 2: Generated some horizontals (e.g., row1: 1s and 2s partial) but underfilled verticals/gaps—e.g., row4 all bg, but expected 3/6/7 singles in cols6/10/14 from last row; row5-7 partial 1s/4s/6s/9s but missed extensions into bg; vertical prop didn't trigger due to multi-color or section bounds. Chain adjacency not applied across the empty section (rows4).
 * Train 3: Generated horizontals in upper sections (e.g., rows1-5: 3s/2s/9s expanded) and lower (rows8-12: 4s partial), but missed vertical extensions in lower sections (e.g., rows13-17 all bg, expected 6s in col11 across rows13-17 from chain?); rows18-22 partial 1s but no fills into bg for 8s; huge gap (rows6-7 and 13-17) unfilled, expected 9 in row6 col19 and 6s in rows13-17 col11. Section finding skipped pure bg rows, blocking propagation.
 * extract_chain useful but incomplete—uses n-2 row, but examples suggest last row ([2,3,4,6,5,7,9,...]) is the true chain for adjacency/gap colors (e.g., ex1 fills 2/6 from positions near 1s).
 * horizontal_fill works for intra-row but not applied post-vertical, missing iterative fills.
 * vertical_propagate_within good for within-section but doesn't handle inter-section or use chain for vertical gaps.
 * Gap logic in program fails due to get_inner picking wrong rows or no overlap (e.g., ex1 sections at 0-4 and 8-11, gap rows5-7 unfilled as inners don't align for 2/6 from chain).
 * find_sections misses pure non-proto sections (e.g., ex2 row4 bg, treated as gap not section).
 * Overall: Understanding of phases/adjacency is there, but last-row chain integration missing; no iteration for propagating fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It performs horizontal fills well (e.g., rows1-5: 4s expanded left, 8s middle, 9s right; rows8-12: 6s/7s/4s; rows15-19: 9s/4s/5s/3s; rows22-26: 7s), and some vertical consistency (e.g., 4s stack in rows1-5 cols1-5). However, it does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagation across apparent section gaps (e.g., rows6-7 and 13-14 all 1s/bg, unfilled, but if sections are rows0-5/7-12/14-19/21-26, gaps should bridge using chain adjacency, e.g., potentially filling 8/7/4 transitions with preceding colors like 9 or 5? unknown exact chain from last-but-one row); row27 has singles (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) like last row in trains, suggesting it's the chain source, but output doesn't use it to fill upward gaps (e.g., row21 all 1s unfilled). Also, edges are 1s (bg?), but no fills into surrounding 1s where colors touch chain positions. Differs from expected logic in trains by over-relying on horizontals without gap/vertical bridges, leaving empty sections (e.g., rows6-7/13-14/20-21 all 1s, should likely propagate from adjacent blocks like 4-to-6 or 7-to-4 via chain).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 21:57:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a consistent background color like 8 or 1), where the goal appears to be filling or extending colored regions (blobs) upwards from a "chain" or key row near the bottom, based on adjacency rules and connections through outlined structures (likely using a proto/outline color like 1). The filling propagates colors from the chain into background areas, but only where components are adjacent in the chain and connect properly through the grid's outlined shapes, without overfilling or ignoring vertical extensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is consistently the dominant filler (e.g., 8 in training examples 1 and 2, 1 in example 3 and test), identified from the bottom-left of the last row; all empty spaces start as bg.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row (n-2), filtering non-bg cells to form a sequence of colors that serves as a key for filling; positions in the chain matter for adjacency (e.g., colors at positions differing by 1 are adjacent).
 * "Proto" is the outline color (e.g., 1), found in rows above the chain by identifying rows with exactly one non-bg color; this acts as a boundary or connector, and fillings should not overwrite proto but can bridge through gaps in proto-outlined regions.
 * Components in each row (i < n-2) are contiguous non-bg segments; for each row, identify sub-components (groups of same-color cells), excluding bg and proto, and assign a primary color (proto if no other, or the dominant non-proto/bg color).
 * Filling occurs only between adjacent components in the same row if their colors are adjacent in the chain (checked via position proximity in chain, e.g., any pair of positions abs(diff)==1); gaps are filled with the chain's color at the minimal position of the adjacent pair.
 * Subtlety: Filling is horizontal within rows but must account for vertical propagation or extension from the chain upwards, especially into all-bg areas directly above chain positions (e.g., creating vertical blobs like 2x3 in train1 rows 6-7); the current program only fills horizontally and skips proto-adjacent cases, missing these verticals.
 * Do not fill if either component involves proto (current skip condition is too broad: "if comps[k][2] == proto or comps[k + 1][2] == proto: continue"), which prevents necessary bridging.
 * Chain adjacency check uses all positions of a color (pos1 + pos2), finding min_p for fill color, but fails if colors appear multiple times non-adjacently; this works for simple cases but misses multi-occurrence logic.
 * Grids have varying widths (20 in train1/2, 27 in train3, 29 in test); ensure m = len(grid[0]) handles this.
 * Outlined shapes (e.g., 1's forming boundaries around inner colors like 2,3,4) suggest enclosed regions that should be filled consistently with chain colors, but only where connected vertically/horizontally without crossing outlines.
 * Last two rows are fixed (chain in n-2, bg in n-1); processing only affects rows 0 to n-3.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical stacking of fillings (e.g., expected train1 has 3-row vertical 2's and 6's in rows 6-8, but generated has none); program doesn't propagate upwards iteratively.
 * No diagonal connections; only orthogonal (horizontal in row, vertical implied by chain position).
 * Colors 2-9 are fillers; 1/8 often bg or proto, but bg varies per grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program has a core structure for grid copying, bg/chain/proto extraction, and component finding, which is partially helpful but buggy in filling logic. No separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the inline component extraction (finding contiguous non-bg positions, grouping by color) is useful as a starting point for identifying blobs.

```python
# Helpful inline snippet from program: Extract chain (adaptable)
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    return [grid[n-2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n-2][j] != bg]

# Helpful inline snippet: Find proto (outline color)
def find_proto(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> int:
    for row in grid[:-2]:
        non_bg_set = {c for c in row if c != bg}
        if len(non_bg_set) == 1:
            return next(iter(non_bg_set))
    return None  # Or default to common value like 1

# Helpful inline snippet: Find components in a row (but buggy for colors; extend to vertical)
def find_row_components(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[tuple]:
    non_bg_pos = [j for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] != bg]
    if not non_bg_pos:
        return []
    comps = []
    j = 0
    while j < len(non_bg_pos):
        start_j = non_bg_pos[j]
        end_j = start_j
        j += 1
        while j < len(non_bg_pos) and non_bg_pos[j] == end_j + 1:
            end_j += 1
            j += 1
        vals = {grid[i][k] for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
        colors = [v for v in vals if v != bg and v != proto]
        comp_color = colors[0] if colors else proto
        comps.append((start_j, end_j, comp_color))
    return comps
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1,2,3) resulted in INCORRECT outputs; the program correctly identifies bg, chain, and proto in most cases but fails to produce expected vertical extensions/fillings above the chain.
 * Train1 generated: Horizontal fillings in rows 2-3 (e.g., 2's,5's,7's match expected) and 9-10 (3's,9's,6's match), but missed vertical blobs in rows 6-7 (expected 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17; generated all 8's) and row 13 (expected 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; generated 8's there, with misplaced 9's/2's elsewhere? Wait, row13 generated has 1's but no 9's/2's in expected positions).
 * Train1 differences: Expected has isolated vertical stacks (e.g., rows 6-8 all identical with 2's and 6's extending from chain positions 1 and 15), but generated leaves them as bg; also row13 expected has 9's/2's but generated has only 1's in outline positions without inner fill.
 * Train2 generated: Correctly preserves outlines (1's) and some inners (e.g., row2 2's/3's/5's/7's match), but misses vertical extensions in row4 (expected 3 in col6, 6 in col10, 7 in col14; generated all 8's); no changes to row6 (7's/4's/6's/9's match expected, but verticals absent).
 * Train2 differences: Expected row4 has single-cell verticals directly above chain positions (e.g., 3 above chain's 3 at col3), but generated has no such fills; program doesn't handle single-cell or vertical propagation.
 * Train3 generated: Matches some horizontal inners (e.g., row3 3's/2's/9's, row10 6's/4's match expected), but misses vertical extensions in row6 (expected 9 in col19; generated 8's), rows13-17 (expected 6's in col11 across 5 rows; generated no 6's there, instead scattered in row10), and row19 (expected 7 in col12; generated 8's? Wait, row19 generated has 7 but in wrong spot? Actually, lower rows in generated have misplaced 6's and 7's in rows13-17 but not matching expected vertical stack).
 * Train3 differences: Expected has tall vertical 6's (rows13-17 col11) extending from chain, and single 9 in row6 col19, but generated has short/horizontal 6's in row10 and no verticals; also row20 generated has 7 in row19 col11 but expected in col12? (unknown exact mismatch, but positions off); program overfills or misplaces in lower sections.
 * Overall: Component finding works for horizontal contiguous groups, but filling logic only applies horizontal gap-fills between components (e.g., works for row2 in train1 where 2's are connected), skips too many cases involving proto, and entirely misses vertical propagation from chain (key failure across all trains).
 * Chain adjacency check is helpful but underused; it correctly identifies adjacent colors (e.g., 2 and 3 adjacent in chain pos1-3), but fill color choice (chain[min_p]) doesn't extend vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the filling loop is broken (only horizontal, no iteration over rows bottom-up for propagation); avoid direct gap-filling without vertical check.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills horizontal inners in outlined regions (e.g., row3 has 4's/8's/9's in expected-like positions, row10 has 6's/7's/4's), and adds some verticals (e.g., rows15-20 have 2's in cols14-18 and 23-27, matching potential chain extensions), but overall does not look fully correct.
 * Issues: Row3 generated has 4's in cols6-7/8-9? But test input has 4's already in col6-8? Wait, input row3 has 4's in 6-8 and 9? No, input: row3 [1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,1,...] so generated keeps but doesn't extend; expected likely needs vertical fills like in trains (e.g., above chain positions for 4/8/9).
 * Missing vertical stacks: Similar to trains, no clear 3-5 row verticals above chain (e.g., input chain row27 [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,1,1,...]; expected probably vertical 4's/8's/etc. in cols above positions 1,3,5,... but generated has scattered 2's in rows15-20 cols14+ without matching chain colors).
 * Overfills or mismatches: Row17 generated has 9/4/5/3 in cols3,6-7,12-13,16,20-21,24 but input has them as singles; likely shouldn't connect horizontally across outlines (1's); looks like program filled gaps incorrectly, creating unintended bridges.
 * Rows21-25 generated have 2's in cols20-24, extending vertically, which might be correct if chain has adjacent 2's, but test input chain has no 2's (all singles separated by 1's), so probably incorrect propagation.
 * Bottom rows (26-28) untouched, correct; but upper sections (e.g., rows0-6) have no changes beyond input, missing potential fills.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails verticals and overfills gaps, similar to train failures; does not account for chain's spaced singles needing isolated vertical drops rather than horizontal merges.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where regions bounded by prototype walls (1) and background (typically 8) are filled with colors (2-9) by propagating single-color dominance within segments, vertically within wall-defined sections, and horizontally/vertically across section gaps if colors are adjacent in a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row; the goal is to complete the grid without overfilling or misapplying rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows (0 to n-3), but only if present; empty grids return unchanged.
 * Chain extraction takes the second-last row (n-2), filtering out bg and proto to get a sequence of colors that defines "adjacency" for filling (e.g., if a and b are neighbors in chain, the preceding color can fill gaps between regions of a and b).
 * Horizontal filling occurs in every upper row (0 to n-3): between proto walls, if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, between adjacent filled segments with colors a and b, if they are adjacent in chain, fill the proto/bg gap with the preceding color from the adjacency.
 * Sections are contiguous blocks of rows (from 0 to n-3) that contain some (but not all) proto cells; these define vertical propagation zones.
 * Vertical propagation within a section: for each column, between proto cells, if the non-bg/non-proto cells in the vertical segment have exactly one color, fill bg cells in that segment with it.
 * Inter-section filling: between consecutive sections, for gap rows, if inner rows of sections have horizontally overlapping filled regions with colors a and b that are adjacent in chain, fill the entire overlapping vertical/horizontal gap area with the preceding color—but only if regions overlap horizontally (max start <= min end +1).
 * Subtlety: get_inner picks the first non-bg/non-proto row in a section as representative for region extraction; this assumes sections have consistent inner structure but can miss if sections have varying filled rows.
 * Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the preceding color (first in the pair), and same colors return themselves; no filling if no adjacency.
 * Proto (1) acts as walls/barriers; bg is never propagated as a color.
 * Edge cases: empty segments, all-proto rows (skipped), no chain (no inter-fills), sections touching (no gap), or non-overlapping regions (no cross-fill).
 * The bottom two rows (n-2 and n-1) are typically the chain and a fixed bottom bar; they are not processed for filling.
 * Overfilling risk: horizontal fill runs before sections, so it can create filled regions used in vertical/inter steps; but vertical only within sections, not across.
 * Assumption: grids are rectangular, colors 1-9, bg dominant in empties.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def detect_bg(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int) -> int:
    n = len(grid)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    m = len(grid[0])
    count = {}
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(m):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != proto:
                count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(Detects background as most frequent non-proto in upper rows; useful for identifying fill target.)

```python
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(grid)
    if n < 2:
        return []
    m = len(grid[0])
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(Extracts the adjacency chain from row n-2, excluding bg/proto; core for determining fill colors between regions.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:

(Performs horizontal segment filling and gap filling within a row; key for initial color spread.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture: horizontal and vertical propagation work partially, but inter-section gap filling and section detection miss cases.
 * Train 1: Generated filled upper sections correctly (e.g., 1-2-5-7 blocks in rows 1-4), but failed to fill gap between sections 0-4 and 8-11 (expected 2 in cols 2-3 rows 5-7, 6 in cols 15-16 rows 5-7; generated all 8s); also overfilled row 12 with 9s in cols 8-9 (expected 8s), and misplaced 9s in row 12; bottom chain row 18 has correct sequence but no propagation upward.
 * Train 1: get_inner selected row 8 for second section, but expected fillings suggest propagation from row 9-11; horizontal_fill didn't bridge non-adjacent chain pairs (e.g., 2 and 6 not adjacent in chain [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]).
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled some bg with 1 or 2 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 4=2 but expected 8; row 4 cols 6=3 but expected 8 in a proto-heavy area); missed vertical propagation in section 4-7 (expected isolated 3,6,7 in row 4 cols 6,10,14 but generated 8s); sections misdetected, leading to no gap fill between upper and lower blocks.
 * Train 2: Chain likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] from row 11, but is_adjacent_preceding not applied correctly for cross-section (e.g., no fill for 3-6-7 isolation); horizontal_fill filled some segments but skipped gaps due to multi-color or non-adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated upper sections (rows 1-5 all filled similarly, but expected varied with 8s in some proto areas); missed vertical fills in lower sections (e.g., rows 13-17 expected 6 in col 11, but generated 8s; rows 17-21 expected isolated 8s but filled with 1s erroneously); inter-section gap (rows 6-7 and 12) not filled (expected 9 in row 6 col 19, 6 in rows 13-17 col 11).
 * Train 3: Larger grid (27 cols) exposed section detection bug—find_sections skipped some partial-proto rows (e.g., row 20 has partial but treated as full bg); vertical_propagate_within overfilled 1s into bg areas; chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] not used for gaps between multi-section blocks.
 * Overall: horizontal_fill works for single-color segments but fails gap fills if chain order wrong or segments not adjacent; vertical_propagate_within skips multi-color verticals correctly but doesn't handle section edges; inter-section logic in program() buggy—get_filled_regions uses inner row only, missing if inner has no fills yet, and overlap check (max(st1,st2) <= min(en1,en2)+1) too strict, preventing non-exact overlaps; no iteration (fills don't propagate after initial horizontal).
 * Function vertical_propagate_within is helpful but limited to sections—extend to full columns? But no, rules confine to sections.
 * Function get_filled_regions is similar to horizontal_fill logic but extracts only—useful but redundant if run after fills.
 * Function get_inner assumes first non-empty row, but if sections have bg-only inners initially, returns None and skips fills (bug in trains).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows uniform block fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4s in cols 1-5, 8s in 8-12; rows 8-13 6s/7s/4s) suggesting horizontal_fill worked for large segments, but vertical propagation seems absent or incomplete (e.g., no blending between row blocks 6-7 and 8-14, which should be sections separated by all-1 rows); inter-section gaps (rows 7,14,21) remain all 1s (proto?), but expected would fill based on chain adjacency if blocks like 4-8-9 adjacent.
 * Test output over-relies on horizontal: entire rows filled uniformly without vertical consistency (e.g., row 15-20 has 9-4-5-3 blocks, but no upward propagation from chain row 27 [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] into gaps); chain includes 1s (proto?), which shouldn't be in chain—extract_chain filters them, but output suggests misdetection (bg=1? but 1 is proto, detect_bg skips proto so bg likely another).
 * Test output misses subtle overlaps: e.g., if sections at rows 0-6 (4/8/9) and 8-13 (6/7/4), gap row 7 should fill where 4 and 6 adjacent in chain (preceding color), but remains 1s; similarly, lower sections not bridged (e.g., 9 and 4 in rows 15-20 and 22-26 should fill row 21 if adjacent).
 * Bg detection likely wrong—upper rows have 1s (proto) and some colors, but if 1 dominates non-proto count? No, detect_bg counts non-proto, so bg= some color like 1? Wait, proto=1 skipped, so bg= most common other (but output fills with colors, not bg); output has 1s as walls but fills bg-spots with colors correctly in blocks, but no gap fills, suggesting inter-section logic broken for large grids (29 cols).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for intra-section fills but ignores chain-based bridging, leaving gaps unfilled—does not match expected full completion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where regions of colored cells (numbers 2-9) are partially filled, separated by prototype walls (1's) and background (typically 8's or similar empty spaces), and the goal is to propagate and fill the background spaces with appropriate colors based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a specific row (often the second-to-last row, excluding backgrounds and prototypes). The filling follows horizontal and vertical propagation within sections bounded by prototypes, and bridging gaps between sections using chain-based color matching, ultimately producing a completed grid that matches expected patterns without overfilling or misapplying colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototypes (proto=1) act as walls or dividers that bound sections; they should not be overwritten, and filling stops at them.
 * Background (bg, often 8) is the empty space to fill; detection of bg is crucial and should be the most common non-proto color in early rows (code uses rows 0 to n-3).
 * The chain is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, which serves as a reference for "adjacent preceding" color rules—e.g., if two colors A and B are adjacent in the chain (in either order), a fill color C can bridge them if C precedes them adjacently in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling occurs within rows, filling bg gaps between proto walls if the segment has a single dominant color, and bridging adjacent segments if their colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Vertical propagation fills bg within column segments bounded by proto in a section, using the single color if present.
 * Sections are contiguous row groups (from 0 to n-3) that contain some but not all proto in a row; gaps between sections (rows with all bg or all proto?) are bridged vertically by finding overlapping horizontal regions in "inner" rows of adjacent sections and filling the gap rows with chain-derived colors where overlaps match.
 * Subtlety: "Inner" rows for bridging are the first non-proto/bg row in a section; if none, skip. Overlaps are horizontal position-based (max start to min end).
 * Chain adjacency check (is_adjacent_preceding) returns the preceding color if A and B are neighbors in chain, but only if they match exactly (order flexible); if A==B, return A. This is used for bridging but may fail if chain order matters directionally (unobserved).
 * Gaps between sections only fill where upper and lower regions overlap horizontally; non-overlapping areas stay bg.
 * Easy to miss: Full-row bg or proto rows (like rows n-1 and n-2 in some examples) are not processed for sections or chain if excluded; chain is strictly from row n-2 non-bg/proto cells.
 * Another subtlety: In vertical propagation, collect colors in a column segment excluding bg/proto, and fill only if exactly one unique color; multi-color segments don't fill.
 * Horizontal fill first applies to all rows 0 to n-3, then vertical within sections, then inter-section bridging—order matters to avoid overfilling.
 * Bg detection scans only early rows (0 to n-3), assuming later rows are chain/reserved; if grid has varying bg, this fails.
 * In examples, some expected fillings create vertical stacks (e.g., 2's and 6's in gaps) that span multiple rows, suggesting bridging applies to entire gap height.
 * Proto rows can be partial; sections end when a row is all proto or no proto.
 * Chain may have duplicates or orders that imply directionality (e.g., 2 before 3 allows filling with 2 between 3-regions? But code returns preceding, which may be wrong).
 * Test inputs may have different bg (e.g., 1 as bg?) or wider grids, requiring robust detection.
 * Unobserved: Some expected outputs leave certain bg unfilled if no chain match, or fill with specific colors from chain positions.

    # Fills bg vertically in columns within a section if single color in segment. Good for intra-section consistency, but doesn't handle multi-color.
    # (Full as in code.)
```

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `get_inner`: Attempts to find first non-bg/proto row in section for bridging reference, but in examples, it picks rows that lead to wrong overlaps (e.g., picks filled rows, causing no bridging).
- `get_filled_regions`: Extracts single-color segments between proto in a row, but when used for bridging, it fails to align upper/lower overlaps correctly, leading to no fills in gaps.
- Overall program structure: Applies horizontal fill to all rows first (good), vertical within sections (partial), but inter-section bridging is flawed—wrong inner row selection and overlap logic miss vertical stacks in gaps.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects bg=8 and extracts chain (e.g., in Train 1: [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5,...]), and applies some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., fills single-color segments like 7's in Train 1 row 2).
 * Horizontal fill works partially: In Train 1, it correctly fills some bg to match colors within segments (e.g., row 1 fills 1's), but overfills bridges incorrectly (e.g., fills 7's where expected has 8's in row 1 cols 11-13).
 * Vertical propagation works in simple cases but misses in complex sections: In Train 1, it fills some but leaves gaps unfilled vertically.
 * Section finding identifies partial-proto row groups correctly (e.g., Train 1 sections at rows 1-4 and 8-11), but bridging between sections fails entirely—no fills in gap rows 5-7 and 12-13, where expected has vertical 2's (cols 2-3) and 6's (cols 16-17) based on chain adjacency (e.g., 2 precedes 1? Chain links needed).
 * In Train 1 generated vs expected: Rows 1 differs (generated fills 7's in cols 11-13 and 1's in 14-17; expected has 8's in 11-13); rows 5-7 all 8's in generated but expected has 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in 16-17 across 3 rows; row 12 all 8's but expected has 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in 16-17; row 13 differs (generated has 1's/4's/2's but expected has 1's/8's). Reason unknown but likely wrong overlap detection in bridging.
 * In Train 2 generated vs expected: Minimal filling (many 8's stay); row 1 has extra 2 in col 4 (generated) vs 8 expected; rows 4-5 all 8's but expected row 4 has 3/6/7 isolated; no bridging fills vertical gaps (e.g., expected row 4 has scattered colors, but generated leaves empty). Chain [2,3,4,6,5,7,9] not used for bridging.
 * In Train 3 generated vs expected: Fills some horizontals (e.g., row 1 3's and 2's match), but verticals overfill (e.g., rows 4-5 duplicate row 1 fills incorrectly); sections found but bridging misses (rows 6 empty, expected has 9 in col 19; rows 12-16 all 8's but expected has 6's in col 11 across 5 rows); rows 17-22 have partial 1's but expected has 8's in many places and 9/7 isolated. Overpropagation in vertical func likely.
 * extract_chain is essential and correct for adjacency rules.
 * horizontal_fill is partially helpful but bridges too aggressively without checking chain direction.
 * vertical_propagate_within is useful but skips multi-color segments correctly—issue is in section bounds.
 * find_sections works but excludes gap rows properly.
 * is_adjacent_preceding may be broken: Returns preceding (left) in chain, but expected bridges might need the common predecessor or something else (unknown why gaps like 2's in Train 1).
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are incorrect for bridging: Wrong row selection (e.g., picks bottom of section) and overlap calc misses vertical extension to full gap height.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of sections and chain but fails bridging logic, leading to empty gaps where expected has stacked colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massively with 1's (likely misdetected as bg or proto), creating solid rows of 1's (e.g., row 0 all 1's, row 26 all 1's) where expected likely has structured regions and bg preserved in non-fill areas.
 * It applies some block fills (e.g., 4's in rows 1-6 cols 1-5, 9's in rows 1-6 cols 20-24, 6's in rows 8-14 cols 1-5), which may match intra-section propagation, but chain-based bridging seems absent (e.g., row 14 has 4's but no connection to upper/lower; rows 15-16 have mixed but overfilled with 1's in non-region spots).
 * Gaps like between rows 6-7 (all 1's/9's but mismatched) and rows 20-25 (7's but bordered by 1's) suggest failed section detection or bg=1 misfill, leaving no empty spaces and ignoring chain (unseen, but likely [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,...] from row 27).
 * This doesn't make sense as a completed puzzle—too uniform with 1's everywhere outside blocks, unlike training expecteds that preserve bg in non-connected areas and use chain for targeted fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where a partially colored canvas (with numbers 1-9 representing walls/proto=1 and colors, and 8 as background) must be completed by propagating and bridging colors horizontally and vertically, guided by a "chain" of allowed adjacent colors extracted from near the bottom row, ensuring fills respect wall boundaries and only use colors that are sequential in the chain for bridging gaps between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg=8) is the most common non-proto color in the top n-2 rows; it must be distinguished from actual colors (2-9) to avoid over-filling.
 * The chain is extracted from row n-2 (second-to-last row), including only non-bg, non-proto cells; this acts as a legend of sequential color adjacencies (e.g., if chain has ...A B..., A and B can bridge via fill with A if A precedes B).
 * Proto/walls (1) divide the grid into "sections" (consecutive rows with mixed proto and non-proto cells); vertical propagation fills bg within columns of a section only if a single non-bg/non-proto color dominates that column segment.
 * Horizontal fills occur row-by-row (for i in 0 to n-3): within a row, uniform-color segments (bounded by proto) get bg filled to match; adjacent segments bridge bg/proto gaps only if their colors are adjacent in the chain, filling with the preceding color in the pair.
 * Gaps between sections (rows between end of one section and start of next) are bridged vertically in overlapping column ranges: find uniform regions in "inner" rows of adjacent sections, check chain adjacency, and fill the gap rows' overlapping columns with the preceding color (replacing bg or proto).
 * Subtlety: Sections are only rows with some (but not all) proto cells; pure bg or pure proto rows are skipped. Inner rows for gap bridging are the first non-proto/non-bg row in a section.
 * Easy to miss: Chain adjacency is symmetric in detection but asymmetric in fill (uses preceding color); same-color regions don't need chain check. Fills shouldn't overwrite existing colors or cross proto walls. No diagonal propagation. Chain may have duplicates or gaps.
 * Across attempts: Bg detection fails if top rows have mixed colors (e.g., training 1 overfills with 8 in places expected to bridge). Vertical propagation doesn't handle multi-section overlaps correctly. Gap bridging assumes single inner row per section but may need multi-row consensus. Horizontal bridging in rows doesn't always trigger if segments aren't uniform.
 * Test input considerations: Assuming similar structure (top empty-ish, mid sections with colors/walls, bottom chain row), fills should propagate within walled blobs (e.g., uniform 4's, 9's) and bridge via chain (e.g., if chain allows 4-8 adjacency, fill between them with preceding). Proto=1 acts as borders, not fillable.

from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(Identifies wall-bounded sections for vertical propagation; helpful but buggy—excludes bottom rows and may misalign if sections touch chain row.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core bugs in propagation and bridging.
 * Training 1: Generated overfilled row 5 and 6 with 8's instead of expected 2's and 6's in columns 2-3 and 15-16; also filled row 12 with 8's in columns 8-10 where expected 9's; bottom sections like row 13 misplaced 9's to row 12. What worked: Correctly detected bg=8 and chain (implicitly [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5]); horizontal fills in rows 1-4 and 8-11 matched expected 1-blobs and inner colors. What didn't: Vertical propagation missed bridging gaps (e.g., rows 5-7 should bridge upper 1-regions to lower via chain?); gap fill between sections overwrote with 8 or skipped (e.g., rows 5-7 expected partial 2/6 from chain adjacency).
 * Training 2: Generated filled row 1 columns 4/14 with 2/5 instead of 8 (bg); row 4 all 8's but expected partial 3/6/7 in columns 6/10/14. What worked: Chain extraction likely [2,3,4,6,5,7,9]; some horizontal fills in rows 1-3/5-7 matched (e.g., 1-blobs around 2/5/7). What didn't: Bg detection may have erred (filled non-bg areas); vertical propagation in sections didn't fill row 4 gaps correctly (expected isolated colors from chain?); no bridging between upper/lower sections, leaving row 4 empty-ish.
 * Training 3: Generated duplicated row 1-5 fills into row 5 (extra 3/2 blobs); row 6 all 8's but expected empty; row 7 empty but expected 9 in col 19; rows 13-17 all 8's but expected 6 in col 11; row 18-22 partial but missed 8-fills around 1's. What worked: Section detection caught upper/mid blobs (rows 1-5/7-12/18-22); horizontal fills in row 3 matched 3/2/9. What didn't: Vertical propagation over-duplicated fills across sections; gap bridging between rows 5-7 and 12-13 failed (e.g., row 6/7/13-17 should bridge via chain [3,2,9,4,6,7] but filled wrong or skipped); chain adjacency not applied to isolated bottom colors.
 * Overall: Horizontal_fill works for intra-row uniform segments but fails bridging if segments aren't single-color or chain check misses order. Vertical_propagate_within is helpful for column fills but limited to sections (misses cross-section). Gap fill logic in program() assumes single inner row and overwrites proto incorrectly; doesn't handle non-overlapping regions. find_sections skips bottom (good, preserves chain) but may cut sections early. No extraction of "objects" (blobs) function, but get_filled_regions acts as one for rows—extend to 2D blobs? get_inner finds section reps but picks first non-empty row, which may not represent (e.g., if varying heights).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on training patterns and inferred rules; it over-propagates uniform fills (e.g., rows 1-6 all 4's in cols 1-5, rows 8-13 all 6's in cols 0-4, but likely input had partial seeds—fills should stop at walls/proto=1 and only bridge via chain, not blanket entire sections). Rows 14-15 have mixed 6/4 but row 16 jumps to 9/4/5/3 without clear vertical propagation; rows 21-25 uniform 7's suggest missed gap bridging (expected partial from chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 9-5). Bottom row 27 has isolated colors (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) matching chain pattern, but row 28 all 1's (bg?) should be empty/preserved. Differences: Too many full-block fills (e.g., 9's in rows 15-20 cols 20-24) without respecting potential wall gaps; no evident chain-based bridging (e.g., if chain is [4,8,9,7,6,4,5,3,7], why no preceding fills between 4-8 or 9-5?). Likely bg=1 here (all borders 1), but program assumed 8—mismatch causes wrong detection. Output ignores subtle section gaps (e.g., rows 6-7/13-14/20-21 all partial 1's or 9's, expected bridged colors). To fix: Adjust bg detection for 1-borders; add 2D blob extraction for better region matching; ensure gap fills only in overlapping cols with chain-preceding color.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to propagate and fill background areas (typically 8) with appropriate colors based on adjacent colored segments separated by prototype walls (1), using rules derived from a "chain" of colors extracted from a specific row, while respecting sections defined by prototype presence and ensuring consistent vertical and horizontal propagation without overwriting existing colors or prototypes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg, often 8) is detected as the most common non-prototype color in upper rows (excluding the last two rows); if no such color, default to the bottom-left value.
 * The "chain" is a sequence of non-bg, non-proto colors extracted strictly from the second-to-last row (n-2), used to determine fill colors for gaps between adjacent segments of different colors (e.g., if colors a and b are adjacent in the chain, use the preceding color in that pair to fill between a and b segments).
 * Horizontal filling occurs within each row: identify segments between proto walls (1's), fill bg gaps within uniform-color segments, and fill bg gaps between adjacent uniform segments using the chain's adjacency rule.
 * Sections are contiguous row groups (from row 0 to n-3) that contain at least one proto but not all protos in the row; vertical propagation fills bg columns within a section based on uniform colors in vertical stacks between protos.
 * Between sections, if there's a gap (all-bg rows), fill vertically by matching overlapping horizontal regions from "inner" rows of adjacent sections (first non-empty row in each) using the chain for color adjacency, but only where segments overlap horizontally.
 * Subtleties: Propagation should not cross protos or fill entire rows/columns if they lack defining segments; chain adjacency checks both directions (a-b or b-a) and returns the first color in the pair; vertical fills within sections must skip protos and only fill if a single color dominates the stack; gaps between sections require both upper and lower sections to have defined inner regions, and fills are limited to overlapping column ranges; do not fill the last two rows (they seem reserved for chain and bottom border); proto (1) acts as impenetrable walls, never to be overwritten; in examples, bg is always 8, but detection allows flexibility; sections exclude fully-proto or fully-non-proto rows; horizontal fills happen before section-based verticals; unhelpful to fill non-bg areas or ignore chain order.
 * Easy to miss: Chain is only from row n-2 and ignores bg/proto there; adjacent preceding returns the first of the pair, not necessarily the common color; vertical propagation within sections is column-wise and stops at protos; between-section fills require exact overlap in column ranges and use inner rows (first non-proto/bg row in section); if no inner row (all proto/bg), skip; in multi-row sections, inner might be the first filled row post-horizontal; examples show symmetric fillings in gaps, but only where chain justifies; test grids have 1 as proto and bg, with colors 2-9, and last two rows as chain and border.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def detect_bg(grid: List[List[int]], proto: int, n: int, m: int) -> int:
    count = {}
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(m):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != proto:
                count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1
    if not count:
        return grid[n - 1][0] if n > 0 and m > 0 else 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the dominant non-proto color in upper grid, excluding last two rows.)

```python
def extract_chain(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, bg: int, proto: int) -> List[int]:
    if n < 2:
        return []
    return [grid[n - 2][j] for j in range(m) if grid[n - 2][j] != bg and grid[n - 2][j] != proto]
```
(This extracts the key color sequence from row n-2, filtering out bg and proto, essential for adjacency-based filling.)

```python
def is_adjacent_preceding(chain: List[int], a: int, b: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if a == b:
        return a
    for ii in range(len(chain) - 1):
        if (chain[ii] == a and chain[ii + 1] == b) or (chain[ii] == b and chain[ii + 1] == a):
            return chain[ii]
    return None
```
(This checks chain for adjacent pairs and returns the preceding color, handling both orders; crucial for gap fills, and handles same-color case by returning the color.)

```python
def find_sections(grid: List[List[int]], n: int, m: int, proto: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    sections = []
    i = 0
    while i < n - 2:
        row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
        if row_has_proto and not row_all_proto:
            sec_start = i
            i += 1
            while i < n - 2:
                row_has_proto = any(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                row_all_proto = all(grid[i][j] == proto for j in range(m))
                if not (row_has_proto and not row_all_proto):
                    break
                i += 1
            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as contiguous rows with mixed proto/non-proto, excluding last two rows and fully proto/non-proto rows; useful for scoping vertical propagations.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    row = grid[i]
    walls = [-1] + [j for j in range(m) if row[j] == proto] + [m]
    comps: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    for k in range(len(walls) - 1):
        s = walls[k] + 1
        e = walls[k + 1] - 1
        if s > e:
            continue
        seg_colors = {row[j] for j in range(s, e + 1) if row[j] != proto and row[j] != bg}
        if len(seg_colors) == 1:
            c = next(iter(seg_colors))
            for j in range(s, e + 1):
                if row[j] == bg:
                    row[j] = c
            comps.append((s, e, c))
    for k in range(len(comps) - 1):
        left_s, left_e, a = comps[k]
        right_s, right_e, b = comps[k + 1]
        fill_c = is_adjacent_preceding(chain, a, b)
        if fill_c is not None:
            for j in range(left_e + 1, right_s):
                if row[j] == bg:
                    row[j] = fill_c
```
(This performs intra-row filling: uniform segment gap fills and between-segment chain-based fills; applied to all upper rows, foundational step.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    for j in range(m):
        i = sec_start
        while i <= sec_end:
            if grid[i][j] == proto:
                i += 1
                continue
            v_start = i
            colors_set = set()
            i_temp = i
            while i_temp <= sec_end and grid[i_temp][j] != proto:
                cc = grid[i_temp][j]
                if cc != bg and cc != proto:
                    colors_set.add(cc)
                i_temp += 1
            v_end = i_temp - 1
            if len(colors_set) == 1:
                c = next(iter(colors_set))
                for k in range(v_start, v_end + 1):
                    if grid[k][j] == bg:
                        grid[k][j] = c
            i = i_temp
```
(This fills vertical bg stacks within a section if dominated by one color, skipping protos; post-horizontal, good for intra-section consistency.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program applies horizontal fills correctly in many local segments but fails on vertical propagations between sections, leaving gap rows all bg where expected has patterned fills (e.g., in Train 1, rows 5-7 should have 2's in cols 2-3 and 6's in cols 15-16, but generated all 8's; similarly, row 12 has 9's in cols 8-9 and 2's in cols 15-16 expected, but generated all 8's except some misplaced).
 * In Train 1, upper sections (rows 1-4) filled horizontally well (e.g., 7's in cols 11-13, 1's around), but between-section gap (rows 5-7) unfilled; lower sections partially filled but missed between row 8-11 and 13-16 gap (row 12 unfilled); chain seems extracted correctly but not used for vertical gaps.
 * Train 2 generated has incorrect horizontal fills, e.g., row 1 has 2 in col 4 where expected 8 (bg), and row 4 has 3 in col 6 where expected all bg except sections; vertical in row 4-5 gap unfilled (expected 3,6,7 isolated but program filled wrongly); sections misidentified, leading to overfills like 2,3,5,7 propagating incorrectly; chain adjacency not triggering vertical between sections.
 * Train 3 generated fills upper section (rows 1-5) with some extras like 3's propagating where expected 8's (e.g., row 1-2 cols 6-8 should be 8's, but filled 3's); middle section (rows 8-11) similar overfill with 4's; lower section (rows 17-21) unfilled vertically where expected 8's in some but program left bg; between-section gaps like rows 6-7 and 12-16 mostly unfilled (expected some 6's in cols 11 and 9 in row 6); row 3 has 3's and 2's correct but 9 in col 19 filled early.
 * Function `get_inner` is helpful but buggy: it returns the first non-proto/bg row in section, but in generated, it skips fills if inner is None or mismatched, leading to no between-section verticals; in Train 1, inner_u for upper section is row 1 (has 1's,2's), inner_l row 8 (1's,3's), but no overlap fill happened for cols 2-3 (2's) or 15-16 (6's).
 * Function `get_filled_regions` is useful for identifying uniform segments post-horizontal, but in between-section logic, it only fills if exact overlap and chain match, but generated misses non-overlapping or partial overlaps (e.g., Train 1 row 12 cols 8-9 for 9's from upper 9's? but chain issue).
 * The main program applies horizontal_fill to all rows <n-2 correctly, but vertical_propagate_within only within sections (good), but between-sections loop fails to trigger fills, possibly due to no overlap detection or chain not finding preceding (e.g., in Train 1, 2 and 6 may not be adjacent in chain [from row 18: 2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5? wait, row 18 has 2 8 3 8 9 8 4 8 2 8 6 8 7 8 5 8 8 8 8, so chain [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5], yes 2-6 adjacent via 2-6? no direct, but 4-2 then 2-6? wait, checks pairs, so 2-6 is direct pair, preceding 2).
 * Unhelpful: No function for full vertical chain propagation across gaps; current between-section only does horizontal overlap-based, but examples need full-column patterned fills matching upper/lower patterns via chain; `detect_bg` works (8), but if grid has varying bg, it might fail.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output performs horizontal fills correctly within sections (e.g., rows 1-5 fill 4's in cols 1-5, 8's in 8-12, 9's in 20-24; rows 8-12 fill 6's cols 1-5, 7's 8-12, 4's 20-24; rows 15-19 fill 9's 1-5, 4's 8-12, 5's 14-18, 3's 20-24), and some vertical within sections (e.g., uniform across multi-rows), but leaves between-section gaps all 1's (bg here is 1?) unfilled—e.g., rows 6-7 and 13-14 all 1's, but expected likely has patterned fills like vertical extensions of 4-8-9 or 6-7-4 using chain from row 26 [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7,... filtered non-1], such as filling row 6-7 with 8's where upper 8's overlap lower? but no, gaps should propagate via chain adjacencies (e.g., 4 adjacent to 6? chain has 4-7,7-6 no; but 9-4 in lower to upper).
 * It does not look correct because gaps (rows 6-7 between upper 4/8/9 section and middle 6/7/4; rows 13-14 between middle and lower 9/4/5/3; row 20? wait 20 is section start, but row 25? wait grid has 28 rows?) are unfilled, similar to training failures—expected should have vertical fills in gaps matching adjacent section colors via chain (e.g., row 6 cols 8-12 might fill 7? if 8-7 adjacent in chain, but chain has 8? row 26 has 4 1 8 1 9 etc., chain [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7], so 8-9 pair preceding 8; 4-7 pair 4, etc.), and bottom section rows 21-25 fill 7's cols 20-24 correctly but gaps above unfilled; also, bg is 1 here (all borders 1), proto 1? wait no, proto=1 but bg also 1? detection may fail since upper counts 1 as proto, but if 1 is both, max non-1 is say 4, but generated treats 1 as bg, filling over it wrongly? wait, in generated, it fills sections but leaves 1's in gaps, suggesting bg=1 detected wrong or proto=1 skips properly, but no vertical gap fills.
 * Test output misses between-section vertical propagations entirely, like trainings, and may have bg detection issue (upper rows have many 1's as proto/border, but colors like 4 appear, so bg should be absent or default, but generated fills as if 1 is bg); also, row 0 and 27 all 1's correct (borders), row 26 chain untouched, but no gap patterns (e.g., row 6 should perhaps have 8's in cols 8-12 if propagating from upper 8 to lower 7 via chain 8-9-4-7 no direct, but logic needs adjustment for non-direct? no, only adjacent pairs).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where numbers represent colors or barriers: 1 acts as walls/barriers (proto), 8 is typically background (bg), other numbers (2-9) are specific colors to propagate and fill into bg areas. The goal is to fill bg cells with appropriate colors based on connected uniform regions, vertical/horizontal propagation within wall-bounded sections, and gap-filling between sections using adjacency rules derived from a "chain" (likely a key sequence) extracted from near the bottom of the grid, ensuring shapes and separations match implied puzzle logic like nonograms or region-filling with constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into segments/regions both horizontally (within rows) and vertically (across rows); sections are defined as consecutive rows that contain some 1's but are not entirely 1's, and propagation must respect these boundaries without crossing full-1 rows or unrelated areas.
 * Background (bg, usually 8) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in upper rows; it must be filled only where a uniform color can be inferred from adjacent non-bg/non-proto cells, but never overwrite existing colors or 1's.
 * The "chain" is extracted from the second-to-last row, capturing non-bg/non-proto cells as a sequence of colors (e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in train1); this acts as an adjacency key—fills between regions use a color from the chain only if two adjacent regions' colors (a and b) appear next to each other in the chain, preferring the "preceding" one in the pair.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, segments between 1's (or edges) should be filled with a single color if all non-bg/non-proto cells in that segment share one color; bg cells in the segment get that color, but gaps between filled segments (still bg) get filled via chain if the bounding segments' colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a detected section (consecutive partial-1 rows), fill vertically column-by-column: if a vertical segment between 1's has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, propagate that color to all bg cells in that vertical run; do not cross 1's or section boundaries.
 * Gap filling between sections: For gaps (all-8 or partial rows) between two sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section), get their horizontal filled regions, and for overlapping column ranges between upper/lower regions with colors a/b, if a and b are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rectangle (overlapping columns, all gap rows) with the preceding color from the chain pair; only fill bg or 1's in those positions (but 1's might be subtle—avoid overwriting true walls?).
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency is bidirectional but returns the "preceding" color in the pair (e.g., if chain has ...a,b..., fill with a; if ...b,a..., fill with b); sections must exclude the last two rows (header/footer?); inner row selection picks the first row in a section with any non-1/bg, but if none, skip; do not fill if segment colors aren't uniform (len(seg_colors)==1); gaps only if gap_start <= gap_end; vertical propagation skips 1's but fills around them if uniform; chain extraction ignores bg and 1's but preserves order; in multi-row uniform blocks, ensure consistency across rows; bottom row (and possibly second-bottom) is the key and should remain unchanged; full-8 rows separate sections but aren't sections themselves; overlapping regions in gap-fill use max/min columns for projection.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal fill must happen before vertical/section detection (as in code), but gap-fill after; chain might have duplicates (e.g., two 2's in train1), so adjacency checks all pairs; if no uniform color, leave as bg; vertical fill only within section bounds, not across gaps; in train3, large sections need multi-row consistency; test grid has wider layout with more colors (3-9), so chain likely longer; do not fill the very top/bottom rows unless they fit section rules; bg detection scans only upper rows (n-2) to avoid key contamination.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding but incomplete implementation of propagation and gap-filling rules.
 * Horizontal filling worked partially: In train1, upper sections (rows 1-4) correctly filled uniform 1/2/5/7 segments between 1's, but failed to fill intra-row gaps between segments (e.g., row1 generated 1's but left 7/8 areas as 8's instead of using chain); similar in train2 (filled some 1/2/3/5/7 but left row1's 2-block incomplete) and train3 (filled multi-row 1/3/2/9 blocks but missed vertical consistency in lower sections).
 * Vertical propagation worked somewhat: In train1, it extended colors within sections (e.g., 2's and 5's in rows 2-3), but skipped or failed in wider blocks; in train2, filled rows5-7 correctly for 1/4/6/9 but not row4 gaps; in train3, extended upper 1/3/2 blocks across rows1-5 but left lower sections (rows8-11) with incomplete 4/6 fills (e.g., row9 has 6 but not propagated fully).
 * Section detection worked basically: Correctly identified partial-1 row groups (e.g., train1 sections at rows0-4 and 8-11; train2 at 0-2 and 5-7; train3 at 0-5 and 8-11 and 17-21), excluding full-8 and last two rows, but <n-2 limit missed some lower sections in train3 (e.g., rows17-21 detected but propagation incomplete).
 * Gap filling failed entirely: No fills in inter-section gaps; e.g., train1 generated all-8 rows5-7 where expected has 2/6 blocks (projected from upper/lower), and row12 all-8 vs expected 9/2; train2 row4 all-8 vs expected 3/6/7 blocks; train3 row6-7 and row12-16 all-8 vs expected 9/6 blocks—likely because get_inner returned valid rows but overlap checks (o_l > o_r) or chain adjacency failed (e.g., wrong preceding color or no match); also, perform_gap_fills skipped if no inner or gap too small.
 * Chain extraction worked: For train1, likely [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] matching bottom; used in horizontal but not effectively in gaps (e.g., 2 and 6 should fill with preceding if adjacent in chain, but didn't).
 * Bg detection worked: 8 correctly identified in all.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: perform_gap_fills is broken (no fills occur, possibly due to strict overlap or fill_c None; overwrites proto=1 in gaps? but shouldn't); get_filled_regions misses non-uniform post-fill; vertical_propagate_within skips too aggressively (leaves bg in multi-color verticals, but examples need uniform check); overall program modifies grid_out in-place but doesn't handle multi-section gaps or chain duplicates well; no function for full-grid uniformity check post-fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete propagation and missing gap fills similar to training failures; e.g., rows1-6 have 4's and 8's filled horizontally but no vertical extension to row6's partial 9's, and row7-8 all 1's (possibly misbg?) where gaps should project colors like 9's from above; rows8-12 fill 6/7/4 but row13 cuts 4's short (ends with 1's instead of full block), suggesting horizontal_fill failed end-segment; row15 has 9/5/3 blocks but row16 all 1's (gap unfilled, should project from row15 to row20's 3/7?); rows21-25 fill 3 then 7's but inconsistently (row21 3's full, rows22-26 7's but row26 all 1's?); bottom key row27 has 4/8/9/etc. unchanged (good), but overall lacks vertical consistency in lower half (e.g., 5/3/7 blocks not propagated up from key projections) and gap rectangles (e.g., between row12 and row14, no 4/5/3 fills); compared to training patterns, it over-relies on horizontal (matches upper 4/8/9 shapes) but misses chain-based gap/vertical for lower (e.g., expected likely has 7's extending up from row22 into row16 gap, using chain adjacencies like 3-7 or 5-7); without expected, it differs by leaving too many 1's/bg in gaps/verticals, making shapes incomplete (e.g., 4-block in row13-14 not uniform height).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where a 2D grid represents a visual scene with background cells (typically 8), wall/prototype cells (1), and partial colored regions (numbers 2-9). The goal is to propagate and fill background cells with colors based on uniformity in rows/columns, adjacency rules from a "chain" extracted from near the bottom row, and rules for filling gaps between vertically separated "sections" of the grid defined by partial wall rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg, usually 8) cells must only be filled if they can be unambiguously propagated from adjacent uniform colored segments; never overwrite existing colors, walls (proto=1), or other non-bg cells.
 * The "chain" is a sequence of colors from the second-to-last row (n-2), excluding bg and proto, used to determine if two colors are "adjacent" (i.e., appear next to each other in the chain, in either order) for gap-filling; if so, the preceding color in the chain can fill gaps between matching segments.
 * Sections are contiguous groups of rows (up to n-2) that contain at least one proto=1 but are not entirely proto=1; these define bounded areas for vertical propagation.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, identify segments between proto walls; if a segment has exactly one non-bg/non-proto color, fill all bg in that segment with it; then, for adjacent segments, if their colors are adjacent in the chain, fill bg gaps between them with the preceding color from the chain pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section and per column, fill bg cells in stretches between proto walls using the single uniform color in that stretch if present.
 * Inter-section filling: Between consecutive sections, identify "inner" rows (first non-proto/bg row in each section), extract uniform colored regions from those rows, find overlapping column ranges between upper and lower regions, and if the colors are adjacent in the chain, fill the entire gap rows (between sections) in those columns with the preceding chain color—but only if both sections have valid inner rows.
 * Subtleties: Chain adjacency checks must consider order (preceding color matters, not just presence); sections exclude the last two rows (n-1 and n-2 are reserved for chain/bottom); bg detection counts non-proto in upper rows (0 to n-3) to find the most common non-proto as bg; do not fill if segments have multiple colors; gap filling between sections only applies to bg cells and only in overlapping columns; empty sections or no inner row skips filling; chain may have duplicates or gaps, but adjacency is pairwise consecutive only.
 * Edge cases: All-proto rows end sections; no sections means no vertical/inter-section filling; chain may be empty (no gap filling); varying grid widths (m) and heights (n); test inputs may have larger/more complex sections; bottom two rows (including chain row) are never modified; proto=1 is fixed and blocks propagation.
 * Considerations across attempts: Horizontal filling often works for intra-row uniformity but fails on chain-based gap filling if is_adjacent_preceding returns wrong preceding color; vertical propagation misses if sections are misidentified (e.g., including all-proto rows); inter-section filling fails if inner rows are not correctly selected (e.g., picking a row with no non-bg cells) or if overlap detection ignores partial overlaps; bg detection assumes upper rows, but if grid is small (n<3), chain/extractions return empty; no handling for multiple chains or non-standard proto/bg; fillings can cascade (horizontal then vertical then inter-section), so order matters.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it implements a full pipeline (bg detection, chain extraction, horizontal/vertical filling, section-based inter-filling) showing partial understanding of propagation rules.
 * Horizontal filling works correctly for uniform segments in rows (e.g., fills 1-regions around 2/5/7 in ex1 rows 2-3) but fails chain-based gaps (e.g., doesn't fill between 7 and 1 in ex1 row1 correctly, leaving extra 1's unfilled? Wait, actually overfills some 7's into bg areas).
 * Vertical propagation succeeds in sections for uniform columns (e.g., fills 5's vertically in ex1) but misses if sections are wrong (e.g., in ex3, doesn't fill lower vertical stacks like 6's in rows 13-17).
 * Section finding is mostly correct (identifies partial-wall groups) but excludes last two rows properly; however, inter-section gap filling fails entirely—e.g., in ex1, gaps between sections (rows 5-7) remain all bg instead of filling 2's and 6's based on chain adjacency from upper/lower inners; similarly, row12 gap unfilled for 9's/2's.
 * In ex2, horizontal fills some (e.g., 2/5/7 in row2) but misses vertical in sections and all inter-section (row4 remains bg, expected 3/6/7); chain extraction works but not applied between sections.
 * In ex3, fills upper sections horizontally/vertically (e.g., 3/2 in rows1-4) but misses many lower fillings (e.g., rows7-12 partial, rows13-17 all bg instead of 6's, rows18-22 unfilled 1-regions); inter-section skips due to no inner or overlap issues.
 * Bg detection works (identifies 8 correctly); chain extraction is accurate but underused (adjacency only for horizontal, not fully for vertical/gaps).
 * Overall, intra-section filling (horizontal/vertical) partially succeeds (~50% in ex1/3), but inter-section logic broken (no gap fills observed); no overfilling of proto or bottom rows, but underfilling dominates.
 * Function `get_inner` is helpful but fragile (returns first non-proto/bg row, but if none, skips—happens in ex1 row12?); `get_filled_regions` good for extracting uniform segments but only used post-horizontal, so misses if horizontal incomplete.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `horizontal_fill` has redundant comps building (could fill in one pass); entire inter-section loop assumes consecutive sections only and max/min overlap, but doesn't handle non-overlapping or multi-region overlaps well (e.g., ex3 complex widths).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows large uniform blocks filled (e.g., rows1-5 all 4's in cols1-5, 8's in cols8-12, 9's in cols20-24; rows8-12 6's/7's/4's; rows15-19 9's/4's/5's/3's; rows21-25 7's), with horizontal propagation seeming applied but vertical/inter-section incomplete (e.g., rows6-7 and13-14 all 1's suggest no gap filling between sections; bottom row28 has scattered colors but row27 all 1's unfilled).
 * It matches a pattern of filling wide uniform regions but leaves potential section gaps as 1's (which may be proto, but expected likely fills bg=1? Wait, test uses 1 as bg/proto? Confusion: test grid has 1 as bg/proto, differing from training's 8/1—program hardcodes proto=1, detects bg=1? But output fills over 1's incorrectly, e.g., row1 all 1's unfilled but should propagate if sections present.
 * Differences: Overfills entire blocks without wall respect (e.g., rows1-5 ignore potential proto in input); misses vertical uniformity (e.g., col1 all 1's/4's/6's/9's but not propagated down sections); chain-based gaps not filled (e.g., between row5-6 and row12-13, remains 1's); bottom row28 has 4/8/9/... but no propagation to row27; overall, looks like horizontal-only filling on assumed input sections, ignoring inter-section rules—does not match expected full propagation seen in training diffs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where a background color (e.g., 8 or 1) represents empty space to be filled with colored regions (numbers 2-9), guided by walls (prototype value, often 1), a chain of colors extracted from a specific row (second-to-last), and rules for propagating fills horizontally within rows, vertically within sections bounded by walls, and across gaps between sections based on adjacency in the chain. The goal is to extend uniform color regions into adjacent background spaces while respecting wall boundaries and chain-based connections for bridging sections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection: The background is the most common non-prototype color in the top n-2 rows; if none, fall back to the last row's first cell. This works for uniform backgrounds like 8 or 1 but may fail if backgrounds vary or if prototypes dominate early rows.
 * Chain extraction: Colors are pulled exclusively from the second-to-last row (index n-2), excluding background and prototype; this acts as a "key" sequence for adjacency checks but ignores the actual last row (which seems to be a fixed chain of single colors separated by background in examples, e.g., [2,3,9,4,2,6,7,5] in ex1).
 * Sections: Defined as contiguous row ranges (from 0 to n-3) where rows contain some but not all prototypes (1s as walls); pure prototype or pure non-prototype rows end sections. This identifies "puzzle areas" but misses sections that span full prototype rows or have no prototypes.
 * Horizontal filling: Within a row, identify segments between prototype walls, fill background in uniform-color segments with that color, then bridge gaps between adjacent uniform segments if their colors are adjacent in the chain (using is_adjacent_preceding, which checks for direct neighbors in chain and returns the preceding color). Subtlety: Only fills background, not overwriting existing colors; adjacency is symmetric but returns the first in pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section and per column, fill background in vertical runs bounded by prototypes if the run has exactly one non-background/non-prototype color. This extends colors downward/upward but only within section bounds and doesn't handle multi-color runs or propagation across sections.
 * Gap filling between sections: For consecutive sections, identify an "inner" row (first non-empty non-proto/bg row in section), get uniform horizontal regions there, then for overlapping column ranges of regions with colors adjacent in chain, fill background in the row gap with the preceding chain color. Subtleties: Only if both sections have valid inners; overlaps must align column-wise; doesn't propagate vertically in gaps or handle non-overlapping regions; assumes sections are vertically stacked without horizontal offsets.
 * Overall: Fills are done in phases (all horizontal first, then vertical per section, then gaps); output is a copy of input with only background replaced. Easy to miss: Chain is unordered for adjacency (just checks pairs, not sequence position); no diagonal or multi-step propagation; last row is ignored for filling/extraction; prototypes (1) are never filled/overwritten; in test cases, background is 1 and prototypes may be absent or different.
 * Across attempts: Programs assume fixed proto=1 and chain from n-2; miss full last-row integration (e.g., expected uses last row for gap colors like 2/6 in ex1 rows 5-7); overfill or underfill horizontals if segments aren't uniform; verticals don't cross section gaps; gaps only fill if exact column overlap and chain adjacency.

The following functions are broken or not helpful: get_inner (picks arbitrary first non-empty row in section, but ignores if all bg/proto—leads to skipped gaps); get_filled_regions (recomputes uniform segments post-fill, but redundant with horizontal_fill and misses non-uniform); overall program (phasing is good but gap logic too rigid, e.g., requires exact overlap and doesn't use last row chain).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, with partial horizontal/vertical fills but missing gap bridges and section extensions using the last row chain.
 * Train 1: Generated filled horizontals in puzzle rows (e.g., row1: 1s expanded, row2: 2s/5s/7s correct) and some verticals (e.g., 7s in row3-4 col11-13), but failed to fill gaps between sections—e.g., rows5-7 all bg except edges, but expected 2s in col2-3 and 6s in col15-16 from last-row chain adjacency (2 follows 1? unknown why missed); row12 has 9s but expected 9s col8-9 and 2s col15-16; also overfilled row1 col11-14 with 7s where expected bg/8s. Sections likely misidentified, skipping gap fill.
 * Train 2: Generated some horizontals (e.g., row1: 1s and 2s partial) but underfilled verticals/gaps—e.g., row4 all bg, but expected 3/6/7 singles in cols6/10/14 from last row; row5-7 partial 1s/4s/6s/9s but missed extensions into bg; vertical prop didn't trigger due to multi-color or section bounds. Chain adjacency not applied across the empty section (rows4).
 * Train 3: Generated horizontals in upper sections (e.g., rows1-5: 3s/2s/9s expanded) and lower (rows8-12: 4s partial), but missed vertical extensions in lower sections (e.g., rows13-17 all bg, expected 6s in col11 across rows13-17 from chain?); rows18-22 partial 1s but no fills into bg for 8s; huge gap (rows6-7 and 13-17) unfilled, expected 9 in row6 col19 and 6s in rows13-17 col11. Section finding skipped pure bg rows, blocking propagation.
 * extract_chain useful but incomplete—uses n-2 row, but examples suggest last row ([2,3,4,6,5,7,9,...]) is the true chain for adjacency/gap colors (e.g., ex1 fills 2/6 from positions near 1s).
 * horizontal_fill works for intra-row but not applied post-vertical, missing iterative fills.
 * vertical_propagate_within good for within-section but doesn't handle inter-section or use chain for vertical gaps.
 * Gap logic in program fails due to get_inner picking wrong rows or no overlap (e.g., ex1 sections at 0-4 and 8-11, gap rows5-7 unfilled as inners don't align for 2/6 from chain).
 * find_sections misses pure non-proto sections (e.g., ex2 row4 bg, treated as gap not section).
 * Overall: Understanding of phases/adjacency is there, but last-row chain integration missing; no iteration for propagating fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It performs horizontal fills well (e.g., rows1-5: 4s expanded left, 8s middle, 9s right; rows8-12: 6s/7s/4s; rows15-19: 9s/4s/5s/3s; rows22-26: 7s), and some vertical consistency (e.g., 4s stack in rows1-5 cols1-5). However, it does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagation across apparent section gaps (e.g., rows6-7 and 13-14 all 1s/bg, unfilled, but if sections are rows0-5/7-12/14-19/21-26, gaps should bridge using chain adjacency, e.g., potentially filling 8/7/4 transitions with preceding colors like 9 or 5? unknown exact chain from last-but-one row); row27 has singles (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) like last row in trains, suggesting it's the chain source, but output doesn't use it to fill upward gaps (e.g., row21 all 1s unfilled). Also, edges are 1s (bg?), but no fills into surrounding 1s where colors touch chain positions. Differs from expected logic in trains by over-relying on horizontals without gap/vertical bridges, leaving empty sections (e.g., rows6-7/13-14/20-21 all 1s, should likely propagate from adjacent blocks like 4-to-6 or 7-to-4 via chain).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling of background areas (likely 8 in training examples, 1 in test) using rules based on "prototype" walls (fixed as 1), sections of rows with partial walls, and a "chain" of colors extracted from near the bottom row to determine valid adjacencies for filling gaps horizontally, vertically within sections, and between sections. The goal is to fill unknown/background cells with colors that maintain connectivity and adjacency rules derived from the chain, without overfilling or violating section boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (proto=1) acts as walls that divide rows into segments; sections are groups of consecutive rows (excluding top 2 and bottom 2?) that contain some but not all 1's, used for vertical propagation.
 * Background (bg) is auto-detected as the most common non-proto color in the top rows (excluding last 2); in training it's 8, but test uses 1 as apparent bg/walls interchangeably, suggesting code's fixed proto=1 may not generalize if inputs vary.
 * Chain is extracted from the second-to-last row, keeping only non-bg non-proto cells; used to check "adjacent preceding" pairs (if a and b are neighbors in chain or swapped, return the first/preceding one as fill color).
 * Horizontal filling: Within rows, fill bg gaps between walls if the segment has exactly one color; then bridge gaps between filled segments using chain adjacency if colors match a valid pair.
 * Vertical propagation: Within a section, for each column, fill bg in vertical runs bounded by walls if the run has exactly one non-bg color, but skip edges if at section boundaries.
 * Between sections: Identify "inner" rows (first non-proto non-bg row in section), get horizontal filled regions, find overlapping column ranges between upper/lower sections' regions, and fill bg in the gap rows between sections using chain adjacency of the region colors.
 * Subtlety: Chain adjacency is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color (first in pair); if a==b, return a directly.
 * Easy to miss: Sections exclude rows that are all-proto or no-proto; filling only happens if exactly one color in segment (avoids mixing); vertical fill skips boundary rows in sections to avoid over-propagation; between-sections fill only in overlapping columns and only if adjacency exists.
 * Chain may have duplicates or order matters for "preceding"; no filling if no valid adjacency or no overlap.
 * Gaps between sections only filled if inner rows exist and regions align; entire grid copy to avoid mutating input.
 * Potential issue: Code assumes n>=3, fixed proto=1; may fail if bg==1 or variable protos; doesn't handle empty sections or single-row sections well.
 * All training examples have a bottom chain row (row 25) with isolated colors separated by bg, likely the key for adjacencies (e.g., 3,2,9,4,6,7).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the last (and only shown) submission; training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating core horizontal filling, chain extraction, and basic vertical propagation work for simple cases without between-section gaps or complex overlaps.
 * Training example 3 failed: Generated incorrectly filled row 2 with 3's in columns 6-8 (where expected has 8's/bg) and 2's in 14-16 (expected 8's); row 6 lacks the isolated 9 in column 19 (expected has it, generated has 1? but shown as 1's); rows 12-16 have all 8's in column 11 where expected has 6's (failed vertical propagation or section detection); row 7 has no 9, and lower sections missed 6's entirely—likely due to flawed between-sections filling or inner row selection not capturing isolated colors.
 * Horizontal_fill worked partially (filled 1's correctly in many places) but overfilled bridges using chain (e.g., 1-3 adjacency assumed but not valid, or chain order wrong).
 * Vertical_propagate_within seems broken for training 3: Didn't propagate 6's downward in column 11 across rows 12-16, possibly because sections weren't detected correctly or fill_start/end skipped too much.
 * Between-sections logic in main program failed: For gap around row 6-7, didn't place the 9; for lower gaps, missed propagating 6's—likely inner_u/inner_l selection wrong (get_inner returns first non-empty row, but may need all or different), or overlap detection (o_s/o_e) too strict, or no adjacency in chain for relevant pairs.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are helpful but subtle: get_inner picks first valid row, which may miss if sections have varying inner rows; get_filled_regions identifies uniform segments correctly but only if already horizontally filled.
 * find_sections likely missed sections in training 3 (e.g., rows with isolated protos not grouped), leading to no vertical fill for 6's.
 * Overall, code handles single-section or no-gap cases (training 1/2) but breaks on multi-section with isolated colors and gaps (training 3); chain adjacency may not handle non-consecutive pairs or duplicates well.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all shown are relevant, but vertical_propagate_within and between-sections loop need debugging for edge cases like single-cell regions or boundary skips.

**Test output:**
 * The test generated output appears mostly correct at a glance but has potential issues: It propagates colors like 2,4,8,9 horizontally/vertically within apparent sections (e.g., rows 1-5 have consistent blocks of 4's and 8's/9's), and bridges some using likely chain (e.g., row 15 has 2's extended to columns 14-18 and 20-24, suggesting adjacency fill); lower sections (rows 16-20) fill 9/4/5/3 blocks vertically across 3 rows, which matches vertical propagation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Row 8 is all 1's (bg?), but if it's a separator, expected might have partial fills; row 21 has 2's in 20-24 but input/generated shows consistent filling—unknown if overfills (e.g., row 15's middle 2's in 14-18/20-24 may bridge incorrectly if chain doesn't allow 2-2 self-adjacency across gap). Rows 22-25 have 7's propagated vertically but only in 20-24, and row 26 all 1's—seems correct, but row 27 (chain?) has isolated colors without filling around them, which matches rules (no fill in chain row).
 * Bottom row 28 all 1's expected; the isolated colors in row 27 (4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7) likely form the chain, and output didn't alter them, which is good—but upper fills (e.g., 6's in rows 9-12 columns 1-5) propagated down correctly, but row 15's 2's extension to column 14-18/20-24 might be wrong if no direct chain adjacency (unknown without input chain order).
 * Key difference: Test input (inferred from output patterns) has wider grid (29 cols?) with more sections; code filled most but possibly missed between-section gaps (e.g., rows 6-7/13-14 all 1's, no cross-fills shown); looks 80% correct but subtle overfills in row 15 suggest chain adjacency misapplied (e.g., self-adjacency for 2's allowed but maybe only for distinct pairs).
 * To handle test: Need to verify chain order matches bottom isolated (e.g., if chain is 4-8-9-... , then 2-4 adjacency might fill, but 2 self-bridge in gaps may be invalid); output makes sense overall but not perfect—account for larger m and more sections.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where background areas (bg) are filled with colors based on propagation rules within and between sections delimited by prototype walls (value 1), using horizontal filling of uniform segments, vertical propagation inside sections, and inter-section filling guided by overlapping colored regions and an adjacency chain extracted from near the bottom of the grid. The chain represents a sequence of colors that determines allowable fills between adjacent but separated colors (a and b can be bridged by a preceding color in the chain if they appear adjacent in it).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prototype (1) acts as walls/barriers that segment the grid into sections; sections are identified by consecutive rows that contain some but not all 1s (mixed proto and non-proto).
 * Background (bg, often 0 or unfilled) is filled only if a segment/region has exactly one non-bg, non-proto color; multi-color segments are not filled.
 * Horizontal filling occurs first across all non-bottom rows, unifying bg in uniform-color gaps between 1s and bridging gaps between adjacent uniform segments if their colors are "adjacent" in the chain (i.e., appear next to each other in chain, filling with the preceding one).
 * Vertical propagation happens only within each section (between section start/end), filling bg in columns if the vertical segment in that column has exactly one color; it expands to cover the min-max range of that color's positions but skips over 1s.
 * Inter-section filling targets gaps between consecutive sections (rows from upper section end+1 to lower start-1), but only in columns where upper and lower "inner" rows (first non-1/bg row in each section) have overlapping uniform colored regions; fill uses chain adjacency, and only bg is overwritten.
 * Chain extraction is from the second-to-last row (n-2), collecting non-bg, non-proto values in order, skipping 1s— this row often contains the "key" sequence of isolated colors separated by 1s.
 * Adjacency check in chain is symmetric (a then b or b then a) but returns the preceding color for filling; if a==b, use a directly.
 * Bottom two rows (n-1 and possibly n-2) are treated specially: n-1 is all 1s or bg, n-2 provides chain; no filling applied to bottom rows.
 * Subtle: "Inner" row for a section is the first row within it that has any non-1, non-bg; if none, skip inter-fill for that section pair.
 * Subtle: Overlap for inter-fill is strict (max start to min end of regions); no fill if no overlap or no chain link.
 * Edge cases: Empty sections, single-row sections, full-proto rows (not sections), grids with n<2 (return as-is), or chain with duplicates/self-adjacencies.
 * No overwriting of existing non-bg colors; only bg is filled. Sections must have mixed rows (some 1s but not all) to qualify—pure non-proto rows aren't sections for vertical prop.
 * Propagation doesn't cross sections vertically or use chain for intra-section fills; chain is only for horizontal bridges and inter-section gaps.

            sections.append((sec_start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```
(This identifies sections as consecutive rows up to n-2 with partial proto coverage—key for scoping vertical and inter-fills; excludes bottom rows.)

```python
def horizontal_fill(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int, chain: List[int]):
    # (as provided in attempt; fills uniform segments between protos with their single color, and bridges gaps between adjacent segments using chain)
```
(Helpful for initial horizontal unification across all rows.)

```python
def vertical_propagate_within(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int):
    # (as provided; fills vertical bg segments within a section/column if single color present, expanding to min-max of that color)
```
(Helpful for intra-section vertical filling, but note it skips protos and only acts on bg.)

```python
def get_inner(grid: List[List[int]], sec_start: int, sec_end: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # (as provided; finds first row in section with any non-proto non-bg for inter-section reference)
```
(Helpful for selecting representative rows for overlap in inter-fills.)

```python
def get_filled_regions(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, m: int, proto: int, bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # (as provided; extracts uniform single-color segments between protos in a row, ignoring bg)
```
(Helpful for identifying regions in inner rows for overlap checks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, indicating solid implementation of horizontal filling, section detection, vertical propagation within sections, and basic inter-section filling via chain.
 * What worked: Chain extraction accurately pulls the key sequence; horizontal_fill unifies bg in uniform gaps and bridges via chain adjacency; vertical_propagate_within properly scopes to sections and fills single-color verticals without crossing walls; section finding skips bottom rows and pure rows correctly.
 * What didn't work: In the test output, large areas are over-filled with 2 (likely from chain having many 2s or self-adjacency), but isolated higher numbers (e.g., 4,8,9 in rows 3,10,17) are preserved as "seeds" without surrounding fills, suggesting incomplete propagation around them—expected more bridging if chain allows (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 4 in chain, gaps near 4 should fill with preceding color, but appear as bg or unfilled in output? Wait, output shows 2s around them, but perhaps not vertically between sections).
 * Missed potential: Inter-section filling seems limited; in test output, the lower section (rows ~20-25) has 2s only on the right, with left all 1s, but if overlaps exist with upper sections' inner rows (which have scattered 4,8,etc.), more fills expected in gaps (rows 11-16? appear all 2s, but row 17 has mixed—perhaps sections misidentified).
 * extract_chain is essential and correct (pulls from n-2, which in test output became [1,4,1,8,...] after fills? No, chain extracted before fills, so from input's n-2).
 * horizontal_fill is helpful but may over-apply bridges if chain has long 2-2 sequences, leading to uniform 2 floods.
 * vertical_propagate_within is mostly correct but in test, columns with mixed seeds (e.g., col 3 has 4 in row3, 6 in row10, 9 in row17) aren't unified vertically across sections, which is intended (only within), but gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) remain 2-filled horizontally, potentially correct if no overlap trigger.
 * get_inner and get_filled_regions are essential for inter-fills but may fail if inner row is all bg after horizontal (test output has inner rows with seeds like row3, so okay); however, overlaps might be too narrow, missing wider fills.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, though find_sections excludes i >= n-2 strictly, which is good but subtle if input has proto in bottom.

**Test output:**
 * The test output fills most of the grid with 2s in large horizontal bands (e.g., rows 1-2,4-9,11-16,18-20,22-23,25-26), preserving isolated higher colors (4,8,9 in row3; 6,7,4 in row10; 9,4,2,5,3 in row17; 7 in row23) surrounded by 2s or 1s, which makes sense if 2 is a dominant chain color and seeds are non-propagated starts.
 * It looks partially correct: Bottom row all 1s (untouched), second-last all 1s (perhaps input was mixed, but filled to proto? No, code doesn't fill bottom), chain row (row 27 in output) has isolated 4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7 separated by 1s, matching expected chain preservation.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 20-25) has 2s only in columns 20-24, with left side all 1s—no vertical propagation or inter-fill into left bg areas, suggesting missed overlaps with upper mixed rows (e.g., row17 has colors up to col23, should overlap and fill gaps above row20 if chain links, but remains 1/bg? Output shows 1s, implying no fill triggered—perhaps get_inner picks a row without left colors).
 * Gaps between sections (e.g., rows 4-9 between row3 and row10 seeds) are fully 2-filled horizontally, which seems correct if upper/lower inners overlap in cols 3,10,22 (where seeds are) and chain has 2-4/2-8 etc., but vertically in those columns, bg above/below seeds isn't filled (e.g., col3 row4=2, but if vertical prop within section, why not extend from seed? Sections may not include seed rows if they are full-mixed).
 * Row 0 and row 28 all 1s (top/bottom borders, correct untouched). Row 21 all 1s? Wait, output row20 is mixed 1s and 2s on right—looks like partial section. Overall, over-reliance on 2 suggests chain starts/bridges with 2, but scattered seeds in row17 (cols 3,9,11,15-16,18,22) aren't bridged horizontally in that row (gaps are 2s, but if multi-color, no fill—correct, but expected more inter-fill below).
 * The output makes sense for a 2-dominant fill but misses potential fills in left-lower areas and between scattered seeds, differing from expectation of fuller propagation if sections/overlaps are broader; unknown if input had more bg in lower left, but output leaves it as 1s (proto? or bg not filled—code sets bg to colors, but if input 1s, untouched).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a walled structure (using 1 as proto/walls) with background (likely 0) and colored regions (numbers like 2,3,4,...), where the goal is to fill empty background areas horizontally and vertically based on adjacency rules derived from a "chain" extracted from a key row near the bottom of the grid. The filling propagates colors between wall-separated regions only if the bordering colors are adjacent in the chain sequence, using the preceding or matching color from the chain to decide the fill color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background (bg) is identified from the last row's first cell, assumed to be 0 or empty; all fills target only bg cells without overwriting existing colors or walls.
 * The chain is a sequence of non-bg colors extracted from the second-to-last row (grid[n-2]), representing an ordering of colors that defines valid adjacencies for filling (e.g., colors must appear consecutively in the chain to allow propagation between regions).
 * Walls (proto=1) divide the grid into sections both vertically (stacks of wall rows) and horizontally (within rows); sections are contiguous blocks of rows with at least one proto in them.
 * Vertical filling occurs between non-adjacent vertical sections (with gap rows in between) by identifying "inner" rows in each section (first non-pure-proto/bg row), extracting uniform-color regions in those inners, and filling overlapping horizontal spans in the gap rows with a color from the chain if the bordering region colors are adjacent in the chain.
 * Horizontal filling happens within individual rows, between consecutive walls, filling bg in uniform-color regions if bordering colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Subtlety: Regions must be uniform single-color (no mixed colors within a wall-bounded segment) to be considered for filling; scattered same-color cells in a segment don't qualify unless contiguous (code uses min/max j of js, but assumes uniformity).
 * Adjacency in chain is symmetric but returns the "preceding" color based on order (if a then b, return a; if b then a, return b), which might imply directionality in propagation (e.g., fill with the earlier-in-chain color).
 * Easy to miss: Vertical sections skip the last two rows (while i < n-2), assuming the chain and bg rows are at the bottom and not part of sections; inner rows are chosen as the first row in a section with non-proto/bg content.
 * Gaps between sections must have no overlap in filling logic; if sections are adjacent (end1 +1 >= start2), no vertical fill.
 * Chain extraction ignores bg and proto, but assumes the row has meaningful sequence; if chain <2 elements, no filling.
 * Overwriting only bg; existing colors (like special numbers 3-9) stay, so fills don't propagate over pre-placed colors.
 * Grid dimensions: Assumes rectangular (n rows, m cols); early returns if n<3.
 * Potential edge case: Multiple regions per inner row; filling only where horizontal overlaps exist between upper/lower regions.
 * Chain may include duplicates (e.g., multiple 4's), allowing multiple adjacencies; is_adjacent_preceding checks for exact pairs in sequence, not just presence.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only shown) attempt; it successfully handled all three training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating solid core logic for basic vertical and horizontal filling between wall sections using chain adjacencies.
 * Worked well for identifying bg (0), extracting chain from second-last row, and finding vertical sections excluding bottom two rows.
 * Vertical fill correctly skips adjacent sections and only fills gaps where inner-row regions overlap horizontally and colors are chain-adjacent.
 * Horizontal fill properly identifies regions between walls in rows and fills if adjacent in chain, but only within the same row.
 * What didn't work/may be limited: get_inner_row picks only the first valid row in a section, potentially missing multi-row sections with varying inner content; if a section has no qualifying inner row (all proto/bg), skips entirely.
 * get_regions requires strictly uniform single color per inter-wall segment (set len==1), which works if regions are solid but may fail if input has pre-filled partials or mixed bg/colors; it also takes min/max of js but doesn't ensure full coverage (e.g., holes in region ignored).
 * is_adjacent_preceding is symmetric but biased toward the order in chain (returns the first in pair), which succeeded in training but might not handle reverse propagation or multi-hop chains.
 * No extraction of "objects" per se (e.g., full blobs or connected components); focuses on wall-bounded regions, which is helpful but assumes walls define all boundaries—may miss open areas without walls.
 * horizontal_fill re-extracts regions per row (redundant with get_regions) and uses index k of walls for positioning, which is functional but inefficient; it fills only between consecutive regions in the same row.
 * vertical_fill and horizontal_fill are applied sequentially (vert then horiz), which may overwrite or miss interactions if horiz creates new adjacencies for vert (but since copies grid, it's one-pass).
 * No handling for chain colors not present in regions (fills only if exact match); assumes proto=1 fixed, bg dynamic.
 * Overall, attempt shows good understanding of wall-section-chain rules but may underfill in complex test cases with multi-layer sections or non-uniform inners.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 29x29 grid (inferred from lists) with heavy use of 1's as walls/borders, large areas filled with 2's (likely the dominant chain color), and isolated special colors (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) placed in specific positions across rows 3,10,17,23, matching a pattern like staggered "key" placements vertically aligned with the bottom chain row 27: [1,4,1,8,1,9,1,4,1,7,1,6,1,9,1,4,1,5,1,3,1,7,...].
 * It looks partially correct: Upper sections (rows 0-6,8-13) are mostly 2-filled between walls with specials like 4,8,9,6,7,4 in row 3/10, suggesting vertical propagation of 2's where adjacent to chain (assuming 2 is prevalent in chain), and specials are preserved (not overwritten).
 * Middle section (rows 15-19) has expanded 2's in central columns (14-19) with specials 9,4,5,3, indicating horizontal/vertical fills triggered by chain adjacencies (e.g., if 2 adjacent to 9/4/5/3, fill 2 in overlaps).
 * Lower sections (rows 21-25) have narrower 2-fills (columns 20-24) with 7 in row 23, showing localized filling, possibly due to narrower wall sections or no overlap with upper regions.
 * What doesn't look correct: Many areas remain as 1's or potentially unfilled (though output shows no explicit 0's, assuming bg was 0 and filled to 2's where possible); for example, rows 1-2,4-5, etc., mirror row structures but fill only 2's around specials without propagating the specials themselves upward/downward—e.g., the 4 in row 3 col 3 isn't filled vertically into row 2 col 3 (still 2?), suggesting vertical_fill didn't trigger for that pair (perhaps no chain adjacency between 4 and bordering 2, or no gap/overlap). Similarly, central expansions in rows 15-19 seem correct, but lower partial fills (only cols 20-24) differ from upper full-width 2's, possibly missing vertical propagation across full horizontal span if chain doesn't support wider overlaps. Bottom rows 26-28 are all 1's except the chain in 27, which is preserved correctly. Overall, it makes sense for a chain-heavy-2 puzzle but appears incomplete in propagating specials (e.g., no 4/8/9 fills beyond their input positions), which might be expected if the puzzle requires filling gaps with adjacent chain colors including specials; unknown if input had these specials pre-placed or if filling should expand them—differs from expectation of fuller special propagation if chain allows (e.g., if 4 adjacent to 2, why not fill more 4's?).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 22:10:13] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based filling puzzle where proto (1) represents walls or barriers, bg is the background/empty color (likely 0 in input, appearing as unfilled or default like 2 in output), and a chain of distinct colors is extracted from the second-to-last row to guide filling. The program fills bg cells horizontally within rows based on existing color clues and chain adjacency rules, and vertically in gaps between "key" sections of rows containing chain colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Walls (proto=1) divide rows into segments; filling only occurs in bg cells, skipping proto.
 * Chain is the sequence of non-bg non-proto colors in row n-2, used to validate adjacency: if two colors a and b are consecutive in chain (in either order), fill gaps with the preceding color in the pair; if a==b, fill with a (this allows propagation of non-chain colors like 2, which is a subtlety that can cause over-filling).
 * Horizontal filling processes each row independently: identify segments between walls, uniform-ize segments with a single clue color c (!=bg, !=proto), then fill bg in gaps between consecutive uniform segments if their colors are adjacent/same in chain.
 * Vertical filling occurs in row gaps between sections, per column: extract unique color from upper/lower section in that column (ignoring bg/proto), fill gap rows' bg/proto cells with preceding color if upper/lower colors are adjacent/same in chain.
 * Bg determination: most common non-proto color in top n-2 rows; this can be 2 if input has many 2's, treating 2 as fillable bg, but output shows 2's persisting where unfilled.
 * Sections are consecutive rows <n-2 with mixed proto and non-proto; subtle issue: this includes "empty" rows with only bg and proto (e.g., uniform 2's with walls), merging them into sections and eliminating gaps, preventing vertical fills—sections should instead require at least one non-bg non-proto color to isolate key rows with chain-based clues.
 * Input likely has sparse clues (single cells of chain colors in key rows), walls (1's), and bg (0 or 2); program propagates from clues but leaves unfilled areas as 2 (or bg), which may appear as default shading.
 * Proto cells in gaps aren't filled vertically (only bg), preserving walls.
 * Chain order matters for "preceding" fill color; symmetric check (a-b or b-a) but returns the earlier in chain.
 * Edge cases: empty chain/grid, single-row sections, columns with no upper/lower color (None, skip fill), all-proto rows (skipped as sections).
 * Subtle: horizontal gap fills can span multiple empty segments between walls if consecutive components exist, but only bg cells; this over-propagates same-color (e.g., 2) across proto-separated areas if a==b.

        else:
            i += 1
    return sections
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the provided (last) attempt; successfully handled training examples 1-3 by correctly filling horizontal segments from clues and propagating via chain adjacency, leaving unfilled areas appropriately.
 * Worked well for horizontal logic in key rows, matching chain subsequences (e.g., 4-8-9, 9-4-5-3) by uniformizing segments and filling gaps.
 * Failed to perform any vertical filling in test due to broken find_sections merging all rows (including 2-filled rows) into one massive section, as mixed proto/bg rows are treated as sections.
 * Incorrectly propagated non-chain color 2 horizontally in rows 15-16, filling col 14-18 (an empty segment between 2-components at 8-12 and 20-24) with 2 via a==b rule, despite 2 not in chain— this over-shading is a new bug exposed by test structure.
 * extract_chain and horizontal_fill are essential and correct for initial segment filling from input clues.
 * is_adjacent_preceding enables same-color propagation, which worked in training but is problematic for default colors like 2 in test (consider restricting to chain colors).
 * get_section_color is correct but unused in test due to no gaps.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this builds understanding of chain-based adjacency for both horizontal/vertical; training success indicates core logic is close, but section definition and same-color fill are key misses.

**Test output:**
 * The test output correctly fills key rows (e.g., row 3 with 4/8/9 segments, row 10 with 6/7/4, row 17 with 9/4/5/3, row 23 with 7) matching non-consecutive subsequences of chain [4,8,9,4,7,6,9,4,5,3,7], via horizontal uniformization and gap filling from input clues.
 * Intermediate rows (e.g., 1-2,4-5,8-9,11-12,18-19,21-22,24-25) correctly leave as 2's in standard segments (cols 1-5/8-12/20-24) where no clues or propagation occurred, preserving input/default shading.
 * Rows 15-16 incorrectly add extra 2's in cols 14-18 (middle segment), propagated from adjacent 2-components via a==b rule; this over-fills an area that should remain bg or get vertical color (e.g., 4 or 5 from nearby chain), making it look incorrect—expected to be empty or chain-propagated, not extended 2-shading.
 * No vertical filling at all (e.g., rows 11-16 between row 10's 6/7/4 and row 17's 9/4/5/3 should propagate e.g., 6 to 9 adjacency filling cols 1-5 with 6, 4 to 4 with 4, but remain 2's), due to merged sections; this leaves large areas as uniform 2's instead of patterned chain colors, confirming output does not match expected (test looks mostly 2-shaded with isolated key rows, lacking vertical connections).
 * Row 0/26/29 all 1's (proto) correct and untouched; chain row (27) unchanged as input; overall, output makes partial sense for horizontal but fails vertical integration, appearing incomplete/under-filled except for the bug in 15-16.
 * Bg likely 0 in input (filled to 2 only where propagated), but persistent 2's suggest input pre-has 2's in non-key areas, which program doesn't override without clues/propagation.
