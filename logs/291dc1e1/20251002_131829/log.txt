=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 13:18:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 13:33:20] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids represent labeled patterns of colored blocks (numbers 1-9, with 8 as empty space), and the goal is to extract, process, and re-render these patterns into a simplified output grid by removing labels, handling horizontal or vertical runs, and rendering bands or groups with padding and main colors, distinguishing between "wide" (horizontal-focused) and "tall" (vertical band-focused) modes based on grid width after label removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids start with a label column (containing 0 for the relevant pattern) that must be identified and removed before processing; ignoring this leads to polluted outputs.
 * Mode selection is critical: if width >7 after removal, use "wide mode" to group repeated rows, extract horizontal runs of length >=2 (skipping 8s), find max run length for padding, and render centered blocks vertically stacked by group height; if <=7, use "tall mode" with fixed content columns [1,2,4,5] (implying columns 0 and 3,6+ are spacers or labels), process left band [1,2] and right band [4,5] separately.
 * In tall mode, groups are vertical stretches of non-8 content in bands; compute main color as most frequent non-8 in the group; for height=2 groups, render specially (e.g., full main color top row, mixed or padded bottom); for taller groups, render top and bottom layers based on band runs, reversing run order for rendering, and pad to max vertical run width.
 * Padding is always centered with 8s: left pad = (max_size - content) // 2, right = remainder; runs of 8s are skipped, not rendered.
 * Output rows come in pairs (duplicated for height representation?); full-width solid rows (no 8s) are rendered as-is, duplicated.
 * Subtle: In band rendering, extract runs horizontally within band columns, reverse them for output order; special case for single mixed position in h=2 where non-main differing colors get prioritized in a 2-cell block; empty or all-8 groups are skipped.
 * Vertical runs for max_w ignore 8s and compute max consecutive non-8 in content columns; horizontal runs in wide mode skip 8s but count consecutive same non-8.
 * Easy to miss: Order of output matters—left band before right in tall mode, but within bands, groups processed top-to-bottom; in training 4, this led to reordered blocks (e.g., full 3s before 4s/7s/3s).
 * All-8 rows are skipped in grouping; group height is consecutive identical non-all-8 rows.
 * Outputs are always even height (paired rows), padded to consistent width.

(Note: Functions like build_wide_output, process_band, render_group_h2, render_group_hgt, and render_layer from the attempt are helpful for rendering but have bugs in ordering/special cases; use as base but fix. No types defined, but Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int,int]]] for groups is useful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 1-3: CORRECT, indicating solid handling of wide mode (horizontal runs, grouping, centered padding) and basic tall mode band separation for simpler cases.
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT; generated output reorders blocks (starts with full-width 3s, then 7s pair, 3s pair, 4s pair, another 3s pair, 6s full, 9s pair; ends with misplaced 3s), while expected has 4s pair first, then 3s/7s/full 3s/9s/full 6s/3s—suggests failure in top-to-bottom group ordering within bands or left/right concatenation, possibly due to incorrect group start detection or main color influencing wrong rendering priority.
 * What worked: Label removal, mode detection (w>7), run extraction (skipping 8s, min length 2), padding logic, duplication of rows for height, main color computation, special h=2 rendering (though not triggered here).
 * What didn't: In tall mode, process_band likely processes groups out of order or mishandles full-width solids vs. banded; render_layer reverses runs but may not align top/bottom correctly for taller groups; no handling for why full 3s appear early (perhaps misgrouped as left band).
 * Helpful: extract_runs_from_row and find_pattern_groups work well for wide mode; get_max_vertical_run useful for padding.
 * Unhelpful/broken: render_group_hgt assumes fixed h_layer=2 for layers but may not scale; the special_pos logic in h=2 is overly complex and fails if multiple mixes without clear non-main diff (leads to generic padding that scrambles order); overall program() concatenation left+right works for simple but not when bands have asymmetric groups (e.g., one band full-width, other banded).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it has 18 rows (uneven, but should be paired), irregular widths (all 6 elems, ok), but mixes incompatible colors in single rows like [8,3,3,7,7,8] (3s and 7s adjacent, impossible if bands are separate) and [9,7,7,7,7,7]/[7,7,7,7,7,7] (9 mixed into 7s full-width?), suggesting band processing bleeds left/right or wrong column selection.
 * Duplicated pairs are inconsistent (e.g., [8,8,5,5,8,8] twice ok, but [8,3,3,3,3,8] once then varied); ends with repeated [8,8,4,4,8,8] pair, implying duplicate group detection.
 * Missing expected structure: No clear left/right separation (e.g., [8,3,3,7,7,8] mashes left 3s with right 7s); full-width like [9,7,...] shouldn't mix; likely fails on test's complex vertical mixes or taller groups, producing garbage where runs aren't properly extracted/reversed/padded.
 * Does not make sense overall—puzzle rules imply clean banded or run-based blocks without intra-row color clashes unless special h=2 mix, but here it's rampant; need to verify content_cols [1,2,4,5] assumption holds for test grid (unknown without input grid, but output suggests col indexing error post-removal).

[2025-10-02 13:33:20] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 13:46:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels where 1-9 are colors and 8 is background/empty space) to extract and re-render structured "blocks" or "objects" (such as shapes, bars, or symbols) into a new output grid. The goal appears to be isolating meaningful visual elements from the input, handling their vertical and horizontal structure, padding them appropriately with 8s, and arranging or duplicating them to form a coherent output image, often with fixed-width rows (e.g., 6 elements) that may include multiple elements side-by-side or varying heights.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input grids likely contain borders, separators (e.g., all-8 rows or columns), or framing elements (possibly involving 0s or edges) that need to be trimmed or ignored to extract the core drawing—e.g., removing left/right columns based on edge values like 0 or non-8 starts.
 * Objects/blocks are not just simple horizontal runs; they can span multiple rows with varying heights (e.g., single rows for irregular shapes, double rows for thick lines/bars), so vertical structure must be preserved rather than flattening everything into duplicated pairs.
 * Horizontal runs of the same non-8 color should be extracted, but only as part of larger multi-row objects—ignoring isolated 8s is good, but skipping all-8 rows without extracting adjacent content can miss context.
 * Rendering involves centering/padding blocks to a maximum width (e.g., 6 in examples) with 8s on both sides, but multiple blocks may need to be composed side-by-side in the same row(s) rather than rendered separately.
 * Duplication of rows only applies to certain elements (e.g., horizontal bars like [8,8,4,4,8,8] are duplicated, but irregular shapes like [1,2,6,6,6,6] or [7,4,7,7,7,7] appear as single rows), suggesting detection of "solid" vs. "detailed" blocks.
 * Subtle elements: Handle cases where rows are identical (e.g., thick lines) by consuming both without redundant output; avoid over-duplicating everything, as this fragments the image; account for asymmetric padding or non-centered placement in some cases; the output may represent a "key" or arranged symbols, so order and adjacency matter (e.g., placing shapes next to each other without extra 8 separators unless specified).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided): The approach correctly identifies some simple, uniform blocks in train2/3 (likely single or paired identical rows), but fails on complex multi-row or side-by-side compositions in train1/4; test input shows extreme fragmentation, indicating over-reliance on horizontal runs without vertical grouping.
 * General considerations: Max width should be consistent across the output (e.g., 6), not per-block; empty or all-8 sections should be fully omitted, not rendered; potential for 0s as special (e.g., borders to trim), though not seen in outputs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_runs(row: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts consecutive runs of non-8 colors, ignoring 8s—useful for compressing uniform segments within a row,
    # but should be applied per object, not globally, to avoid breaking multi-row structures.
    runs = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != 8:
            color = row[i]
            start = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            run = [color] * (i - start)
            runs.append(run)
        else:
            i += 1
    return runs
```

```python
def get_max_w(blocks: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Computes max length of block rows—helpful for consistent padding, but blocks need to be properly defined first.
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    return max(len(b) for b in blocks)
```

```python
def pad_line(line: List[int], max_w: int) -> List[int]:
    # Centers a line/block with 8s—useful for background filling, but apply after composing full rows, not to tiny runs.
    w = len(line)
    if w == max_w:
        return line
    pad_left = (max_w - w) // 2
    pad_right = max_w - w - pad_left
    return [8] * pad_left + line + [8] * pad_right
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future attempts):**
- `get_drawing`: Attempts to trim edges based on first row's start (0 vs. non-0), but logic is flawed/incomplete—e.g., it removes entire columns from subsequent rows without checking consistency, leading to distorted grids; doesn't handle top/bottom borders or verify if 0s are actually present; not robust for varied inputs.
- `get_blocks`: Breaks on multi-row complexity—e.g., only handles pairs of identical rows by extracting runs once and skipping, but treats single rows the same way, resulting in flat lists of tiny runs instead of preserved 2D objects; skips all-8 rows correctly but doesn't group non-identical adjacent rows into taller blocks; outputs a flat list unsuitable for vertical rendering.
- `render_blocks`: Forces every block into duplicated pairs, which works for simple bars (train2/3) but over-duplicates irregular shapes (e.g., turns a single detailed row into two identical ones); renders each run separately instead of composing into full-width rows with multiple elements side-by-side.
- Overall `program`: Chains the above, so inherits all flaws—produces narrow, fragmented outputs instead of full images.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled simple cases (train2/3 passed), likely uniform bars or single objects, by extracting runs and duplicating for thickness.
 * Missed preserving vertical structure in complex inputs (train1/4 incorrect)—e.g., in train1, generated narrow 2-wide duplicated runs like [4,4]/[9,9] scattered, but expected full 6-wide rows with side-by-side elements (e.g., [8,8,4,4,8,8] duplicated, then non-duplicated [1,2,6,6,6,6] and [7,4,7,7,7,7]/[4,7,7,7,7,7] showing shape details).
 * In train4, generated reordered/fragmented blocks like duplicated [3,3,3,3,3,3] early and [8,4,4,4,4,8] mid, but expected specific order with [3,3,3,3,3,3] duplicated later, [8,3,3,3,3,8] at end, and no fragmentation—difference in block grouping and placement (unknown why order shifted, possibly from flawed row-skipping).
 * extract_runs is partially helpful for horizontal compression but insufficient alone, as it ignores vertical context—essential to combine with 2D object detection.
 * get_blocks over-skips or misgroups rows (e.g., treats non-identical rows as separate tiny blocks), leading to loss of adjacency (e.g., train1's [8,6,6,3,3,8]/[8,3,3,3,3,8] became scattered [6,8]/[3,8] pairs).
 * Train1 mismatches overall composition: generated ~40 narrow lines vs. expected 12 full rows; shapes like [1,2,6,6,6,6] lost (unknown how input represented it, but program didn't capture mixed colors in rows).
 * Train4 has position errors: e.g., [8,8,7,7,8,8] appears early in generated but mid in expected; [8,3,3,3,3,8] missing entirely in generated (possibly skipped as non-paired).
 * Function `get_drawing` is broken for non-edge cases—may distort grids unnecessarily (e.g., if no 0s, removes wrong columns).
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of runs/padding but fails core 2D extraction.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is highly fragmented into ~40 narrow (mostly 2-wide) duplicated rows like [3,3]x2, [4,4]x2, [6,8]x2, [7,8]x2, [9,9]x6 (over-duplicated at end), with scattered singles like [5,5]x2, resembling disassembled pixels rather than a coherent image.
 * It lacks full-width composition (e.g., no 6-wide rows with multiple elements side-by-side or proper padding); order seems arbitrary/jumbled (e.g., [3,3] repeats early, [9,9] bloated at end), missing expected structure like arranged symbols or scenes.
 * Compared to train examples, it over-applies duplication (e.g., six [9,9] rows vs. expected pairs) and ignores vertical grouping (e.g., potential taller [6,6] stacks reduced to pairs); does not make sense as a visual puzzle output—looks like raw run extraction without reassembly, so likely incorrect for test input (unknown exact expected, but pattern suggests full rows with shapes like bars, blobs, or keys).
 * To handle test: Need better object detection (e.g., flood-fill or bounding boxes for connected non-8 regions) and row-level composition to avoid this; account for potential long runs or multi-color rows in test.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future attempts):**
- `get_drawing`: Attempts to trim edges based on first row's start (0 vs. non-0), but logic is flawed/incomplete—e.g., it removes entire columns from subsequent rows without checking consistency, leading to distorted grids; doesn't handle top/bottom borders or verify if 0s are actually present; not robust for varied inputs.
- `get_blocks`: Breaks on multi-row complexity—e.g., only handles pairs of identical rows by extracting runs once and skipping, but treats single rows the same way, resulting in flat lists of tiny runs instead of preserved 2D objects; skips all-8 rows correctly but doesn't group non-identical adjacent rows into taller blocks; outputs a flat list unsuitable for vertical rendering.
- `render_blocks`: Forces every block into duplicated pairs, which works for simple bars (train2/3) but over-duplicates irregular shapes (e.g., turns a single detailed row into two identical ones); renders each run separately instead of composing into full-width rows with multiple elements side-by-side.
- Overall `program`: Chains the above, so inherits all flaws—produces narrow, fragmented outputs instead of full images.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled simple cases (train2/3 passed), likely uniform bars or single objects, by extracting runs and duplicating for thickness.
 * Missed preserving vertical structure in complex inputs (train1/4 incorrect)—e.g., in train1, generated narrow 2-wide duplicated runs like [4,4]/[9,9] scattered, but expected full 6-wide rows with side-by-side elements (e.g., [8,8,4,4,8,8] duplicated, then non-duplicated [1,2,6,6,6,6] and [7,4,7,7,7,7]/[4,7,7,7,7,7] showing shape details).
 * In train4, generated reordered/fragmented blocks like duplicated [3,3,3,3,3,3] early and [8,4,4,4,4,8] mid, but expected specific order with [3,3,3,3,3,3] duplicated later, [8,3,3,3,3,8] at end, and no fragmentation—difference in block grouping and placement (unknown why order shifted, possibly from flawed row-skipping).
 * extract_runs is partially helpful for horizontal compression but insufficient alone, as it ignores vertical context—essential to combine with 2D object detection.
 * get_blocks over-skips or misgroups rows (e.g., treats non-identical rows as separate tiny blocks), leading to loss of adjacency (e.g., train1's [8,6,6,3,3,8]/[8,3,3,3,3,8] became scattered [6,8]/[3,8] pairs).
 * Train1 mismatches overall composition: generated ~40 narrow lines vs. expected 12 full rows; shapes like [1,2,6,6,6,6] lost (unknown how input represented it, but program didn't capture mixed colors in rows).
 * Train4 has position errors: e.g., [8,8,7,7,8,8] appears early in generated but mid in expected; [8,3,3,3,3,8] missing entirely in generated (possibly skipped as non-paired).
 * Function `get_drawing` is broken for non-edge cases—may distort grids unnecessarily (e.g., if no 0s, removes wrong columns).
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of runs/padding but fails core 2D extraction.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is highly fragmented into ~40 narrow (mostly 2-wide) duplicated rows like [3,3]x2, [4,4]x2, [6,8]x2, [7,8]x2, [9,9]x6 (over-duplicated at end), with scattered singles like [5,5]x2, resembling disassembled pixels rather than a coherent image.
 * It lacks full-width composition (e.g., no 6-wide rows with multiple elements side-by-side or proper padding); order seems arbitrary/jumbled (e.g., [3,3] repeats early, [9,9] bloated at end), missing expected structure like arranged symbols or scenes.
 * Compared to train examples, it over-applies duplication (e.g., six [9,9] rows vs. expected pairs) and ignores vertical grouping (e.g., potential taller [6,6] stacks reduced to pairs); does not make sense as a visual puzzle output—looks like raw run extraction without reassembly, so likely incorrect for test input (unknown exact expected, but pattern suggests full rows with shapes like bars, blobs, or keys).
 * To handle test: Need better object detection (e.g., flood-fill or bounding boxes for connected non-8 regions) and row-level composition to avoid this; account for potential long runs or multi-color rows in test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids represent labeled patterns of colored blocks (numbers 1-9, with 8 as empty space), and the goal is to extract, process, and re-render these patterns into a simplified output grid by removing labels, handling horizontal or vertical runs, and rendering bands or groups with padding and main colors, distinguishing between "wide" (horizontal-focused) and "tall" (vertical band-focused) modes based on grid width after label removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids start with a label column (containing 0 for the relevant pattern) that must be identified and removed before processing; ignoring this leads to polluted outputs.
 * Mode selection is critical: if width >7 after removal, use "wide mode" to group repeated rows, extract horizontal runs of length >=2 (skipping 8s), find max run length for padding, and render centered blocks vertically stacked by group height; if <=7, use "tall mode" with fixed content columns [1,2,4,5] (implying columns 0 and 3,6+ are spacers or labels), process left band [1,2] and right band [4,5] separately.
 * In tall mode, groups are vertical stretches of non-8 content in bands; compute main color as most frequent non-8 in the group; for height=2 groups, render specially (e.g., full main color top row, mixed or padded bottom); for taller groups, render top and bottom layers based on band runs, reversing run order for rendering, and pad to max vertical run width.
 * Padding is always centered with 8s: left pad = (max_size - content) // 2, right = remainder; runs of 8s are skipped, not rendered.
 * Output rows come in pairs (duplicated for height representation?); full-width solid rows (no 8s) are rendered as-is, duplicated.
 * Subtle: In band rendering, extract runs horizontally within band columns, reverse them for output order; special case for single mixed position in h=2 where non-main differing colors get prioritized in a 2-cell block; empty or all-8 groups are skipped.
 * Vertical runs for max_w ignore 8s and compute max consecutive non-8 in content columns; horizontal runs in wide mode skip 8s but count consecutive same non-8.
 * Easy to miss: Order of output matters—left band before right in tall mode, but within bands, groups processed top-to-bottom; in training 4, this led to reordered blocks (e.g., full 3s before 4s/7s/3s).
 * All-8 rows are skipped in grouping; group height is consecutive identical non-all-8 rows.
 * Outputs are always even height (paired rows), padded to consistent width.

(Note: Functions like build_wide_output, process_band, render_group_h2, render_group_hgt, and render_layer from the attempt are helpful for rendering but have bugs in ordering/special cases; use as base but fix. No types defined, but Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int,int]]] for groups is useful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 1-3: CORRECT, indicating solid handling of wide mode (horizontal runs, grouping, centered padding) and basic tall mode band separation for simpler cases.
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT; generated output reorders blocks (starts with full-width 3s, then 7s pair, 3s pair, 4s pair, another 3s pair, 6s full, 9s pair; ends with misplaced 3s), while expected has 4s pair first, then 3s/7s/full 3s/9s/full 6s/3s—suggests failure in top-to-bottom group ordering within bands or left/right concatenation, possibly due to incorrect group start detection or main color influencing wrong rendering priority.
 * What worked: Label removal, mode detection (w>7), run extraction (skipping 8s, min length 2), padding logic, duplication of rows for height, main color computation, special h=2 rendering (though not triggered here).
 * What didn't: In tall mode, process_band likely processes groups out of order or mishandles full-width solids vs. banded; render_layer reverses runs but may not align top/bottom correctly for taller groups; no handling for why full 3s appear early (perhaps misgrouped as left band).
 * Helpful: extract_runs_from_row and find_pattern_groups work well for wide mode; get_max_vertical_run useful for padding.
 * Unhelpful/broken: render_group_hgt assumes fixed h_layer=2 for layers but may not scale; the special_pos logic in h=2 is overly complex and fails if multiple mixes without clear non-main diff (leads to generic padding that scrambles order); overall program() concatenation left+right works for simple but not when bands have asymmetric groups (e.g., one band full-width, other banded).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it has 18 rows (uneven, but should be paired), irregular widths (all 6 elems, ok), but mixes incompatible colors in single rows like [8,3,3,7,7,8] (3s and 7s adjacent, impossible if bands are separate) and [9,7,7,7,7,7]/[7,7,7,7,7,7] (9 mixed into 7s full-width?), suggesting band processing bleeds left/right or wrong column selection.
 * Duplicated pairs are inconsistent (e.g., [8,8,5,5,8,8] twice ok, but [8,3,3,3,3,8] once then varied); ends with repeated [8,8,4,4,8,8] pair, implying duplicate group detection.
 * Missing expected structure: No clear left/right separation (e.g., [8,3,3,7,7,8] mashes left 3s with right 7s); full-width like [9,7,...] shouldn't mix; likely fails on test's complex vertical mixes or taller groups, producing garbage where runs aren't properly extracted/reversed/padded.
 * Does not make sense overall—puzzle rules imply clean banded or run-based blocks without intra-row color clashes unless special h=2 mix, but here it's rampant; need to verify content_cols [1,2,4,5] assumption holds for test grid (unknown without input grid, but output suggests col indexing error post-removal).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 13:55:05] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where 8 represents empty space and other numbers represent filled cells or bars. The goal is to parse the grid (removing a label column indicated by 0 in the header row), detect if the content is "wide" (horizontal run extraction and rendering) or "tall" (vertical band-based sequence extraction and rendering), extract runs or sequences of identical non-8 values (skipping 8s), and output normalized, centered representations as new rows of bars or sequences padded with 8s to a maximum length/height, repeated for group heights, while preserving or reordering based on implicit rules like direction (left/right label position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid has a header row with a 0 marking the label column position; this column is removed entirely, and the header row is skipped, leaving only content rows for processing.
 * Direction reversal: If the label column is on the right half (label_col > (width-1)/2), reverse processing order (e.g., swap left/right bands, reverse run extraction) to match visual orientation.
 * For "wide" grids (width after removal >7): Group identical consecutive rows (skipping all-8 rows), extract horizontal runs of identical non-8 values (min length 2), render each run as a centered bar of that value padded with 8s to the max run length across all groups, and repeat the bar for the group's height; process groups in top-to-bottom order without sorting.
 * For "tall" grids (width after removal <=7): Assume a structure with content in specific columns (e.g., [1,2] left band, [4,5] right band, possibly ignoring 0,3,6 as spacers/labels); extract vertical sequences per band group (consecutive rows with activity in the band), render left and right column sequences separately as padded rows (to max vertical run height), appending right then left (or swapped if reversed) for each group in top-to-bottom order; all-8 rows are skipped in grouping.
 * Runs/sequences ignore 8s (treat as gaps, not part of runs); only include runs of length >=2 for wide mode.
 * Padding is always centered: (max_len - actual_len) // 2 on left, remainder on right; full-width bars (no padding needed) are output as-is without extra 8s.
 * Output is a flat list of rows, each a list of ints matching the computed width (6 for padded bars in examples, but varies by max run/height).
 * Subtle ordering: Groups are processed in appearance order, but mismatches in training 4 suggest possible need for sorting by label values, band position, or visual prominence (e.g., full-width bars may need repositioning); reversal affects band order but not group internal order.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid after removal returns []; all-8 groups are skipped; min run length 2 avoids single cells; vertical max run defaults to 1 if no runs.
 * Potential bugs: In tall mode, assuming fixed band columns [1,2]/[4,5] may not generalize if grid width varies (e.g., test has irregular outputs suggesting column misalignment); skipping header via [1:] assumes it's always row 0.
 * No rotation or transposition mentioned, but reversal implies handling mirrored inputs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_label_col(header: List[int]) -> int:
    return header.index(0)
```
(Finds the position of the label column marker in the header row.)

```python
def remove_col(grid: List[List[int]], col: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[row[j] for j in range(len(row)) if j != col] for row in grid]
```
(Removes the specified column from the entire grid, preserving row structure.)

```python
def is_all8(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(x == 8 for x in row)
```
(Checks if a row is entirely empty (8s), useful for skipping in grouping.)

```python
def extract_runs(row: List[int], reverse_dir: bool = False, min_len: int = 2) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if reverse_dir:
        row = row[::-1]
    runs = []
    j = 0
    w = len(row)
    while j < w:
        if row[j] == 8:
            j += 1
            continue
        c = row[j]
        l = 1
        j += 1
        while j < w and row[j] == c:
            l += 1
            j += 1
        if l >= min_len:
            runs.append((c, l))
    if reverse_dir:
        runs = runs[::-1]
    return runs
```
(Extracts consecutive non-8 runs from a row as (value, length) tuples, skipping 8s as gaps, with optional reversal and min length filter; reverses results if needed to maintain original order post-reversal.)

```python
def find_groups(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[int]]]:
    groups = []
    i = 0
    h = len(grid)
    while i < h:
        if is_all8(grid[i]):
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        row = grid[i]
        i += 1
        while i < h and grid[i] == row:
            i += 1
        groups.append((i - start, row))
    return groups
```
(Groups consecutive identical non-all-8 rows, returning (height, row_sample) for each group; skips all-8 rows.)

```python
def render_bar(c: int, length: int, max_w: int) -> List[int]:
    pad_l = (max_w - length) // 2
    pad_r = max_w - length - pad_l
    return [8] * pad_l + [c] * length + [8] * pad_r
```
(Centers a bar of value c and given length in a row of max_w, padding with 8s.)

```python
def render_seq(seq: List[int], max_w: int) -> List[int]:
    ln = len(seq)
    if ln == max_w:
        return seq[:]
    pad_l = (max_w - ln) // 2
    pad_r = max_w - ln - pad_l
    return [8] * pad_l + seq + [8] * pad_r
```
(Pads a sequence vertically to max height with centered 8s, handling full-length cases without padding.)

```python
def get_max_vertical_run(grid: List[List[int]], content_cols: List[int]) -> int:
    max_r = 0
    h = len(grid)
    for col in content_cols:
        i = 0
        while i < h:
            if grid[i][col] == 8:
                i += 1
                continue
            c = grid[i][col]
            start = i
            i += 1
            while i < h and grid[i][col] == c:
                i += 1
            max_r = max(max_r, i - start)
    return max_r if max_r > 0 else 1
```
(Computes the maximum vertical run length of identical non-8 values across specified columns, skipping 8s; defaults to 1 if none.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 1-3: Correct, indicating solid handling of basic wide/tall detection, label removal, group extraction, run/sequence rendering, padding, repetition for heights, and direction reversal for simple cases.
 * Training example 4: Incorrect—generated output has wrong order of bars (starts with full-width 3s, then padded 7s, padded 3s, padded 4s, padded 3s, full 6s, padded 9s), while expected starts with padded 4s, padded 3s, padded 7s, full 3s, padded 9s, full 6s, padded 3s; some bars like full 3s are correctly unpadded, but overall sequence mismatches suggest failure to sort groups by label value, band position, or another implicit rule (e.g., visual top-to-bottom after reordering); the two full 3s and padded 3s are present but repositioned incorrectly.
 * The process_tall function appends right-seq then left-seq per group, which works for train 1-3 but may not handle interleaved or multi-group band ordering in train 4.
 * No explicit sorting in find_groups or band processing, which succeeds for sequential groups but fails when order needs adjustment (e.g., by prominence or label).
 * Function get_band_groups is helpful for vertical grouping but assumes fixed band columns; may break if test input has different structure.
 * The [1:] skip after remove_col works for header removal in all trains but could be fragile if header isn't always row 0.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hard-coded content_cols=[1,2,4,5] and bands may not generalize beyond 6-7 width grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—rows have inconsistent lengths (e.g., most are 6 elements like [8,8,4,4,8,8], but some like [3,3,3,3,3,7,3,3] and [3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7] are 8 elements with mixed values (3s and 7s in same row), violating the expected uniform padded bar/sequence format; this suggests a bug in rendering (e.g., incorrect padding calculation, failure to center properly, or column misalignment in tall mode leading to concatenated or unfiltered sequences).
 * Missing proper centering/padding in mixed rows (e.g., no 8s around the 3s/7s, and values not isolated as separate bars/sequences).
 * Order seems partially sequential (e.g., 4s, 3s, 6s, 9s appear), but corrupted by mixing (e.g., [8,6,6,3,3,8] blends 6s and 3s) and extras like [8,7,9,7,7,8]/[8,7,7,9,7,8] which may be failed band extractions; full 6s are correct, but overall it doesn't match a clean normalized output.
 * Likely fails due to assuming wrong columns for bands in test input (e.g., if width !=6 after removal, [1,2,4,5] indices may grab spacers or misalign); reversal or group skipping may also be mishandled, leading to non-8 values leaking into pads.
 * To handle test case, need dynamic band detection (e.g., based on non-8 activity) instead of hard-coded columns, and stricter run extraction to avoid mixing values in a single row.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 13:55:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels where 1-9 are colors and 8 is background/empty space) to extract and re-render structured "blocks" or "objects" (such as shapes, bars, or symbols) into a new output grid. The goal appears to be isolating meaningful visual elements from the input, handling their vertical and horizontal structure, padding them appropriately with 8s, and arranging or duplicating them to form a coherent output image, often with fixed-width rows (e.g., 6 elements) that may include multiple elements side-by-side or varying heights.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input grids likely contain borders, separators (e.g., all-8 rows or columns), or framing elements (possibly involving 0s or edges) that need to be trimmed or ignored to extract the core drawing—e.g., removing left/right columns based on edge values like 0 or non-8 starts.
 * Objects/blocks are not just simple horizontal runs; they can span multiple rows with varying heights (e.g., single rows for irregular shapes, double rows for thick lines/bars), so vertical structure must be preserved rather than flattening everything into duplicated pairs.
 * Horizontal runs of the same non-8 color should be extracted, but only as part of larger multi-row objects—ignoring isolated 8s is good, but skipping all-8 rows without extracting adjacent content can miss context.
 * Rendering involves centering/padding blocks to a maximum width (e.g., 6 in examples) with 8s on both sides, but multiple blocks may need to be composed side-by-side in the same row(s) rather than rendered separately.
 * Duplication of rows only applies to certain elements (e.g., horizontal bars like [8,8,4,4,8,8] are duplicated, but irregular shapes like [1,2,6,6,6,6] or [7,4,7,7,7,7] appear as single rows), suggesting detection of "solid" vs. "detailed" blocks.
 * Subtle elements: Handle cases where rows are identical (e.g., thick lines) by consuming both without redundant output; avoid over-duplicating everything, as this fragments the image; account for asymmetric padding or non-centered placement in some cases; the output may represent a "key" or arranged symbols, so order and adjacency matter (e.g., placing shapes next to each other without extra 8 separators unless specified).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided): The approach correctly identifies some simple, uniform blocks in train2/3 (likely single or paired identical rows), but fails on complex multi-row or side-by-side compositions in train1/4; test input shows extreme fragmentation, indicating over-reliance on horizontal runs without vertical grouping.
 * General considerations: Max width should be consistent across the output (e.g., 6), not per-block; empty or all-8 sections should be fully omitted, not rendered; potential for 0s as special (e.g., borders to trim), though not seen in outputs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_runs(row: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts consecutive runs of non-8 colors, ignoring 8s—useful for compressing uniform segments within a row,
    # but should be applied per object, not globally, to avoid breaking multi-row structures.
    runs = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != 8:
            color = row[i]
            start = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            run = [color] * (i - start)
            runs.append(run)
        else:
            i += 1
    return runs
```

```python
def get_max_w(blocks: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Computes max length of block rows—helpful for consistent padding, but blocks need to be properly defined first.
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    return max(len(b) for b in blocks)
```

```python
def pad_line(line: List[int], max_w: int) -> List[int]:
    # Centers a line/block with 8s—useful for background filling, but apply after composing full rows, not to tiny runs.
    w = len(line)
    if w == max_w:
        return line
    pad_left = (max_w - w) // 2
    pad_right = max_w - w - pad_left
    return [8] * pad_left + line + [8] * pad_right
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future attempts):**
- `get_drawing`: Attempts to trim edges based on first row's start (0 vs. non-0), but logic is flawed/incomplete—e.g., it removes entire columns from subsequent rows without checking consistency, leading to distorted grids; doesn't handle top/bottom borders or verify if 0s are actually present; not robust for varied inputs.
- `get_blocks`: Breaks on multi-row complexity—e.g., only handles pairs of identical rows by extracting runs once and skipping, but treats single rows the same way, resulting in flat lists of tiny runs instead of preserved 2D objects; skips all-8 rows correctly but doesn't group non-identical adjacent rows into taller blocks; outputs a flat list unsuitable for vertical rendering.
- `render_blocks`: Forces every block into duplicated pairs, which works for simple bars (train2/3) but over-duplicates irregular shapes (e.g., turns a single detailed row into two identical ones); renders each run separately instead of composing into full-width rows with multiple elements side-by-side.
- Overall `program`: Chains the above, so inherits all flaws—produces narrow, fragmented outputs instead of full images.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled simple cases (train2/3 passed), likely uniform bars or single objects, by extracting runs and duplicating for thickness.
 * Missed preserving vertical structure in complex inputs (train1/4 incorrect)—e.g., in train1, generated narrow 2-wide duplicated runs like [4,4]/[9,9] scattered, but expected full 6-wide rows with side-by-side elements (e.g., [8,8,4,4,8,8] duplicated, then non-duplicated [1,2,6,6,6,6] and [7,4,7,7,7,7]/[4,7,7,7,7,7] showing shape details).
 * In train4, generated reordered/fragmented blocks like duplicated [3,3,3,3,3,3] early and [8,4,4,4,4,8] mid, but expected specific order with [3,3,3,3,3,3] duplicated later, [8,3,3,3,3,8] at end, and no fragmentation—difference in block grouping and placement (unknown why order shifted, possibly from flawed row-skipping).
 * extract_runs is partially helpful for horizontal compression but insufficient alone, as it ignores vertical context—essential to combine with 2D object detection.
 * get_blocks over-skips or misgroups rows (e.g., treats non-identical rows as separate tiny blocks), leading to loss of adjacency (e.g., train1's [8,6,6,3,3,8]/[8,3,3,3,3,8] became scattered [6,8]/[3,8] pairs).
 * Train1 mismatches overall composition: generated ~40 narrow lines vs. expected 12 full rows; shapes like [1,2,6,6,6,6] lost (unknown how input represented it, but program didn't capture mixed colors in rows).
 * Train4 has position errors: e.g., [8,8,7,7,8,8] appears early in generated but mid in expected; [8,3,3,3,3,8] missing entirely in generated (possibly skipped as non-paired).
 * Function `get_drawing` is broken for non-edge cases—may distort grids unnecessarily (e.g., if no 0s, removes wrong columns).
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of runs/padding but fails core 2D extraction.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is highly fragmented into ~40 narrow (mostly 2-wide) duplicated rows like [3,3]x2, [4,4]x2, [6,8]x2, [7,8]x2, [9,9]x6 (over-duplicated at end), with scattered singles like [5,5]x2, resembling disassembled pixels rather than a coherent image.
 * It lacks full-width composition (e.g., no 6-wide rows with multiple elements side-by-side or proper padding); order seems arbitrary/jumbled (e.g., [3,3] repeats early, [9,9] bloated at end), missing expected structure like arranged symbols or scenes.
 * Compared to train examples, it over-applies duplication (e.g., six [9,9] rows vs. expected pairs) and ignores vertical grouping (e.g., potential taller [6,6] stacks reduced to pairs); does not make sense as a visual puzzle output—looks like raw run extraction without reassembly, so likely incorrect for test input (unknown exact expected, but pattern suggests full rows with shapes like bars, blobs, or keys).
 * To handle test: Need better object detection (e.g., flood-fill or bounding boxes for connected non-8 regions) and row-level composition to avoid this; account for potential long runs or multi-color rows in test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids represent labeled patterns of colored blocks (numbers 1-9, with 8 as empty space), and the goal is to extract, process, and re-render these patterns into a simplified output grid by removing labels, handling horizontal or vertical runs, and rendering bands or groups with padding and main colors, distinguishing between "wide" (horizontal-focused) and "tall" (vertical band-focused) modes based on grid width after label removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids start with a label column (containing 0 for the relevant pattern) that must be identified and removed before processing; ignoring this leads to polluted outputs.
 * Mode selection is critical: if width >7 after removal, use "wide mode" to group repeated rows, extract horizontal runs of length >=2 (skipping 8s), find max run length for padding, and render centered blocks vertically stacked by group height; if <=7, use "tall mode" with fixed content columns [1,2,4,5] (implying columns 0 and 3,6+ are spacers or labels), process left band [1,2] and right band [4,5] separately.
 * In tall mode, groups are vertical stretches of non-8 content in bands; compute main color as most frequent non-8 in the group; for height=2 groups, render specially (e.g., full main color top row, mixed or padded bottom); for taller groups, render top and bottom layers based on band runs, reversing run order for rendering, and pad to max vertical run width.
 * Padding is always centered with 8s: left pad = (max_size - content) // 2, right = remainder; runs of 8s are skipped, not rendered.
 * Output rows come in pairs (duplicated for height representation?); full-width solid rows (no 8s) are rendered as-is, duplicated.
 * Subtle: In band rendering, extract runs horizontally within band columns, reverse them for output order; special case for single mixed position in h=2 where non-main differing colors get prioritized in a 2-cell block; empty or all-8 groups are skipped.
 * Vertical runs for max_w ignore 8s and compute max consecutive non-8 in content columns; horizontal runs in wide mode skip 8s but count consecutive same non-8.
 * Easy to miss: Order of output matters—left band before right in tall mode, but within bands, groups processed top-to-bottom; in training 4, this led to reordered blocks (e.g., full 3s before 4s/7s/3s).
 * All-8 rows are skipped in grouping; group height is consecutive identical non-all-8 rows.
 * Outputs are always even height (paired rows), padded to consistent width.

(Note: Functions like build_wide_output, process_band, render_group_h2, render_group_hgt, and render_layer from the attempt are helpful for rendering but have bugs in ordering/special cases; use as base but fix. No types defined, but Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int,int]]] for groups is useful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 1-3: CORRECT, indicating solid handling of wide mode (horizontal runs, grouping, centered padding) and basic tall mode band separation for simpler cases.
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT; generated output reorders blocks (starts with full-width 3s, then 7s pair, 3s pair, 4s pair, another 3s pair, 6s full, 9s pair; ends with misplaced 3s), while expected has 4s pair first, then 3s/7s/full 3s/9s/full 6s/3s—suggests failure in top-to-bottom group ordering within bands or left/right concatenation, possibly due to incorrect group start detection or main color influencing wrong rendering priority.
 * What worked: Label removal, mode detection (w>7), run extraction (skipping 8s, min length 2), padding logic, duplication of rows for height, main color computation, special h=2 rendering (though not triggered here).
 * What didn't: In tall mode, process_band likely processes groups out of order or mishandles full-width solids vs. banded; render_layer reverses runs but may not align top/bottom correctly for taller groups; no handling for why full 3s appear early (perhaps misgrouped as left band).
 * Helpful: extract_runs_from_row and find_pattern_groups work well for wide mode; get_max_vertical_run useful for padding.
 * Unhelpful/broken: render_group_hgt assumes fixed h_layer=2 for layers but may not scale; the special_pos logic in h=2 is overly complex and fails if multiple mixes without clear non-main diff (leads to generic padding that scrambles order); overall program() concatenation left+right works for simple but not when bands have asymmetric groups (e.g., one band full-width, other banded).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it has 18 rows (uneven, but should be paired), irregular widths (all 6 elems, ok), but mixes incompatible colors in single rows like [8,3,3,7,7,8] (3s and 7s adjacent, impossible if bands are separate) and [9,7,7,7,7,7]/[7,7,7,7,7,7] (9 mixed into 7s full-width?), suggesting band processing bleeds left/right or wrong column selection.
 * Duplicated pairs are inconsistent (e.g., [8,8,5,5,8,8] twice ok, but [8,3,3,3,3,8] once then varied); ends with repeated [8,8,4,4,8,8] pair, implying duplicate group detection.
 * Missing expected structure: No clear left/right separation (e.g., [8,3,3,7,7,8] mashes left 3s with right 7s); full-width like [9,7,...] shouldn't mix; likely fails on test's complex vertical mixes or taller groups, producing garbage where runs aren't properly extracted/reversed/padded.
 * Does not make sense overall—puzzle rules imply clean banded or run-based blocks without intra-row color clashes unless special h=2 mix, but here it's rampant; need to verify content_cols [1,2,4,5] assumption holds for test grid (unknown without input grid, but output suggests col indexing error post-removal).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where 8 represents empty space and other numbers represent filled cells or bars. The goal is to parse the grid (removing a label column indicated by 0 in the header row), detect if the content is "wide" (horizontal run extraction and rendering) or "tall" (vertical band-based sequence extraction and rendering), extract runs or sequences of identical non-8 values (skipping 8s), and output normalized, centered representations as new rows of bars or sequences padded with 8s to a maximum length/height, repeated for group heights, while preserving or reordering based on implicit rules like direction (left/right label position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid has a header row with a 0 marking the label column position; this column is removed entirely, and the header row is skipped, leaving only content rows for processing.
 * Direction reversal: If the label column is on the right half (label_col > (width-1)/2), reverse processing order (e.g., swap left/right bands, reverse run extraction) to match visual orientation.
 * For "wide" grids (width after removal >7): Group identical consecutive rows (skipping all-8 rows), extract horizontal runs of identical non-8 values (min length 2), render each run as a centered bar of that value padded with 8s to the max run length across all groups, and repeat the bar for the group's height; process groups in top-to-bottom order without sorting.
 * For "tall" grids (width after removal <=7): Assume a structure with content in specific columns (e.g., [1,2] left band, [4,5] right band, possibly ignoring 0,3,6 as spacers/labels); extract vertical sequences per band group (consecutive rows with activity in the band), render left and right column sequences separately as padded rows (to max vertical run height), appending right then left (or swapped if reversed) for each group in top-to-bottom order; all-8 rows are skipped in grouping.
 * Runs/sequences ignore 8s (treat as gaps, not part of runs); only include runs of length >=2 for wide mode.
 * Padding is always centered: (max_len - actual_len) // 2 on left, remainder on right; full-width bars (no padding needed) are output as-is without extra 8s.
 * Output is a flat list of rows, each a list of ints matching the computed width (6 for padded bars in examples, but varies by max run/height).
 * Subtle ordering: Groups are processed in appearance order, but mismatches in training 4 suggest possible need for sorting by label values, band position, or visual prominence (e.g., full-width bars may need repositioning); reversal affects band order but not group internal order.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid after removal returns []; all-8 groups are skipped; min run length 2 avoids single cells; vertical max run defaults to 1 if no runs.
 * Potential bugs: In tall mode, assuming fixed band columns [1,2]/[4,5] may not generalize if grid width varies (e.g., test has irregular outputs suggesting column misalignment); skipping header via [1:] assumes it's always row 0.
 * No rotation or transposition mentioned, but reversal implies handling mirrored inputs.

    return max_r if max_r > 0 else 1
```
(Computes the maximum vertical run length of identical non-8 values across specified columns, skipping 8s; defaults to 1 if none.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 1-3: Correct, indicating solid handling of basic wide/tall detection, label removal, group extraction, run/sequence rendering, padding, repetition for heights, and direction reversal for simple cases.
 * Training example 4: Incorrect—generated output has wrong order of bars (starts with full-width 3s, then padded 7s, padded 3s, padded 4s, padded 3s, full 6s, padded 9s), while expected starts with padded 4s, padded 3s, padded 7s, full 3s, padded 9s, full 6s, padded 3s; some bars like full 3s are correctly unpadded, but overall sequence mismatches suggest failure to sort groups by label value, band position, or another implicit rule (e.g., visual top-to-bottom after reordering); the two full 3s and padded 3s are present but repositioned incorrectly.
 * The process_tall function appends right-seq then left-seq per group, which works for train 1-3 but may not handle interleaved or multi-group band ordering in train 4.
 * No explicit sorting in find_groups or band processing, which succeeds for sequential groups but fails when order needs adjustment (e.g., by prominence or label).
 * Function get_band_groups is helpful for vertical grouping but assumes fixed band columns; may break if test input has different structure.
 * The [1:] skip after remove_col works for header removal in all trains but could be fragile if header isn't always row 0.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hard-coded content_cols=[1,2,4,5] and bands may not generalize beyond 6-7 width grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—rows have inconsistent lengths (e.g., most are 6 elements like [8,8,4,4,8,8], but some like [3,3,3,3,3,7,3,3] and [3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7] are 8 elements with mixed values (3s and 7s in same row), violating the expected uniform padded bar/sequence format; this suggests a bug in rendering (e.g., incorrect padding calculation, failure to center properly, or column misalignment in tall mode leading to concatenated or unfiltered sequences).
 * Missing proper centering/padding in mixed rows (e.g., no 8s around the 3s/7s, and values not isolated as separate bars/sequences).
 * Order seems partially sequential (e.g., 4s, 3s, 6s, 9s appear), but corrupted by mixing (e.g., [8,6,6,3,3,8] blends 6s and 3s) and extras like [8,7,9,7,7,8]/[8,7,7,9,7,8] which may be failed band extractions; full 6s are correct, but overall it doesn't match a clean normalized output.
 * Likely fails due to assuming wrong columns for bands in test input (e.g., if width !=6 after removal, [1,2,4,5] indices may grab spacers or misalign); reversal or group skipping may also be mishandled, leading to non-8 values leaking into pads.
 * To handle test case, need dynamic band detection (e.g., based on non-8 activity) instead of hard-coded columns, and stricter run extraction to avoid mixing values in a single row.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 14:03:36] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where input grids (with numbers 0-9 and 8 as empty space) are processed to extract and reformat runs of identical non-8 values into standardized output bars or sequences, adapting behavior based on grid width (wide mode for horizontal runs, tall mode for vertical runs in specific columns) and label positioning. The goal is to produce a new grid that visually represents compressed or normalized versions of patterned elements, ignoring empty rows/columns and padding to uniform lengths.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids include a label row (first row) with a 0 marking the label column position; this determines if the content needs reversing (if label_col > midpoint).
 * 8 represents empty/blank space and is skipped in run detection; runs are only of non-8 values, and only runs of length >=2 are extracted in wide mode.
 * Wide mode (w > 7) processes horizontal runs across full rows, grouping identical consecutive rows, extracting runs per group, and padding each run to the global max run length with 8s on both sides (centered).
 * Tall mode (w <=7) focuses on specific columns (1,2 for left band; 4,5 for right band), extracting vertical runs only where both band columns are non-8, processing left and right bands separately, and creating alternating rows for each band's sequences padded to max vertical run length.
 * Empty groups or all-8 rows/columns are skipped entirely.
 * Output stacks results vertically, with wide mode repeating bars for group height, and tall mode alternating left/right band rows.
 * Subtle: In tall mode, bands are processed independently but concatenated; vertical runs stop at 8s but only trigger processing if both band columns are non-8 simultaneously.
 * Reversing affects the entire content grid, potentially flipping run directions.
 * Max run lengths are computed excluding 8s, and padding is asymmetric if needed (left-biased floor division).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no runs (all 8s) returns empty; uneven run lengths require padding; label column removal shifts content.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_max_h_run(grid):
    # Computes max horizontal run length of non-8 values across all rows, skipping 8s.
    max_r = 0
    for row in grid:
        j = 0
        n = len(row)
        while j < n:
            if row[j] == 8:

            while j < n and row[j] == c:
                j += 1
            max_r = max(max_r, j - start)
    return max_r
```

    # Computes max vertical run length in specified columns, skipping 8s per column.
    max_r = 0
    h = len(grid)

        if col >= len(grid[0]):

                i += 1
            max_r = max(max_r, i - start)
    return max_r
```

```python
def process_band(grid, band_l_col, band_r_col, max_w):
    # Processes vertical sequences in a band (pair of columns), creating padded rows for left and right sequences alternately when both cols non-8.

        group_h = i - start
        # Right col sequence

        p_r_r = max_w - l_r - p_l_r
        row_r = [8] * p_l_r + seq_r + [8] * p_r_r

        sub_out.append(row_l)
    return sub_out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled all 4 training examples, demonstrating understanding of mode switching (wide vs tall), run extraction, padding, and band processing.
 * Worked: Label column detection and content slicing; reversing logic; skipping all-8 rows; grouping identical rows in wide mode; vertical band alternation in tall mode.
 * Did not work: Potential issues in tall mode band triggering (requires both cols non-8 simultaneously, which might miss staggered patterns); wide mode only extracts runs >=2, possibly omitting singletons if needed (though training passed); no explicit handling for non-standard column indices beyond hardcoded 1,2,4,5.
 * The program assumes fixed content columns in tall mode, which worked for training but may not generalize if test has different layouts.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one builds a solid base with run-max functions essential for padding uniformity.
 * Function `get_max_h_run` and `get_max_v_run` are helpful and correct for computing normalization lengths.
 * Function `process_band` is essential for tall mode but subtly broken in that it appends left row after right, potentially ordering sequences incorrectly if puzzle expects simultaneous or different alternation.
 * Overall, core run extraction and padding logic is helpful; no unhelpful functions, but hardcoded columns (1,2,4,5) may not be flexible.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of short padded bars like repeated [8,8,4,4,8,8], mixed with longer rows like [3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7] and [3,3,3,3,3,7,3,3], and vertical-style sequences like [8,7,7,9,7,8].
 * It appears to mix wide and tall mode outputs, with some rows padded to length 6 and others to 8, suggesting inconsistent max_w computation or mode mishandling for the test input (possibly test is tall but processed partially as wide, or vice versa).
 * Does not look fully correct: Rows vary in length (6 vs 8), which breaks grid uniformity (expected rectangular output); sequences like [8,6,6,3,3,8] seem like horizontal runs but include mixed values without clear grouping; [3,3,3,3,3,7,3,3] has an abrupt 7 insertion and trailing 3s, differing from expected clean padded runs (possibly failed to group identical rows or misextracted verticals).
 * Missing vertical stacking consistency—output has 18 rows but irregular patterns, likely not matching expected normalized bars; for example, if test has vertical bands, the alternation might be out of order, leading to interleaved 7s/9s unexpectedly.
 * The output makes partial sense for run padding (e.g., centered 4s and 9s) but fails on uniformity and possibly band synchronization, indicating the hardcoded columns or band-trigger logic doesn't handle test's layout (e.g., if bands are offset or include 8s differently).

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 14:03:37] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels where 1-9 are colors and 8 is background/empty space) to extract and re-render structured "blocks" or "objects" (such as shapes, bars, or symbols) into a new output grid. The goal appears to be isolating meaningful visual elements from the input, handling their vertical and horizontal structure, padding them appropriately with 8s, and arranging or duplicating them to form a coherent output image, often with fixed-width rows (e.g., 6 elements) that may include multiple elements side-by-side or varying heights.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input grids likely contain borders, separators (e.g., all-8 rows or columns), or framing elements (possibly involving 0s or edges) that need to be trimmed or ignored to extract the core drawing—e.g., removing left/right columns based on edge values like 0 or non-8 starts.
 * Objects/blocks are not just simple horizontal runs; they can span multiple rows with varying heights (e.g., single rows for irregular shapes, double rows for thick lines/bars), so vertical structure must be preserved rather than flattening everything into duplicated pairs.
 * Horizontal runs of the same non-8 color should be extracted, but only as part of larger multi-row objects—ignoring isolated 8s is good, but skipping all-8 rows without extracting adjacent content can miss context.
 * Rendering involves centering/padding blocks to a maximum width (e.g., 6 in examples) with 8s on both sides, but multiple blocks may need to be composed side-by-side in the same row(s) rather than rendered separately.
 * Duplication of rows only applies to certain elements (e.g., horizontal bars like [8,8,4,4,8,8] are duplicated, but irregular shapes like [1,2,6,6,6,6] or [7,4,7,7,7,7] appear as single rows), suggesting detection of "solid" vs. "detailed" blocks.
 * Subtle elements: Handle cases where rows are identical (e.g., thick lines) by consuming both without redundant output; avoid over-duplicating everything, as this fragments the image; account for asymmetric padding or non-centered placement in some cases; the output may represent a "key" or arranged symbols, so order and adjacency matter (e.g., placing shapes next to each other without extra 8 separators unless specified).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided): The approach correctly identifies some simple, uniform blocks in train2/3 (likely single or paired identical rows), but fails on complex multi-row or side-by-side compositions in train1/4; test input shows extreme fragmentation, indicating over-reliance on horizontal runs without vertical grouping.
 * General considerations: Max width should be consistent across the output (e.g., 6), not per-block; empty or all-8 sections should be fully omitted, not rendered; potential for 0s as special (e.g., borders to trim), though not seen in outputs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_runs(row: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts consecutive runs of non-8 colors, ignoring 8s—useful for compressing uniform segments within a row,
    # but should be applied per object, not globally, to avoid breaking multi-row structures.
    runs = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != 8:
            color = row[i]
            start = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            run = [color] * (i - start)
            runs.append(run)
        else:
            i += 1
    return runs
```

```python
def get_max_w(blocks: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Computes max length of block rows—helpful for consistent padding, but blocks need to be properly defined first.
    if not blocks:
        return 0
    return max(len(b) for b in blocks)
```

```python
def pad_line(line: List[int], max_w: int) -> List[int]:
    # Centers a line/block with 8s—useful for background filling, but apply after composing full rows, not to tiny runs.
    w = len(line)
    if w == max_w:
        return line
    pad_left = (max_w - w) // 2
    pad_right = max_w - w - pad_left
    return [8] * pad_left + line + [8] * pad_right
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future attempts):**
- `get_drawing`: Attempts to trim edges based on first row's start (0 vs. non-0), but logic is flawed/incomplete—e.g., it removes entire columns from subsequent rows without checking consistency, leading to distorted grids; doesn't handle top/bottom borders or verify if 0s are actually present; not robust for varied inputs.
- `get_blocks`: Breaks on multi-row complexity—e.g., only handles pairs of identical rows by extracting runs once and skipping, but treats single rows the same way, resulting in flat lists of tiny runs instead of preserved 2D objects; skips all-8 rows correctly but doesn't group non-identical adjacent rows into taller blocks; outputs a flat list unsuitable for vertical rendering.
- `render_blocks`: Forces every block into duplicated pairs, which works for simple bars (train2/3) but over-duplicates irregular shapes (e.g., turns a single detailed row into two identical ones); renders each run separately instead of composing into full-width rows with multiple elements side-by-side.
- Overall `program`: Chains the above, so inherits all flaws—produces narrow, fragmented outputs instead of full images.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled simple cases (train2/3 passed), likely uniform bars or single objects, by extracting runs and duplicating for thickness.
 * Missed preserving vertical structure in complex inputs (train1/4 incorrect)—e.g., in train1, generated narrow 2-wide duplicated runs like [4,4]/[9,9] scattered, but expected full 6-wide rows with side-by-side elements (e.g., [8,8,4,4,8,8] duplicated, then non-duplicated [1,2,6,6,6,6] and [7,4,7,7,7,7]/[4,7,7,7,7,7] showing shape details).
 * In train4, generated reordered/fragmented blocks like duplicated [3,3,3,3,3,3] early and [8,4,4,4,4,8] mid, but expected specific order with [3,3,3,3,3,3] duplicated later, [8,3,3,3,3,8] at end, and no fragmentation—difference in block grouping and placement (unknown why order shifted, possibly from flawed row-skipping).
 * extract_runs is partially helpful for horizontal compression but insufficient alone, as it ignores vertical context—essential to combine with 2D object detection.
 * get_blocks over-skips or misgroups rows (e.g., treats non-identical rows as separate tiny blocks), leading to loss of adjacency (e.g., train1's [8,6,6,3,3,8]/[8,3,3,3,3,8] became scattered [6,8]/[3,8] pairs).
 * Train1 mismatches overall composition: generated ~40 narrow lines vs. expected 12 full rows; shapes like [1,2,6,6,6,6] lost (unknown how input represented it, but program didn't capture mixed colors in rows).
 * Train4 has position errors: e.g., [8,8,7,7,8,8] appears early in generated but mid in expected; [8,3,3,3,3,8] missing entirely in generated (possibly skipped as non-paired).
 * Function `get_drawing` is broken for non-edge cases—may distort grids unnecessarily (e.g., if no 0s, removes wrong columns).
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of runs/padding but fails core 2D extraction.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is highly fragmented into ~40 narrow (mostly 2-wide) duplicated rows like [3,3]x2, [4,4]x2, [6,8]x2, [7,8]x2, [9,9]x6 (over-duplicated at end), with scattered singles like [5,5]x2, resembling disassembled pixels rather than a coherent image.
 * It lacks full-width composition (e.g., no 6-wide rows with multiple elements side-by-side or proper padding); order seems arbitrary/jumbled (e.g., [3,3] repeats early, [9,9] bloated at end), missing expected structure like arranged symbols or scenes.
 * Compared to train examples, it over-applies duplication (e.g., six [9,9] rows vs. expected pairs) and ignores vertical grouping (e.g., potential taller [6,6] stacks reduced to pairs); does not make sense as a visual puzzle output—looks like raw run extraction without reassembly, so likely incorrect for test input (unknown exact expected, but pattern suggests full rows with shapes like bars, blobs, or keys).
 * To handle test: Need better object detection (e.g., flood-fill or bounding boxes for connected non-8 regions) and row-level composition to avoid this; account for potential long runs or multi-color rows in test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids represent labeled patterns of colored blocks (numbers 1-9, with 8 as empty space), and the goal is to extract, process, and re-render these patterns into a simplified output grid by removing labels, handling horizontal or vertical runs, and rendering bands or groups with padding and main colors, distinguishing between "wide" (horizontal-focused) and "tall" (vertical band-focused) modes based on grid width after label removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids start with a label column (containing 0 for the relevant pattern) that must be identified and removed before processing; ignoring this leads to polluted outputs.
 * Mode selection is critical: if width >7 after removal, use "wide mode" to group repeated rows, extract horizontal runs of length >=2 (skipping 8s), find max run length for padding, and render centered blocks vertically stacked by group height; if <=7, use "tall mode" with fixed content columns [1,2,4,5] (implying columns 0 and 3,6+ are spacers or labels), process left band [1,2] and right band [4,5] separately.
 * In tall mode, groups are vertical stretches of non-8 content in bands; compute main color as most frequent non-8 in the group; for height=2 groups, render specially (e.g., full main color top row, mixed or padded bottom); for taller groups, render top and bottom layers based on band runs, reversing run order for rendering, and pad to max vertical run width.
 * Padding is always centered with 8s: left pad = (max_size - content) // 2, right = remainder; runs of 8s are skipped, not rendered.
 * Output rows come in pairs (duplicated for height representation?); full-width solid rows (no 8s) are rendered as-is, duplicated.
 * Subtle: In band rendering, extract runs horizontally within band columns, reverse them for output order; special case for single mixed position in h=2 where non-main differing colors get prioritized in a 2-cell block; empty or all-8 groups are skipped.
 * Vertical runs for max_w ignore 8s and compute max consecutive non-8 in content columns; horizontal runs in wide mode skip 8s but count consecutive same non-8.
 * Easy to miss: Order of output matters—left band before right in tall mode, but within bands, groups processed top-to-bottom; in training 4, this led to reordered blocks (e.g., full 3s before 4s/7s/3s).
 * All-8 rows are skipped in grouping; group height is consecutive identical non-all-8 rows.
 * Outputs are always even height (paired rows), padded to consistent width.

(Note: Functions like build_wide_output, process_band, render_group_h2, render_group_hgt, and render_layer from the attempt are helpful for rendering but have bugs in ordering/special cases; use as base but fix. No types defined, but Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int,int]]] for groups is useful.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 1-3: CORRECT, indicating solid handling of wide mode (horizontal runs, grouping, centered padding) and basic tall mode band separation for simpler cases.
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT; generated output reorders blocks (starts with full-width 3s, then 7s pair, 3s pair, 4s pair, another 3s pair, 6s full, 9s pair; ends with misplaced 3s), while expected has 4s pair first, then 3s/7s/full 3s/9s/full 6s/3s—suggests failure in top-to-bottom group ordering within bands or left/right concatenation, possibly due to incorrect group start detection or main color influencing wrong rendering priority.
 * What worked: Label removal, mode detection (w>7), run extraction (skipping 8s, min length 2), padding logic, duplication of rows for height, main color computation, special h=2 rendering (though not triggered here).
 * What didn't: In tall mode, process_band likely processes groups out of order or mishandles full-width solids vs. banded; render_layer reverses runs but may not align top/bottom correctly for taller groups; no handling for why full 3s appear early (perhaps misgrouped as left band).
 * Helpful: extract_runs_from_row and find_pattern_groups work well for wide mode; get_max_vertical_run useful for padding.
 * Unhelpful/broken: render_group_hgt assumes fixed h_layer=2 for layers but may not scale; the special_pos logic in h=2 is overly complex and fails if multiple mixes without clear non-main diff (leads to generic padding that scrambles order); overall program() concatenation left+right works for simple but not when bands have asymmetric groups (e.g., one band full-width, other banded).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it has 18 rows (uneven, but should be paired), irregular widths (all 6 elems, ok), but mixes incompatible colors in single rows like [8,3,3,7,7,8] (3s and 7s adjacent, impossible if bands are separate) and [9,7,7,7,7,7]/[7,7,7,7,7,7] (9 mixed into 7s full-width?), suggesting band processing bleeds left/right or wrong column selection.
 * Duplicated pairs are inconsistent (e.g., [8,8,5,5,8,8] twice ok, but [8,3,3,3,3,8] once then varied); ends with repeated [8,8,4,4,8,8] pair, implying duplicate group detection.
 * Missing expected structure: No clear left/right separation (e.g., [8,3,3,7,7,8] mashes left 3s with right 7s); full-width like [9,7,...] shouldn't mix; likely fails on test's complex vertical mixes or taller groups, producing garbage where runs aren't properly extracted/reversed/padded.
 * Does not make sense overall—puzzle rules imply clean banded or run-based blocks without intra-row color clashes unless special h=2 mix, but here it's rampant; need to verify content_cols [1,2,4,5] assumption holds for test grid (unknown without input grid, but output suggests col indexing error post-removal).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where 8 represents empty space and other numbers represent filled cells or bars. The goal is to parse the grid (removing a label column indicated by 0 in the header row), detect if the content is "wide" (horizontal run extraction and rendering) or "tall" (vertical band-based sequence extraction and rendering), extract runs or sequences of identical non-8 values (skipping 8s), and output normalized, centered representations as new rows of bars or sequences padded with 8s to a maximum length/height, repeated for group heights, while preserving or reordering based on implicit rules like direction (left/right label position).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid has a header row with a 0 marking the label column position; this column is removed entirely, and the header row is skipped, leaving only content rows for processing.
 * Direction reversal: If the label column is on the right half (label_col > (width-1)/2), reverse processing order (e.g., swap left/right bands, reverse run extraction) to match visual orientation.
 * For "wide" grids (width after removal >7): Group identical consecutive rows (skipping all-8 rows), extract horizontal runs of identical non-8 values (min length 2), render each run as a centered bar of that value padded with 8s to the max run length across all groups, and repeat the bar for the group's height; process groups in top-to-bottom order without sorting.
 * For "tall" grids (width after removal <=7): Assume a structure with content in specific columns (e.g., [1,2] left band, [4,5] right band, possibly ignoring 0,3,6 as spacers/labels); extract vertical sequences per band group (consecutive rows with activity in the band), render left and right column sequences separately as padded rows (to max vertical run height), appending right then left (or swapped if reversed) for each group in top-to-bottom order; all-8 rows are skipped in grouping.
 * Runs/sequences ignore 8s (treat as gaps, not part of runs); only include runs of length >=2 for wide mode.
 * Padding is always centered: (max_len - actual_len) // 2 on left, remainder on right; full-width bars (no padding needed) are output as-is without extra 8s.
 * Output is a flat list of rows, each a list of ints matching the computed width (6 for padded bars in examples, but varies by max run/height).
 * Subtle ordering: Groups are processed in appearance order, but mismatches in training 4 suggest possible need for sorting by label values, band position, or visual prominence (e.g., full-width bars may need repositioning); reversal affects band order but not group internal order.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid after removal returns []; all-8 groups are skipped; min run length 2 avoids single cells; vertical max run defaults to 1 if no runs.
 * Potential bugs: In tall mode, assuming fixed band columns [1,2]/[4,5] may not generalize if grid width varies (e.g., test has irregular outputs suggesting column misalignment); skipping header via [1:] assumes it's always row 0.
 * No rotation or transposition mentioned, but reversal implies handling mirrored inputs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

            runs.append((c, l))
    if reverse_dir:
        runs = runs[::-1]
    return runs
```
(Extracts consecutive non-8 runs from a row as (value, length) tuples, skipping 8s as gaps, with optional reversal and min length filter; reverses results if needed to maintain original order post-reversal.)

            i += 1
        groups.append((i - start, row))
    return groups
```
(Groups consecutive identical non-all-8 rows, returning (height, row_sample) for each group; skips all-8 rows.)

```python
def render_bar(c: int, length: int, max_w: int) -> List[int]:
    pad_l = (max_w - length) // 2
    pad_r = max_w - length - pad_l
    return [8] * pad_l + [c] * length + [8] * pad_r
```
(Centers a bar of value c and given length in a row of max_w, padding with 8s.)

```python
def render_seq(seq: List[int], max_w: int) -> List[int]:
    ln = len(seq)
    if ln == max_w:
        return seq[:]
    pad_l = (max_w - ln) // 2
    pad_r = max_w - ln - pad_l
    return [8] * pad_l + seq + [8] * pad_r
```
(Pads a sequence vertically to max height with centered 8s, handling full-length cases without padding.)

```python
def get_max_vertical_run(grid: List[List[int]], content_cols: List[int]) -> int:
    max_r = 0
    h = len(grid)
    for col in content_cols:

            max_r = max(max_r, i - start)
    return max_r if max_r > 0 else 1
```
(Computes the maximum vertical run length of identical non-8 values across specified columns, skipping 8s; defaults to 1 if none.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 1-3: Correct, indicating solid handling of basic wide/tall detection, label removal, group extraction, run/sequence rendering, padding, repetition for heights, and direction reversal for simple cases.
 * Training example 4: Incorrect—generated output has wrong order of bars (starts with full-width 3s, then padded 7s, padded 3s, padded 4s, padded 3s, full 6s, padded 9s), while expected starts with padded 4s, padded 3s, padded 7s, full 3s, padded 9s, full 6s, padded 3s; some bars like full 3s are correctly unpadded, but overall sequence mismatches suggest failure to sort groups by label value, band position, or another implicit rule (e.g., visual top-to-bottom after reordering); the two full 3s and padded 3s are present but repositioned incorrectly.
 * The process_tall function appends right-seq then left-seq per group, which works for train 1-3 but may not handle interleaved or multi-group band ordering in train 4.
 * No explicit sorting in find_groups or band processing, which succeeds for sequential groups but fails when order needs adjustment (e.g., by prominence or label).
 * Function get_band_groups is helpful for vertical grouping but assumes fixed band columns; may break if test input has different structure.
 * The [1:] skip after remove_col works for header removal in all trains but could be fragile if header isn't always row 0.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hard-coded content_cols=[1,2,4,5] and bands may not generalize beyond 6-7 width grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—rows have inconsistent lengths (e.g., most are 6 elements like [8,8,4,4,8,8], but some like [3,3,3,3,3,7,3,3] and [3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7] are 8 elements with mixed values (3s and 7s in same row), violating the expected uniform padded bar/sequence format; this suggests a bug in rendering (e.g., incorrect padding calculation, failure to center properly, or column misalignment in tall mode leading to concatenated or unfiltered sequences).
 * Missing proper centering/padding in mixed rows (e.g., no 8s around the 3s/7s, and values not isolated as separate bars/sequences).
 * Order seems partially sequential (e.g., 4s, 3s, 6s, 9s appear), but corrupted by mixing (e.g., [8,6,6,3,3,8] blends 6s and 3s) and extras like [8,7,9,7,7,8]/[8,7,7,9,7,8] which may be failed band extractions; full 6s are correct, but overall it doesn't match a clean normalized output.
 * Likely fails due to assuming wrong columns for bands in test input (e.g., if width !=6 after removal, [1,2,4,5] indices may grab spacers or misalign); reversal or group skipping may also be mishandled, leading to non-8 values leaking into pads.
 * To handle test case, need dynamic band detection (e.g., based on non-8 activity) instead of hard-coded columns, and stricter run extraction to avoid mixing values in a single row.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where input grids (with numbers 0-9 and 8 as empty space) are processed to extract and reformat runs of identical non-8 values into standardized output bars or sequences, adapting behavior based on grid width (wide mode for horizontal runs, tall mode for vertical runs in specific columns) and label positioning. The goal is to produce a new grid that visually represents compressed or normalized versions of patterned elements, ignoring empty rows/columns and padding to uniform lengths.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids include a label row (first row) with a 0 marking the label column position; this determines if the content needs reversing (if label_col > midpoint).
 * 8 represents empty/blank space and is skipped in run detection; runs are only of non-8 values, and only runs of length >=2 are extracted in wide mode.
 * Wide mode (w > 7) processes horizontal runs across full rows, grouping identical consecutive rows, extracting runs per group, and padding each run to the global max run length with 8s on both sides (centered).
 * Tall mode (w <=7) focuses on specific columns (1,2 for left band; 4,5 for right band), extracting vertical runs only where both band columns are non-8, processing left and right bands separately, and creating alternating rows for each band's sequences padded to max vertical run length.
 * Empty groups or all-8 rows/columns are skipped entirely.
 * Output stacks results vertically, with wide mode repeating bars for group height, and tall mode alternating left/right band rows.
 * Subtle: In tall mode, bands are processed independently but concatenated; vertical runs stop at 8s but only trigger processing if both band columns are non-8 simultaneously.
 * Reversing affects the entire content grid, potentially flipping run directions.
 * Max run lengths are computed excluding 8s, and padding is asymmetric if needed (left-biased floor division).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no runs (all 8s) returns empty; uneven run lengths require padding; label column removal shifts content.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    return sub_out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled all 4 training examples, demonstrating understanding of mode switching (wide vs tall), run extraction, padding, and band processing.
 * Worked: Label column detection and content slicing; reversing logic; skipping all-8 rows; grouping identical rows in wide mode; vertical band alternation in tall mode.
 * Did not work: Potential issues in tall mode band triggering (requires both cols non-8 simultaneously, which might miss staggered patterns); wide mode only extracts runs >=2, possibly omitting singletons if needed (though training passed); no explicit handling for non-standard column indices beyond hardcoded 1,2,4,5.
 * The program assumes fixed content columns in tall mode, which worked for training but may not generalize if test has different layouts.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one builds a solid base with run-max functions essential for padding uniformity.
 * Function `get_max_h_run` and `get_max_v_run` are helpful and correct for computing normalization lengths.
 * Function `process_band` is essential for tall mode but subtly broken in that it appends left row after right, potentially ordering sequences incorrectly if puzzle expects simultaneous or different alternation.
 * Overall, core run extraction and padding logic is helpful; no unhelpful functions, but hardcoded columns (1,2,4,5) may not be flexible.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of short padded bars like repeated [8,8,4,4,8,8], mixed with longer rows like [3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7] and [3,3,3,3,3,7,3,3], and vertical-style sequences like [8,7,7,9,7,8].
 * It appears to mix wide and tall mode outputs, with some rows padded to length 6 and others to 8, suggesting inconsistent max_w computation or mode mishandling for the test input (possibly test is tall but processed partially as wide, or vice versa).
 * Does not look fully correct: Rows vary in length (6 vs 8), which breaks grid uniformity (expected rectangular output); sequences like [8,6,6,3,3,8] seem like horizontal runs but include mixed values without clear grouping; [3,3,3,3,3,7,3,3] has an abrupt 7 insertion and trailing 3s, differing from expected clean padded runs (possibly failed to group identical rows or misextracted verticals).
 * Missing vertical stacking consistency—output has 18 rows but irregular patterns, likely not matching expected normalized bars; for example, if test has vertical bands, the alternation might be out of order, leading to interleaved 7s/9s unexpectedly.
 * The output makes partial sense for run padding (e.g., centered 4s and 9s) but fails on uniformity and possibly band synchronization, indicating the hardcoded columns or band-trigger logic doesn't handle test's layout (e.g., if bands are offset or include 8s differently).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 14:09:46] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a grid of integers (likely representing colored cells or patterns, with 8 as blank/empty) that includes a header row for identifying a label column, followed by content rows to extract and re-render as simplified bar-like structures or vertical sequences, depending on grid width after preprocessing. The goal is to normalize and output a new grid that captures horizontal runs or vertical bands while handling symmetries, paddings, and mode-specific rendering (wide vs. tall).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Header row uses 0 to mark the label column position; this column must be identified and removed from content rows, but preserved in logic for reversal decisions.
 * Reversal is needed if the label column is on the right half (beyond center) to standardize left-to-right orientation, using (orig_w - 1) / 2 as the midpoint threshold.
 * Blanks (8s) are skipped or used for padding; they don't count in runs or sequences but are essential for centering bars or sequences to a max width.
 * Wide mode (width >7) focuses on horizontal runs of identical non-8 values (min length 2), grouping identical rows vertically, then rendering each run as a centered horizontal bar of the run's color/value, repeated for group height, with max run length determining bar width.
 * Tall mode (width <=7) treats specific column pairs (e.g., 1-2 and 4-5, 0-indexed after removal/reversal) as left/right bands, extracting vertical sequences of non-blank values, padding/centering them to width 6, and alternating left/right rendered rows for each group of matching rows.
 * Subtleties: Runs ignore isolated 8s but treat them as separators; vertical grouping skips all-8 rows but processes blocks of identical non-all-8 rows; padding is symmetric (left-biased if odd); max_w in wide mode is the longest run, but in tall it's fixed at 6; varying input widths require dynamic handling post-removal.
 * Easy-to-miss: After reversal, column indices for tall mode (e.g., 1,2,4,5) assume post-processed grid; wide mode collapses vertical duplicates into repeated bars; no diagonal or complex shape extraction—just linear runs/bands.
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure consistent output row lengths (e.g., all to max_w); handle uneven group heights by repeating bars/sequences exactly; skip empty/all-8 inputs gracefully; potential for label column affecting post-removal width calculation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

        if length >= min_len:

    return runs

def render_bar(c: int, length: int, max_w: int) -> List[int]:
    """Renders a centered bar of value c and given length, padded with 8s to max_w."""
    if length == max_w:

    return [8] * pad_l + seq + [8] * pad_r
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled label detection, removal, and reversal, as evidenced by all 4 training examples passing.
 * Wide mode logic for horizontal runs and bar rendering worked for trainings, including max run calculation, run extraction (skipping 8s and min_len=2), and centered padding.
 * Tall mode band processing (columns 1-2 and 4-5, alternating left/right pads to width 6) succeeded in trainings, including vertical grouping and skipping all-8 rows.
 * No prior misses noted since trainings passed, but potential oversight in assuming fixed column indices post-reversal without validation; get_grid_width assumes uniform row lengths.
 * Functions like process_wide_mode and process_tall_mode are essential for mode-specific output; they integrate grouping, extraction, and rendering well.
 * No unhelpful functions identified—all provided (e.g., is_wide_mode, process_band) directly support core logic and are relevant; none appear broken based on training success.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 18 rows, mostly of length 6 (padded with 8s), but rows 11-12 are length 8 ([3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7] and [3,3,3,3,3,7,3,3]), indicating inconsistent row widths, which does not make sense for a normalized output grid and suggests a bug in padding or max_w handling (e.g., wide mode misapplied or unhandled longer runs).
 * Early rows like repeated [8,8,4,4,8,8] and [8,6,6,3,3,8] resemble centered bars of 4s (length 2) and mixed runs (6s len2 + 3s len2), which could be correct for wide mode if max_w=6, but later [8,7,7,9,7,8] and [8,7,9,7,7,8] show asymmetric 7s and 9s that don't align as clean runs, possibly mishandling vertical groups or band extraction.
 * Rows like [6,6,6,6,6,6] (full bar) and [8,8,9,9,8,8] look plausible as full/partial bars, but the shift to length-8 rows with mixed 3s and 7s (not centered or run-based) suggests failure to standardize to a single max_w, perhaps due to incorrect mode detection or reversal affecting column bands.
 * Overall, the test output does not look fully correct: while some bar-like structures match expected rendering (e.g., centered short runs), the varying lengths and asymmetric placements (e.g., 7s not forming clean runs) differ from expected uniform, centered outputs; it's unclear if this stems from test input specifics (e.g., wider grid triggering wrong mode) but highlights a need for enforced uniform widths and better run validation.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 14:09:58] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train examples, the following interactions and connections between elements are obvious and consistent across **all** train inputs/outputs. These focus solely on properties (e.g., position, color, pixel count, holes, shape dimensions) and components (e.g., embedded colored blobs, Maroon background, frame) that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in the transformation from input to output. Only patterns holding in every example are included; no assumptions or forced explanations for unresolved aspects (e.g., exact pixel placement within layers or minor shape irregularities). Unknowns are noted where a connection is consistent but its mechanism cannot be explained without solving.

- **Vertical frame position (left vs. right) affects horizontal reading direction of embedded blocks**: In every train input, the side of the vertical frame (Red or Blue column, always 7 pixels high) determines the left-to-right or right-to-left ordering of embedded blocks (non-frame, non-Maroon colored blobs) within each horizontal row (y-level groups, typically height 2). Left frame (trains 1-3) consistently leads to left-to-right ordering; right frame (train 4) consistently leads to right-to-left ordering. This ordering directly effects the top-to-bottom sequence of blocks in the output layers.

- **Vertical position (row/y-level) of embedded blocks affects vertical placement in output**: Across all trains, higher rows (lower y-values) of embedded blocks in the input consistently map to higher positions (lower y-values) in the output, preserving relative top-to-bottom order of rows. This interaction sequences the blocks into stacked horizontal layers in the output, with no reversals across rows.

- **Pixel count per embedded color affects preservation and merging in output**: In every train, the total pixel count for each color of embedded blocks (excluding frame Red/Blue and Maroon) is exactly preserved in the output. Same-color blocks may merge into fewer components if adjacent in the new arrangement (e.g., Pinks in train 1 merge from 10+2=12 to one 12-pixel blob), but total pixels per color remain unchanged. Frame Red/Blue pixels are consistently not preserved (reduced or omitted).

- **Number of holes in input Maroon affects number of colored layers in output**: The hole count in the single input Maroon component (always >0) consistently equals the number of distinct colored (non-Maroon) layers in the output across all trains (e.g., 6 holes → 6 layers in train 1; 4 holes → 4 layers in train 2; 7 holes → 7 layers in train 3; 7 holes → 7 layers in train 4). This suggests holes encode or interact with the count of output layers, but the exact mapping mechanism is unknown.

- **Maximum width of input embedded blocks affects output grid width**: In every train, the widest dimension (x-span) among all input embedded blocks determines the total width of the output grid (e.g., max w=4 → output w=4 in train 2; max w=8 → output w=8 in train 3; max w=6 → output w=6 in train 4). Narrower blocks in output layers are consistently padded with Maroon on sides to fill this width.

- **Input Maroon (with holes) affects output Maroon components (solid, framing)**: The input's single Maroon component (with holes>0, serving as background) is consistently split into multiple output Maroon components (all with holes=0), which fill left/right margins around embedded blocks to frame the layers. Total output Maroon pixels vary (not preserved), but the splitting and placement are always tied to gaps created by the ordered embedded blocks' widths. No enclosed holes remain in output Maroon.

- **Height of embedded blocks (>2) affects shape transformation to height=2 in output**: In trains with embedded blocks exceeding height 2 (only train 1, but consistent where present and non-conflicting with others), the vertical extent interacts with pixel count to transform the shape into a height=2 layer in output, expanding width to accommodate the same pixels (e.g., input h=4 w=2 p=6 → output h=2 w=4 p=6). Blocks already at h=2 (all other trains) remain at h=2 without change. Single-pixel blocks (h=1 w=1) are consistently embedded within output layers, creating missing pixels (indentations) in adjacent blocks' shapes without forming holes.

- **Top horizontal bar (Red/Blue) interacts with frame exclusion**: In all trains, the top horizontal bar (always at y=0, Red or Blue, variable length) is consistently excluded from the output along with the vertical frame, with no preservation of their bulk pixels. Any small embedded parts of those colors (if present) are treated as regular embedded blocks and preserved via the pixel count rule above.

**Notes on unknowns/limitations**:
- Exact side-margin widths for Maroon fillers (e.g., symmetric vs. asymmetric) vary slightly but are consistently tied to input block widths; the balancing mechanism is unknown.
- Single-pixel blocks' exact placement within output layers (e.g., left/center) consistently affects adjacent block shapes but follows no obvious explainable rule without solving.
- No consistent color-to-color interactions (e.g., one color changing another's properties) beyond merging same colors; different colors do not alter each other's pixel counts or holes.
- Shape silhouettes (e.g., exact non-rectangular fills within bbox) are preserved in pixel count but not always in form; transformations for irregular shapes are unknown beyond the height rule.
- No interactions involving unused properties (e.g., bbox y-max not affecting output height consistently; maroon pixel count not preserved). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated frame pixels) show no connections.

[2025-10-02 14:17:34] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train examples, the following interactions and connections between elements are obvious and consistent across **all** train inputs/outputs. These focus solely on properties (e.g., position, color, pixel count, holes, shape dimensions) and components (e.g., embedded colored blobs, Maroon background, frame) that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in the transformation from input to output. Only patterns holding in every example are included; no assumptions or forced explanations for unresolved aspects (e.g., exact pixel placement within layers or minor shape irregularities). Unknowns are noted where a connection is consistent but its mechanism cannot be explained without solving.

- **Vertical frame position (left vs. right) affects horizontal reading direction of embedded blocks**: In every train input, the side of the vertical frame (Red or Blue column, always 7 pixels high) determines the left-to-right or right-to-left ordering of embedded blocks (non-frame, non-Maroon colored blobs) within each horizontal row (y-level groups, typically height 2). Left frame (trains 1-3) consistently leads to left-to-right ordering; right frame (train 4) consistently leads to right-to-left ordering. This ordering directly effects the top-to-bottom sequence of blocks in the output layers.

- **Vertical position (row/y-level) of embedded blocks affects vertical placement in output**: Across all trains, higher rows (lower y-values) of embedded blocks in the input consistently map to higher positions (lower y-values) in the output, preserving relative top-to-bottom order of rows. This interaction sequences the blocks into stacked horizontal layers in the output, with no reversals across rows.

- **Pixel count per embedded color affects preservation and merging in output**: In every train, the total pixel count for each color of embedded blocks (excluding frame Red/Blue and Maroon) is exactly preserved in the output. Same-color blocks may merge into fewer components if adjacent in the new arrangement (e.g., Pinks in train 1 merge from 10+2=12 to one 12-pixel blob), but total pixels per color remain unchanged. Frame Red/Blue pixels are consistently not preserved (reduced or omitted).

- **Number of holes in input Maroon affects number of colored layers in output**: The hole count in the single input Maroon component (always >0) consistently equals the number of distinct colored (non-Maroon) layers in the output across all trains (e.g., 6 holes → 6 layers in train 1; 4 holes → 4 layers in train 2; 7 holes → 7 layers in train 3; 7 holes → 7 layers in train 4). This suggests holes encode or interact with the count of output layers, but the exact mapping mechanism is unknown.

- **Maximum width of input embedded blocks affects output grid width**: In every train, the widest dimension (x-span) among all input embedded blocks determines the total width of the output grid (e.g., max w=4 → output w=4 in train 2; max w=8 → output w=8 in train 3; max w=6 → output w=6 in train 4). Narrower blocks in output layers are consistently padded with Maroon on sides to fill this width.

- **Input Maroon (with holes) affects output Maroon components (solid, framing)**: The input's single Maroon component (with holes>0, serving as background) is consistently split into multiple output Maroon components (all with holes=0), which fill left/right margins around embedded blocks to frame the layers. Total output Maroon pixels vary (not preserved), but the splitting and placement are always tied to gaps created by the ordered embedded blocks' widths. No enclosed holes remain in output Maroon.

- **Height of embedded blocks (>2) affects shape transformation to height=2 in output**: In trains with embedded blocks exceeding height 2 (only train 1, but consistent where present and non-conflicting with others), the vertical extent interacts with pixel count to transform the shape into a height=2 layer in output, expanding width to accommodate the same pixels (e.g., input h=4 w=2 p=6 → output h=2 w=4 p=6). Blocks already at h=2 (all other trains) remain at h=2 without change. Single-pixel blocks (h=1 w=1) are consistently embedded within output layers, creating missing pixels (indentations) in adjacent blocks' shapes without forming holes.

- **Top horizontal bar (Red/Blue) interacts with frame exclusion**: In all trains, the top horizontal bar (always at y=0, Red or Blue, variable length) is consistently excluded from the output along with the vertical frame, with no preservation of their bulk pixels. Any small embedded parts of those colors (if present) are treated as regular embedded blocks and preserved via the pixel count rule above.

**Notes on unknowns/limitations**:
- Exact side-margin widths for Maroon fillers (e.g., symmetric vs. asymmetric) vary slightly but are consistently tied to input block widths; the balancing mechanism is unknown.
- Single-pixel blocks' exact placement within output layers (e.g., left/center) consistently affects adjacent block shapes but follows no obvious explainable rule without solving.
- No consistent color-to-color interactions (e.g., one color changing another's properties) beyond merging same colors; different colors do not alter each other's pixel counts or holes.
- Shape silhouettes (e.g., exact non-rectangular fills within bbox) are preserved in pixel count but not always in form; transformations for irregular shapes are unknown beyond the height rule.
- No interactions involving unused properties (e.g., bbox y-max not affecting output height consistently; maroon pixel count not preserved). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated frame pixels) show no connections.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 14:38:13] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where a framed inner area contains solid (hole-free, rectangular) blocks of identical numbers representing shapes or objects, separated potentially by full columns of 8 (background). The goal is to extract these blocks, read their cells in column-major order to form a 1D sequence, split the sequence roughly in half into "top" and "bottom" parts, pad each half with 8s to a uniform width based on the largest half-size across all blocks, and output paired rows (top then bottom) for each block in left-to-right (or adjusted for frame side) reading order, effectively "unfolding" and reformatting the shapes into a new grid of horizontal strips.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a frame: identify the frame column (left or right) by finding the column with the maximum count of non-background cells (1 or 2, possibly frame markers) in inner rows; assume exactly one such column, remove it to get the inner grid.
 * Background is 8; blocks are connected components (4-directional) of non-8 cells that must be solid rectangles (component size exactly equals bounding box area, i.e., no holes or irregular shapes—jagged or holed components are ignored).
 * Inner grid may have vertical strips of blocks separated by full columns of 8; detect "multiple mode" if strips are separated by exactly width-1 gaps (single 8 column), which triggers per-strip block extraction and sorting; otherwise, treat as single mode with global extraction and sorting.
 * Sorting: In left-frame mode, sort blocks by (min_row, min_col) ascending; in right-frame mode, by (min_row, -min_col) for right-to-left reading within rows. In multiple mode, sort strips by start col (ascending for left-frame, descending for right-frame), then blocks within strips by min_row.
 * For each block, compute perimeter-like p = height * width (area), wl = (p + 1) // 2 (half-size, ceiling for odd); global_w = (max_p + 1) // 2 across all blocks for uniform padding width.
 * Sequence extraction: For each block, read cells column-by-column (outer loop columns, inner loop rows within block bounds) to get 1D seq of length p; split into bottom = seq[:wl], top = seq[wl:wl] (second half, may be shorter for odd p).
 * Padding: Center-pad top and bottom to exactly global_w with 8s (left pad = (global_w - len) // 2, right pad = remainder); append extra 8s if still short (handles odd lengths).
 * Output: For each block in sorted order, append the padded top row, then padded bottom row; result is a flat list of lists (no overall frame or separators).
 * Subtle elements: Assume rectangular solid blocks only—irregular connected components are skipped; column-major reading order is crucial (not row-major); odd-sized blocks split unevenly (bottom gets one more); multiple mode only triggers on width-1 separators (wider gaps are just skipped as full_8); frame detection ignores row 0 (header?); empty or zero-width inner grids return empty output.
 * Easy to miss: Padding must be centered (not left-aligned); global_w based on max half-size, not max width; in multiple mode, blocks don't cross strip boundaries; visited marking in flood-fill prevents revisiting; full_8 columns are entirely 8 across all inner rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return -1
    w = len(g[0])
    if w == 0:
        return -1
    counts = [0] * w
    for j in range(w):
        for i in range(1, h):  # Skip row 0
            if g[i][j] in (1, 2):
                counts[j] += 1
    max_count = max(counts)
    candidates = [j for j, c in enumerate(counts) if c == max_count]
    if len(candidates) != 1:
        return -1
    return candidates[0]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully extracting and reformatting blocks with proper frame detection, strip handling, column-major sequencing, half-splitting, and centered padding, demonstrating core understanding of solid block extraction and output formatting.
 * What worked: Frame column identification, inner grid slicing (removing left/right frame), full_8 column skipping to define strips, multiple-mode detection via width-1 separators, flood-fill for connected components with solid-rectangle validation, sorting logic (adjusted for frame side and mode), sequence splitting (bottom first, then top), uniform global_w computation, and paired row output.
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the generated output appears incorrect or malformed—blocks seem jumbled or non-rectangular (e.g., mixed 3/6 in rows 3-4, uneven padding like 8,6,6,... without full centering, and apparent inclusion of irregular shapes like the long 6-row which may not be solid/rectangular); expected clean paired rows per solid block (e.g., separate 4's, 3's, 6's, 9's, 5's, 7's/9's without mixing), but output has overlaps/cross-contamination in sequences, suggesting flood-fill or strip bounding failed for test case (possibly due to non-solid blocks, wider separators not triggering multiple mode correctly, or column-major reading hitting non-block areas).
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one misses handling cases with irregular/jagged blocks (skips them, but test may require different validation) or non-1/2 frame markers; strip sorting in right-frame multiple mode may reverse incorrectly.
 * Function `get_blocks` is essential and helpful for extracting valid solid components, but could be broken for test if bounds leak or visited misses diagonals (though 4-dir is standard).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided (find_frame_col, get_blocks, main program) are relevant, though the strip detection loop assumes contiguous non-full_8 runs without gaps inside strips (works for training but may fail if test has internal partial 8s).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it generates 18 rows (9 pairs) with inconsistent padding and mixed numbers within supposed block rows (e.g., row 3: [8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8] seems like a 3-block top, but row 4: [8,8,6,6,3,3,8,8] mixes 6 and 3, indicating failed block isolation or incorrect sequencing; later rows like [3,3,3,3,3,7,3,3] have uneven lengths/non-8 padding and apparent non-rectangular inclusion; expected separate clean pairs for distinct blocks like two 4's, horizontal 3's, vertical 6's, 9's, 5's, and mixed 7/9, all padded uniformly to same width without crossover.
 * The output is missing proper separation of blocks (e.g., 6's bleed into 3's) and uniform global_w (widths vary implicitly, some start with fewer leading 8s); it includes what looks like non-solid or multi-block merges, differing from expected by treating adjacent/irregular components as single blocks.
 * To handle test case, account for potential non-full_8 partial barriers inside strips, stricter rectangle validation (e.g., check uniform number value per block), or alternative reading order if column-major fails for vertical-ish shapes.
