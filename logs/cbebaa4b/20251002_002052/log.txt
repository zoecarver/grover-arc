=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 00:20:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 00:34:06] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of connected components (blobs or shapes) from an input grid, where each component consists of cells with the same positive integer value (representing distinct objects or colors), followed by normalizing their relative shapes, sorting them based on their original positions in the input (likely by row centroid to preserve top-to-bottom order), and reassembling them into a new output grid by placing them without overlap in a specific order and position (e.g., packing from the top-left available space, but potentially starting from a baseline row or in sorted order to match expected layouts with leading zero rows).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components must be connected orthogonally (4 directions: up, down, left, right) and only cells with the *exact same value* (>0) should be grouped together—do not merge different values, even if adjacent, as this creates invalid oversized or hybrid shapes.
 * Normalize shapes relative to the minimum row and column in each component to get a "bounding box" origin at (0,0), preserving the internal structure and values.
 * Compute a centroid (e.g., average row position) for sorting; sort components by *increasing* centroid row (top-first in original grid) rather than decreasing, as the current decreasing sort (bottom-first) leads to reversed order in output.
 * Placement must avoid overlaps: when placing a shape, check that target cells are empty (0) or match the value (though ideally empty since shapes are distinct); try positions starting from top-left (smallest row, then smallest column) within bounds, but the expected outputs have leading zero rows (e.g., rows 0-3 empty in train1), suggesting shapes are packed starting from a specific baseline (e.g., row 4) or only after sorting and fitting without forcing top placement.
 * Output grid is same size as input (n x n), initialized to zeros; all original shapes must be placed exactly, without rotation, scaling, or modification, and unused areas remain 0.
 * Subtle: Components may have irregular shapes (e.g., spaced cells like "E" or "H" forms in expected), holes aren't mentioned but shouldn't affect connectivity; ensure no out-of-bounds placement; if a shape can't fit in a "preferred" spot, fallback to bottom-left may overwrite or misplace, but expecteds suggest all fit cleanly when ordered correctly.
 * Grids seem square (e.g., 22x22 for train1/2, possibly 26x26 for test based on line lengths); values are small positives (1-9), zeros are empty.
 * Potential for multiple components of same value? Treat as separate if not connected.
 * Ordering impacts placement: wrong sort leads to shapes appearing in incorrect vertical sequence (e.g., bottom shapes at top of output).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    n = len(g)

                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited.add((i, j))
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y, g[x][y]))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == val and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                            visited.add((nx, ny))
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```

```python
def get_rel_shape(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # Helpful: normalizes to (0,0) origin, preserves values. No changes needed.
    if not component:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _, _ in component)
    min_c = min(c for _, c, _ in component)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c, v) for r, c, v in component]
```

```python
def get_centroid(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> float:
    # Helpful for sorting by original position (average row). But sort by increasing (not -x[0]).
    if not component:
        return 0.0
    total_r = sum(r for r, _, _ in component)
    return total_r / len(component)
```

```python
def get_dimensions(rel_shape: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Helpful: computes height/width for placement bounds. No changes needed.
    if not rel_shape:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, _, _ in rel_shape)
    max_c = max(c for _, c, _ in rel_shape)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core issue: find_components merges adjacent cells of different values into single components (e.g., 3's connected to 2's), leading to distorted shapes that don't match expecteds (e.g., in train1 generated, hybrid 3-2-5-4-1 blobs at top; in train2, mixed 8-2-1-3-4-6; test has jumbled 3-2-7-9-4-1-8).
 * Sorting by decreasing centroid (-x[0]) places bottom-original shapes first/at top of output, but expecteds have top-original shapes higher (e.g., train1 expected starts with horizontal 3's at row4, likely a top shape; train2 expected has 6's at row4, then 8's/2's/1's/3's/4's lower—suggests increasing sort for top-first placement).
 * Placement loop starts from top (sr=0), filling immediately, causing no leading zero rows (e.g., train1 generated fills row0 with 3's/2's/5's; expecteds have rows 0-3 zero); fallback to bottom-left (sr=n-height) sometimes used but overwrites or mispositions when can't place (e.g., test generated has shapes crammed at top rows 0-8, ignoring potential baseline).
 * Overlap check is partially correct (avoids different values), but since components are wrong, it leads to partial placements or skips; expecteds have no overlaps and exact shape preservation (e.g., train1 expected has isolated "E"-like 8's, spaced 3's/2's, L-shaped 4's with 1's/2's/5's—no merging).
 * get_rel_shape, get_centroid, get_dimensions are helpful and correct for normalization/sizing/sorting.
 * Overall program structure (extract -> sort -> place sequentially) is a good skeleton, but broken by connectivity and sort/placement logic; no rotation or value changes attempted (correct, as expecteds preserve them).
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has dense top-packed hybrids (e.g., row0: 3's then 2/5's; row3: 8's/5's/4's/1's), expected has clean separate shapes lower (e.g., row4: 3's row; row5: spaced 3's; row7: 8's row; row12: 4's with attachments; unknown why baseline at row4, perhaps implicit padding or sort order).
 * Train2 mismatches: generated mixes at top (row0: 8's/2's/6's; row1: 8's/1's/3's/4's/6's), expected has separate lower (row4: 6's; row5: spaced 6's/8's; row8: spaced 2's/1's/3's; row13: 4's—reversed order effect).
 * Test output: Does not look correct—shapes are merged/hybrid (e.g., row0 starts with 3's/2's; row1 has 7's block with 4's/2's/1's/8's mixed; row5 has 8's block with 2's/9's), placed densely at top (rows 0-8 filled, rest zero), ignoring leading zeros and exact separations; expecteds suggest clean, separate components packed lower/mid-grid in original order (likely top-first), so this is invalid (e.g., 7/9 blocks should be isolated, not adjacent to 4's/1's unless same-value connected, which they're not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it's a messy top-packed grid with merged shapes (e.g., 3's adjacent to 2's in row0, 7's block bleeding into 4's/1's/8's in rows1-2), no leading zero rows, and incomplete lower placement (rows9+ all zero, suggesting failed placements or early stops); this mismatches expected patterns from training (clean, separate same-value blobs, starting after zero rows ~row4, in sorted order without hybrids).
 * Likely wrong due to same-value connectivity bug (merges distinct objects like 3-2, 7-4-1-8) and top-first placement without padding/baseline, causing overlap avoidance failures; to handle test, fix to same-value components, sort increasing centroid, and add baseline start (e.g., sr from 4) or pack only after all zeros above.

[2025-10-02 00:34:06] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 00:49:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent colors or blobs, and the task is to extract connected components (blobs of the same non-2 color, including adjacent 2's as connectors or wildcards) from an input grid and rearrange them into a new output grid by stacking them vertically from top to bottom with horizontal centering, while handling special cases for components touching the top or bottom edges and avoiding overlaps by shifting downward or horizontally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-directional (up, down, left, right) flood fill for cells of the same color (non-2), and must include all adjacent 2's (which act as bridges or attachments to the main blob, even if not same color).
 * Components touching the bottom edge (max row == n-1) should be placed higher up in the output (e.g., starting around row 4-5), while top-touching components (min row == 0) are placed lower (e.g., row 7-8), suggesting an inversion or "flipping" of edge-touching blobs to simulate a puzzle like stacking or inverting layers.
 * Remaining components are placed in order of their original minimum row (ascending), centered horizontally ((n - width)//2), and shifted downward (dy +=1) if they overlap with already placed content; horizontal shifts (dx adjustments) are a fallback but often lead to misalignment if overused.
 * 2's are neutral/empty in isolation but get absorbed into adjacent non-2 components; standalone 2's or unabsorbed 2's may need separate handling, but the program assumes they attach only during flood fill.
 * Overlap detection must check if target cell is occupied by a different value (out[nr][nc] != 0 and != val), allowing same-color overlaps but preventing conflicts; however, vertical packing can be tight, sometimes allowing row overlaps if shapes interlock.
 * Grid size is fixed (e.g., 22x22 for train1, 26x26? for test), with lots of leading/trailing 0's, implying the output should be sparse and centered overall.
 * Subtle: After placing special components, remove them from the list to avoid re-placement; sorting by original min row ensures stable ordering, but dy resets and dx shifts can cause cascading misplacements if the initial dy=0 assumption fails early.
 * Potential for shape distortion: When placing, relative positions are preserved (nr = start_r + (r - min_r_comp)), but if components have irregular shapes (e.g., with holes or protrusions), centering based on min/max col may clip or misalign protrusions.
 * 0's are background/empty; output must fill only where components are placed, leaving rest as 0.
 * Puzzle may involve "inverting" or "reflecting" the grid's vertical structure, as bottom-touching goes to top in output, suggesting a flow or stacking mechanic like in a physics simulation or layer puzzle.

                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```
(This flood fill is useful for extracting core same-color components accurately.)

            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and g[ni][nj] == 2 and (ni, nj) not in adj_twos:
                adj_twos.add((ni, nj))
                component.append((ni, nj, 2))
    return component
```
(This attaches 2's correctly to components, which is key for shape integrity, but note it only adds once per component and doesn't recurse for chained 2's.)

```python
def place_component(comp: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], start_r: int, out: List[List[int]], n: int):
    if not comp:
        return
    min_r_comp = min(r for r, _, _ in comp)
    min_c = min(c for _, c, _ in comp)
    max_c = max(c for _, c, _ in comp)
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    target_left = (n - w) // 2
    dx = target_left - min_c
    h = max(r for r, _, _ in comp) - min_r_comp + 1
    for r, c, val in comp:
        nr = start_r + (r - min_r_comp)
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:
            out[nr][nc] = val
```
(This placement logic with relative offsets and centering is helpful but needs better overlap avoidance integration.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly implements flood fill for components and attachment of adjacent 2's, which preserves blob shapes including connectors, and identifies top/bottom-touching components accurately.
 * It worked partially for horizontal centering (target_left = (n - w)//2) and relative positioning within components, as seen in the generated outputs where blobs maintain their internal structure (e.g., 8's shapes in train1).
 * However, placement of special components (bottom at row 4, top at row 7) is too rigid and doesn't adapt to grid size or other components, leading to overlaps or gaps; in train1, bottom_comp (likely the 1's or 4's) is placed too low, causing the 8's to appear in row 8 instead of row 7 as expected.
 * Remaining components sorting by min_r is good, but the overlap avoidance loop (dy +=1, reset if too low, then dx +=1) is flawed—it doesn't check full height (h) before placing, causes infinite-like shifts in dense cases, and doesn't try multiple dy/dx combinations efficiently, resulting in misplacements like the 3's and 5's in train1 being scattered (e.g., 3's in row 4 expected but generated in row 18-20).
 * In train1, generated output has 8's correctly shaped but shifted right and down (rows 8-10 vs expected 7-9), 1's fragmented (row 12-18 with extras), and bottom elements like 4's/3's inverted wrong (generated row 17-20 vs expected row 4/18); specifically, expected has 3's blob at top (row4-5) which generated misses entirely in that position, and 5's/1's interlocking at bottom which generated flattens.
 * In train2, generated places 6's correctly at top but without adjacent 8's integration (expected merges 6's and 8's starting row5), 3's/1's/4's jumbled mid-grid (e.g., generated row13 has 4's/1's mixed wrong vs expected row8-13 with clean 1's bar and 3's), and bottom 8's missing (generated has them low but detached); unknown why 2's bridges fail to connect 8's properly here.
 * Removal of special components after placement works (avoids duplicates), but the fallback dx shift after dy overflow is unhelpful as it often pushes components off-center without resolving vertical packing, leading to empty rows (e.g., rows 0-6 empty in train2 generated vs expected starting row4).
 * The add_adjacent_twos function is helpful but limited— it adds 2's only to the initial component without recursing if 2's connect multiple blobs, potentially missing chained attachments; not broken but incomplete for complex 2-networks.
 * Overall, the program understands component extraction (helpful for blob isolation) but fails on packing logic, with no training example passing due to poor overlap handling and fixed start rows (4 and 7) that don't scale (e.g., train1 22x22 vs train2 similar but different densities).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (26x26 grid) does not look correct, as it places components in a scattered, non-stacked manner: e.g., small 8's/2's at top (rows1-3) but isolated, large 8's/9's/4's mid-grid (rows8-16) with awkward 2's intrusions, and bottom 1's/3's/7's (rows20-25) not centered or packed tightly, leaving huge empty spaces (rows3-7 empty).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: no clear inversion of edge-touchers (e.g., likely bottom 7's blob should be high up like train1's 3's, but generated low at row21-22), 2's are over-absorbed (e.g., row15 has 2's splitting 9's/4's unnaturally vs expected clean merges), and overall vertical stacking is broken with overlaps ignored (e.g., row13 9's/2's overlap potential but forced).
 * Components like the large 7's bar at row21 seem detached from 3's above, unlike training where bottom-touchers invert to top; the right-side placements (e.g., 7's cols21-26) are off-center, suggesting dx shift failed without proper width calc for irregular shapes.
 * 9's blob (rows12-16) is centered but shifted down too far, blocking potential top placements for edge components; unknown why 1's are in a thin vertical bar (rows17-20) instead of a wide base like expected interlocking in trains.
 * Empty rows and fragmented 2's (e.g., row0 all 0's, row23-25 sparse) indicate incomplete packing—test likely needs tighter vertical flow starting from row0 or4, but generated wastes space, making it look like a failed stacking rather than a solved puzzle.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of connected components (blobs or shapes) from an input grid, where each component consists of cells with the same positive integer value (representing distinct objects or colors), followed by normalizing their relative shapes, sorting them based on their original positions in the input (likely by row centroid to preserve top-to-bottom order), and reassembling them into a new output grid by placing them without overlap in a specific order and position (e.g., packing from the top-left available space, but potentially starting from a baseline row or in sorted order to match expected layouts with leading zero rows).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components must be connected orthogonally (4 directions: up, down, left, right) and only cells with the *exact same value* (>0) should be grouped together—do not merge different values, even if adjacent, as this creates invalid oversized or hybrid shapes.
 * Normalize shapes relative to the minimum row and column in each component to get a "bounding box" origin at (0,0), preserving the internal structure and values.
 * Compute a centroid (e.g., average row position) for sorting; sort components by *increasing* centroid row (top-first in original grid) rather than decreasing, as the current decreasing sort (bottom-first) leads to reversed order in output.
 * Placement must avoid overlaps: when placing a shape, check that target cells are empty (0) or match the value (though ideally empty since shapes are distinct); try positions starting from top-left (smallest row, then smallest column) within bounds, but the expected outputs have leading zero rows (e.g., rows 0-3 empty in train1), suggesting shapes are packed starting from a specific baseline (e.g., row 4) or only after sorting and fitting without forcing top placement.
 * Output grid is same size as input (n x n), initialized to zeros; all original shapes must be placed exactly, without rotation, scaling, or modification, and unused areas remain 0.
 * Subtle: Components may have irregular shapes (e.g., spaced cells like "E" or "H" forms in expected), holes aren't mentioned but shouldn't affect connectivity; ensure no out-of-bounds placement; if a shape can't fit in a "preferred" spot, fallback to bottom-left may overwrite or misplace, but expecteds suggest all fit cleanly when ordered correctly.
 * Grids seem square (e.g., 22x22 for train1/2, possibly 26x26 for test based on line lengths); values are small positives (1-9), zeros are empty.
 * Potential for multiple components of same value? Treat as separate if not connected.
 * Ordering impacts placement: wrong sort leads to shapes appearing in incorrect vertical sequence (e.g., bottom shapes at top of output).

    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core issue: find_components merges adjacent cells of different values into single components (e.g., 3's connected to 2's), leading to distorted shapes that don't match expecteds (e.g., in train1 generated, hybrid 3-2-5-4-1 blobs at top; in train2, mixed 8-2-1-3-4-6; test has jumbled 3-2-7-9-4-1-8).
 * Sorting by decreasing centroid (-x[0]) places bottom-original shapes first/at top of output, but expecteds have top-original shapes higher (e.g., train1 expected starts with horizontal 3's at row4, likely a top shape; train2 expected has 6's at row4, then 8's/2's/1's/3's/4's lower—suggests increasing sort for top-first placement).
 * Placement loop starts from top (sr=0), filling immediately, causing no leading zero rows (e.g., train1 generated fills row0 with 3's/2's/5's; expecteds have rows 0-3 zero); fallback to bottom-left (sr=n-height) sometimes used but overwrites or mispositions when can't place (e.g., test generated has shapes crammed at top rows 0-8, ignoring potential baseline).
 * Overlap check is partially correct (avoids different values), but since components are wrong, it leads to partial placements or skips; expecteds have no overlaps and exact shape preservation (e.g., train1 expected has isolated "E"-like 8's, spaced 3's/2's, L-shaped 4's with 1's/2's/5's—no merging).
 * get_rel_shape, get_centroid, get_dimensions are helpful and correct for normalization/sizing/sorting.
 * Overall program structure (extract -> sort -> place sequentially) is a good skeleton, but broken by connectivity and sort/placement logic; no rotation or value changes attempted (correct, as expecteds preserve them).
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has dense top-packed hybrids (e.g., row0: 3's then 2/5's; row3: 8's/5's/4's/1's), expected has clean separate shapes lower (e.g., row4: 3's row; row5: spaced 3's; row7: 8's row; row12: 4's with attachments; unknown why baseline at row4, perhaps implicit padding or sort order).
 * Train2 mismatches: generated mixes at top (row0: 8's/2's/6's; row1: 8's/1's/3's/4's/6's), expected has separate lower (row4: 6's; row5: spaced 6's/8's; row8: spaced 2's/1's/3's; row13: 4's—reversed order effect).
 * Test output: Does not look correct—shapes are merged/hybrid (e.g., row0 starts with 3's/2's; row1 has 7's block with 4's/2's/1's/8's mixed; row5 has 8's block with 2's/9's), placed densely at top (rows 0-8 filled, rest zero), ignoring leading zeros and exact separations; expecteds suggest clean, separate components packed lower/mid-grid in original order (likely top-first), so this is invalid (e.g., 7/9 blocks should be isolated, not adjacent to 4's/1's unless same-value connected, which they're not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it's a messy top-packed grid with merged shapes (e.g., 3's adjacent to 2's in row0, 7's block bleeding into 4's/1's/8's in rows1-2), no leading zero rows, and incomplete lower placement (rows9+ all zero, suggesting failed placements or early stops); this mismatches expected patterns from training (clean, separate same-value blobs, starting after zero rows ~row4, in sorted order without hybrids).
 * Likely wrong due to same-value connectivity bug (merges distinct objects like 3-2, 7-4-1-8) and top-first placement without padding/baseline, causing overlap avoidance failures; to handle test, fix to same-value components, sort increasing centroid, and add baseline start (e.g., sr from 4) or pack only after all zeros above.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 01:14:58] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual rearrangement puzzle where the input grid contains connected components (blobs or shapes) of numbered cells (1-9, excluding 2's which act as connectors or extensions), and the goal is to extract these components, optionally augment them with adjacent or implied 2's based on touching top/bottom edges, order them by specific criteria (e.g., bottom-touching, top-touching, centroid height), and place them into a new empty grid in a stacked, centered manner with collision avoidance and horizontal shifts to form a coherent output image, likely representing a reorganized diagram or scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are found via flood fill for cells >0 and !=2, treating same-number adjacent (4-directional) cells as one object; 2's are not part of main components but can be attached if adjacent and below/above the main blob.
 * 2's above the minimum row of a main component (upper 2's) indicate "top touch" and may add an extra score or extension count, but are not included in the component itself; only unique upper 2's are counted.
 * Attached lower 2's (below or at min row) are flood-filled and added to the component if connected via 2's, extending the shape downward; this affects bottom-touch detection (if max row >= n-2).
 * For top-touching components, add "extra" 2's below the bottom row of the main component, in columns matching the bottom-most row's columns (up to the number of unique upper 2's), sorted by column to align left-to-right.
 * Ordering: Prioritize bottom-touching components first (take at most 1), then top-touching (at most 1), then remaining sorted by centroid row (lower centroid first?); if no top-touch, select the top-most (min min_r_main) as first.
 * Placement: Start at baseline row 4, center horizontally ((n - width)//2), use small horizontal shift (2) for top-touch components, larger (10) for others; for subsequent placements, search for lowest possible dy (tight packing above current max_r), preferring rightmost fitting dx within shift range to avoid overlaps; fallback to below current_max_r if no fit.
 * Subtleties: Components must be translated to relative coordinates from their collective min_r/min_c (including attached/extra 2's); overlaps are forbidden (out[nr][nc] must be 0); n=22 for all grids; 0's are empty; output must exactly match expected shapes/positions, including all 2's and numbers; missing or extra cells (e.g., unplaced components or wrong augmentations) cause failure.
 * Easy to miss: Upper 2's only count if strictly above min_r_main and adjacent; extra 2's for top-touch are placed exactly one row below the main's bottom, only in bottom-row columns (limited by upper_count); centroid is average row of main_comp only (ignores attached 2's); bottom-touch uses extended max_r with attached but not extra; if multiple bottom/top, only first is prioritized (unspecified tiebreaker); empty components skipped; all_cells_abs may be empty but fallback to main mins.
 * General: Preserve original values (e.g., 3's stay 3); no rotation/scaling; grid is square (22x22); puzzle likely assembles a larger scene (e.g., figures, bars, bases) where order creates narrative (bottom foundations, top elements, fillers).

    # Helpful: Correctly isolates main components excluding 2's; can be reused for 2's attachment.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single submission shown) correctly identifies and floods main components excluding 2's, augments with lower attached 2's via separate flood, and adds extra 2's for top-touch based on upper count and bottom columns.
 * Train 1: Generated output places 3's,5's,1's,8's,2's in wrong positions/rows (e.g., 3's high up with 5's adjacent but not matching expected stacked layout starting at row 4 with 3's/2's/8's/2's then lower 4/1/5 groups); misses many components (no 4's at all, wrong 1's shape, extra/missing 2's); 8's and 2's partially match but shifted; overall too sparse and high-placed, ignoring expected tight low packing.
 * Train 1: Bottom-touch detection likely wrong (e.g., 5's or 1's should extend with 2's to touch bottom?); ordering fails (starts with wrong first component, centroids not sorting fillers correctly); placement search prefers wrong dy/dx (e.g., not tight enough, wrong shift for top-touch).
 * Train 2: Generated output places 8's and 6's high, then 4's/2's mid, but misses most components (no 1's,3's at all; sparse 4's without extensions); expected has interleaved 6/8/2/1/3/4/2's in a complex mid-low stack; attachment of 2's to 4's wrong (shows isolated 2's); ordering ignores top/bottom touches (6's top-touch? 4's bottom?).
 * Train 2: Placement fallback too early (leaves bottom empty); shift logic pushes things right but not enough to fit all; rel_comp min_r_all incorrect for augmented shapes.
 * General issues: Only processes non-2 >0, but may skip implied components; upper_count over/under-counts if non-adjacent; extra 2's placed but not flood-connected; order takes [:1] for multiples but may pick wrong one; search for best_dy prefers low but not always tight (inf fallback too high); no handling for wide components overflowing center+shift.
 * Function `flood` is helpful and correct for isolation.
 * Function `process_component` is mostly helpful but buggy in attached 2's stack init (sets visited early, may miss some); extra_abs logic good but num=min(upper,len(bottom)) may under-add.
 * Function `place` is helpful and correct.
 * Overall program in `program` has good structure (components list, ordering, placement loop) but fails on integration (wrong order/positions lead to missing elements, overlaps not detected properly in search).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places a 3-blob (possibly top-touch with extras?) high up (rows 0-3) adjacent to a 9-blob, then 8's mid (rows 4-8) with isolated 2 below, leaving most of the grid empty below row 8; this is too top-heavy and sparse, missing likely lower components (e.g., no 1's,4's,5's,6's,7's visible, assuming test has more numbers).
 * Expected likely mirrors training: A stacked layout starting low (baseline ~4) with bottom-touch bases (e.g., extended 9's or 8's touching near row 20), then mid fillers, top elements with 2's connectors; current output ignores tight packing (huge empty space below), wrong ordering (3's and 9's first but not bottom-touch), and incomplete extraction (only 2-3 components placed, others dropped?); 3's shape augmented wrong (extra 3's? but shows connected); 8's missing parts (incomplete flood?); no horizontal alignment/collision avoidance working (9's overhang right).
 * To handle test: Ensure all components extracted/placed (e.g., if test has more blobs like train1/2); adjust ordering to prioritize true bottom-touch (with attached max_r); increase shift range or change dx preference (min abs instead of max?); verify 2's attachment includes all connected even non-adjacent starts.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 01:14:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent colors or blobs, and the task is to extract connected components (blobs of the same non-2 color, including adjacent 2's as connectors or wildcards) from an input grid and rearrange them into a new output grid by stacking them vertically from top to bottom with horizontal centering, while handling special cases for components touching the top or bottom edges and avoiding overlaps by shifting downward or horizontally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-directional (up, down, left, right) flood fill for cells of the same color (non-2), and must include all adjacent 2's (which act as bridges or attachments to the main blob, even if not same color).
 * Components touching the bottom edge (max row == n-1) should be placed higher up in the output (e.g., starting around row 4-5), while top-touching components (min row == 0) are placed lower (e.g., row 7-8), suggesting an inversion or "flipping" of edge-touching blobs to simulate a puzzle like stacking or inverting layers.
 * Remaining components are placed in order of their original minimum row (ascending), centered horizontally ((n - width)//2), and shifted downward (dy +=1) if they overlap with already placed content; horizontal shifts (dx adjustments) are a fallback but often lead to misalignment if overused.
 * 2's are neutral/empty in isolation but get absorbed into adjacent non-2 components; standalone 2's or unabsorbed 2's may need separate handling, but the program assumes they attach only during flood fill.
 * Overlap detection must check if target cell is occupied by a different value (out[nr][nc] != 0 and != val), allowing same-color overlaps but preventing conflicts; however, vertical packing can be tight, sometimes allowing row overlaps if shapes interlock.
 * Grid size is fixed (e.g., 22x22 for train1, 26x26? for test), with lots of leading/trailing 0's, implying the output should be sparse and centered overall.
 * Subtle: After placing special components, remove them from the list to avoid re-placement; sorting by original min row ensures stable ordering, but dy resets and dx shifts can cause cascading misplacements if the initial dy=0 assumption fails early.
 * Potential for shape distortion: When placing, relative positions are preserved (nr = start_r + (r - min_r_comp)), but if components have irregular shapes (e.g., with holes or protrusions), centering based on min/max col may clip or misalign protrusions.
 * 0's are background/empty; output must fill only where components are placed, leaving rest as 0.
 * Puzzle may involve "inverting" or "reflecting" the grid's vertical structure, as bottom-touching goes to top in output, suggesting a flow or stacking mechanic like in a physics simulation or layer puzzle.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def flood(start_i: int, start_j: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    component = []
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        if visited[i][j] or g[i][j] != c:
            continue
        visited[i][j] = True
        component.append((i, j, c))
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == c:
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```
(This flood fill is useful for extracting core same-color components accurately.)

```python
def add_adjacent_twos(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    adj_twos = set()
    for i, j, _ in component:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and g[ni][nj] == 2 and (ni, nj) not in adj_twos:
                adj_twos.add((ni, nj))
                component.append((ni, nj, 2))
    return component
```
(This attaches 2's correctly to components, which is key for shape integrity, but note it only adds once per component and doesn't recurse for chained 2's.)

```python
def place_component(comp: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], start_r: int, out: List[List[int]], n: int):
    if not comp:
        return
    min_r_comp = min(r for r, _, _ in comp)
    min_c = min(c for _, c, _ in comp)
    max_c = max(c for _, c, _ in comp)
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    target_left = (n - w) // 2
    dx = target_left - min_c
    h = max(r for r, _, _ in comp) - min_r_comp + 1
    for r, c, val in comp:
        nr = start_r + (r - min_r_comp)
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:
            out[nr][nc] = val
```
(This placement logic with relative offsets and centering is helpful but needs better overlap avoidance integration.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly implements flood fill for components and attachment of adjacent 2's, which preserves blob shapes including connectors, and identifies top/bottom-touching components accurately.
 * It worked partially for horizontal centering (target_left = (n - w)//2) and relative positioning within components, as seen in the generated outputs where blobs maintain their internal structure (e.g., 8's shapes in train1).
 * However, placement of special components (bottom at row 4, top at row 7) is too rigid and doesn't adapt to grid size or other components, leading to overlaps or gaps; in train1, bottom_comp (likely the 1's or 4's) is placed too low, causing the 8's to appear in row 8 instead of row 7 as expected.
 * Remaining components sorting by min_r is good, but the overlap avoidance loop (dy +=1, reset if too low, then dx +=1) is flawed—it doesn't check full height (h) before placing, causes infinite-like shifts in dense cases, and doesn't try multiple dy/dx combinations efficiently, resulting in misplacements like the 3's and 5's in train1 being scattered (e.g., 3's in row 4 expected but generated in row 18-20).
 * In train1, generated output has 8's correctly shaped but shifted right and down (rows 8-10 vs expected 7-9), 1's fragmented (row 12-18 with extras), and bottom elements like 4's/3's inverted wrong (generated row 17-20 vs expected row 4/18); specifically, expected has 3's blob at top (row4-5) which generated misses entirely in that position, and 5's/1's interlocking at bottom which generated flattens.
 * In train2, generated places 6's correctly at top but without adjacent 8's integration (expected merges 6's and 8's starting row5), 3's/1's/4's jumbled mid-grid (e.g., generated row13 has 4's/1's mixed wrong vs expected row8-13 with clean 1's bar and 3's), and bottom 8's missing (generated has them low but detached); unknown why 2's bridges fail to connect 8's properly here.
 * Removal of special components after placement works (avoids duplicates), but the fallback dx shift after dy overflow is unhelpful as it often pushes components off-center without resolving vertical packing, leading to empty rows (e.g., rows 0-6 empty in train2 generated vs expected starting row4).
 * The add_adjacent_twos function is helpful but limited— it adds 2's only to the initial component without recursing if 2's connect multiple blobs, potentially missing chained attachments; not broken but incomplete for complex 2-networks.
 * Overall, the program understands component extraction (helpful for blob isolation) but fails on packing logic, with no training example passing due to poor overlap handling and fixed start rows (4 and 7) that don't scale (e.g., train1 22x22 vs train2 similar but different densities).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (26x26 grid) does not look correct, as it places components in a scattered, non-stacked manner: e.g., small 8's/2's at top (rows1-3) but isolated, large 8's/9's/4's mid-grid (rows8-16) with awkward 2's intrusions, and bottom 1's/3's/7's (rows20-25) not centered or packed tightly, leaving huge empty spaces (rows3-7 empty).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: no clear inversion of edge-touchers (e.g., likely bottom 7's blob should be high up like train1's 3's, but generated low at row21-22), 2's are over-absorbed (e.g., row15 has 2's splitting 9's/4's unnaturally vs expected clean merges), and overall vertical stacking is broken with overlaps ignored (e.g., row13 9's/2's overlap potential but forced).
 * Components like the large 7's bar at row21 seem detached from 3's above, unlike training where bottom-touchers invert to top; the right-side placements (e.g., 7's cols21-26) are off-center, suggesting dx shift failed without proper width calc for irregular shapes.
 * 9's blob (rows12-16) is centered but shifted down too far, blocking potential top placements for edge components; unknown why 1's are in a thin vertical bar (rows17-20) instead of a wide base like expected interlocking in trains.
 * Empty rows and fragmented 2's (e.g., row0 all 0's, row23-25 sparse) indicate incomplete packing—test likely needs tighter vertical flow starting from row0 or4, but generated wastes space, making it look like a failed stacking rather than a solved puzzle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual rearrangement puzzle where the input grid contains connected components (blobs or shapes) of numbered cells (1-9, excluding 2's which act as connectors or extensions), and the goal is to extract these components, optionally augment them with adjacent or implied 2's based on touching top/bottom edges, order them by specific criteria (e.g., bottom-touching, top-touching, centroid height), and place them into a new empty grid in a stacked, centered manner with collision avoidance and horizontal shifts to form a coherent output image, likely representing a reorganized diagram or scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are found via flood fill for cells >0 and !=2, treating same-number adjacent (4-directional) cells as one object; 2's are not part of main components but can be attached if adjacent and below/above the main blob.
 * 2's above the minimum row of a main component (upper 2's) indicate "top touch" and may add an extra score or extension count, but are not included in the component itself; only unique upper 2's are counted.
 * Attached lower 2's (below or at min row) are flood-filled and added to the component if connected via 2's, extending the shape downward; this affects bottom-touch detection (if max row >= n-2).
 * For top-touching components, add "extra" 2's below the bottom row of the main component, in columns matching the bottom-most row's columns (up to the number of unique upper 2's), sorted by column to align left-to-right.
 * Ordering: Prioritize bottom-touching components first (take at most 1), then top-touching (at most 1), then remaining sorted by centroid row (lower centroid first?); if no top-touch, select the top-most (min min_r_main) as first.
 * Placement: Start at baseline row 4, center horizontally ((n - width)//2), use small horizontal shift (2) for top-touch components, larger (10) for others; for subsequent placements, search for lowest possible dy (tight packing above current max_r), preferring rightmost fitting dx within shift range to avoid overlaps; fallback to below current_max_r if no fit.
 * Subtleties: Components must be translated to relative coordinates from their collective min_r/min_c (including attached/extra 2's); overlaps are forbidden (out[nr][nc] must be 0); n=22 for all grids; 0's are empty; output must exactly match expected shapes/positions, including all 2's and numbers; missing or extra cells (e.g., unplaced components or wrong augmentations) cause failure.
 * Easy to miss: Upper 2's only count if strictly above min_r_main and adjacent; extra 2's for top-touch are placed exactly one row below the main's bottom, only in bottom-row columns (limited by upper_count); centroid is average row of main_comp only (ignores attached 2's); bottom-touch uses extended max_r with attached but not extra; if multiple bottom/top, only first is prioritized (unspecified tiebreaker); empty components skipped; all_cells_abs may be empty but fallback to main mins.
 * General: Preserve original values (e.g., 3's stay 3); no rotation/scaling; grid is square (22x22); puzzle likely assembles a larger scene (e.g., figures, bars, bases) where order creates narrative (bottom foundations, top elements, fillers).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single submission shown) correctly identifies and floods main components excluding 2's, augments with lower attached 2's via separate flood, and adds extra 2's for top-touch based on upper count and bottom columns.
 * Train 1: Generated output places 3's,5's,1's,8's,2's in wrong positions/rows (e.g., 3's high up with 5's adjacent but not matching expected stacked layout starting at row 4 with 3's/2's/8's/2's then lower 4/1/5 groups); misses many components (no 4's at all, wrong 1's shape, extra/missing 2's); 8's and 2's partially match but shifted; overall too sparse and high-placed, ignoring expected tight low packing.
 * Train 1: Bottom-touch detection likely wrong (e.g., 5's or 1's should extend with 2's to touch bottom?); ordering fails (starts with wrong first component, centroids not sorting fillers correctly); placement search prefers wrong dy/dx (e.g., not tight enough, wrong shift for top-touch).
 * Train 2: Generated output places 8's and 6's high, then 4's/2's mid, but misses most components (no 1's,3's at all; sparse 4's without extensions); expected has interleaved 6/8/2/1/3/4/2's in a complex mid-low stack; attachment of 2's to 4's wrong (shows isolated 2's); ordering ignores top/bottom touches (6's top-touch? 4's bottom?).
 * Train 2: Placement fallback too early (leaves bottom empty); shift logic pushes things right but not enough to fit all; rel_comp min_r_all incorrect for augmented shapes.
 * General issues: Only processes non-2 >0, but may skip implied components; upper_count over/under-counts if non-adjacent; extra 2's placed but not flood-connected; order takes [:1] for multiples but may pick wrong one; search for best_dy prefers low but not always tight (inf fallback too high); no handling for wide components overflowing center+shift.
 * Function `flood` is helpful and correct for isolation.
 * Function `process_component` is mostly helpful but buggy in attached 2's stack init (sets visited early, may miss some); extra_abs logic good but num=min(upper,len(bottom)) may under-add.
 * Function `place` is helpful and correct.
 * Overall program in `program` has good structure (components list, ordering, placement loop) but fails on integration (wrong order/positions lead to missing elements, overlaps not detected properly in search).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places a 3-blob (possibly top-touch with extras?) high up (rows 0-3) adjacent to a 9-blob, then 8's mid (rows 4-8) with isolated 2 below, leaving most of the grid empty below row 8; this is too top-heavy and sparse, missing likely lower components (e.g., no 1's,4's,5's,6's,7's visible, assuming test has more numbers).
 * Expected likely mirrors training: A stacked layout starting low (baseline ~4) with bottom-touch bases (e.g., extended 9's or 8's touching near row 20), then mid fillers, top elements with 2's connectors; current output ignores tight packing (huge empty space below), wrong ordering (3's and 9's first but not bottom-touch), and incomplete extraction (only 2-3 components placed, others dropped?); 3's shape augmented wrong (extra 3's? but shows connected); 8's missing parts (incomplete flood?); no horizontal alignment/collision avoidance working (9's overhang right).
 * To handle test: Ensure all components extracted/placed (e.g., if test has more blobs like train1/2); adjust ordering to prioritize true bottom-touch (with attached max_r); increase shift range or change dx preference (min abs instead of max?); verify 2's attachment includes all connected even non-adjacent starts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of connected components (blobs or shapes) from an input grid, where each component consists of cells with the same positive integer value (representing distinct objects or colors), followed by normalizing their relative shapes, sorting them based on their original positions in the input (likely by row centroid to preserve top-to-bottom order), and reassembling them into a new output grid by placing them without overlap in a specific order and position (e.g., packing from the top-left available space, but potentially starting from a baseline row or in sorted order to match expected layouts with leading zero rows).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components must be connected orthogonally (4 directions: up, down, left, right) and only cells with the *exact same value* (>0) should be grouped together—do not merge different values, even if adjacent, as this creates invalid oversized or hybrid shapes.
 * Normalize shapes relative to the minimum row and column in each component to get a "bounding box" origin at (0,0), preserving the internal structure and values.
 * Compute a centroid (e.g., average row position) for sorting; sort components by *increasing* centroid row (top-first in original grid) rather than decreasing, as the current decreasing sort (bottom-first) leads to reversed order in output.
 * Placement must avoid overlaps: when placing a shape, check that target cells are empty (0) or match the value (though ideally empty since shapes are distinct); try positions starting from top-left (smallest row, then smallest column) within bounds, but the expected outputs have leading zero rows (e.g., rows 0-3 empty in train1), suggesting shapes are packed starting from a specific baseline (e.g., row 4) or only after sorting and fitting without forcing top placement.
 * Output grid is same size as input (n x n), initialized to zeros; all original shapes must be placed exactly, without rotation, scaling, or modification, and unused areas remain 0.
 * Subtle: Components may have irregular shapes (e.g., spaced cells like "E" or "H" forms in expected), holes aren't mentioned but shouldn't affect connectivity; ensure no out-of-bounds placement; if a shape can't fit in a "preferred" spot, fallback to bottom-left may overwrite or misplace, but expecteds suggest all fit cleanly when ordered correctly.
 * Grids seem square (e.g., 22x22 for train1/2, possibly 26x26 for test based on line lengths); values are small positives (1-9), zeros are empty.
 * Potential for multiple components of same value? Treat as separate if not connected.
 * Ordering impacts placement: wrong sort leads to shapes appearing in incorrect vertical sequence (e.g., bottom shapes at top of output).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            if g[i][j] > 0 and (i, j) not in visited:
                val = g[i][j]  # Key: use this val for connectivity
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited.add((i, j))
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y, g[x][y]))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == val and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                            visited.add((nx, ny))
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```

```python
def get_rel_shape(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # Helpful: normalizes to (0,0) origin, preserves values. No changes needed.
    if not component:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _, _ in component)
    min_c = min(c for _, c, _ in component)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c, v) for r, c, v in component]
```

```python
def get_centroid(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> float:
    # Helpful for sorting by original position (average row). But sort by increasing (not -x[0]).
    if not component:
        return 0.0
    total_r = sum(r for r, _, _ in component)
    return total_r / len(component)
```

```python

    # Helpful: computes height/width for placement bounds. No changes needed.
    if not rel_shape:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, _, _ in rel_shape)
    max_c = max(c for _, c, _ in rel_shape)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core issue: find_components merges adjacent cells of different values into single components (e.g., 3's connected to 2's), leading to distorted shapes that don't match expecteds (e.g., in train1 generated, hybrid 3-2-5-4-1 blobs at top; in train2, mixed 8-2-1-3-4-6; test has jumbled 3-2-7-9-4-1-8).
 * Sorting by decreasing centroid (-x[0]) places bottom-original shapes first/at top of output, but expecteds have top-original shapes higher (e.g., train1 expected starts with horizontal 3's at row4, likely a top shape; train2 expected has 6's at row4, then 8's/2's/1's/3's/4's lower—suggests increasing sort for top-first placement).
 * Placement loop starts from top (sr=0), filling immediately, causing no leading zero rows (e.g., train1 generated fills row0 with 3's/2's/5's; expecteds have rows 0-3 zero); fallback to bottom-left (sr=n-height) sometimes used but overwrites or mispositions when can't place (e.g., test generated has shapes crammed at top rows 0-8, ignoring potential baseline).
 * Overlap check is partially correct (avoids different values), but since components are wrong, it leads to partial placements or skips; expecteds have no overlaps and exact shape preservation (e.g., train1 expected has isolated "E"-like 8's, spaced 3's/2's, L-shaped 4's with 1's/2's/5's—no merging).
 * get_rel_shape, get_centroid, get_dimensions are helpful and correct for normalization/sizing/sorting.
 * Overall program structure (extract -> sort -> place sequentially) is a good skeleton, but broken by connectivity and sort/placement logic; no rotation or value changes attempted (correct, as expecteds preserve them).
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has dense top-packed hybrids (e.g., row0: 3's then 2/5's; row3: 8's/5's/4's/1's), expected has clean separate shapes lower (e.g., row4: 3's row; row5: spaced 3's; row7: 8's row; row12: 4's with attachments; unknown why baseline at row4, perhaps implicit padding or sort order).
 * Train2 mismatches: generated mixes at top (row0: 8's/2's/6's; row1: 8's/1's/3's/4's/6's), expected has separate lower (row4: 6's; row5: spaced 6's/8's; row8: spaced 2's/1's/3's; row13: 4's—reversed order effect).
 * Test output: Does not look correct—shapes are merged/hybrid (e.g., row0 starts with 3's/2's; row1 has 7's block with 4's/2's/1's/8's mixed; row5 has 8's block with 2's/9's), placed densely at top (rows 0-8 filled, rest zero), ignoring leading zeros and exact separations; expecteds suggest clean, separate components packed lower/mid-grid in original order (likely top-first), so this is invalid (e.g., 7/9 blocks should be isolated, not adjacent to 4's/1's unless same-value connected, which they're not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it's a messy top-packed grid with merged shapes (e.g., 3's adjacent to 2's in row0, 7's block bleeding into 4's/1's/8's in rows1-2), no leading zero rows, and incomplete lower placement (rows9+ all zero, suggesting failed placements or early stops); this mismatches expected patterns from training (clean, separate same-value blobs, starting after zero rows ~row4, in sorted order without hybrids).
 * Likely wrong due to same-value connectivity bug (merges distinct objects like 3-2, 7-4-1-8) and top-first placement without padding/baseline, causing overlap avoidance failures; to handle test, fix to same-value components, sort increasing centroid, and add baseline start (e.g., sr from 4) or pack only after all zeros above.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 01:40:42] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (blobs) of colored numbers (non-2 values) from an input grid, augmenting them with attached 2's (likely representing connectors or fillers) under specific rules (e.g., only lower attachments, conditional extras based on upper 2's and edge touches), normalizing their relative shapes, ordering them by properties like centroid and special flags (bottom-touching or top-edge-touching), and then packing them into a new output grid with prioritized placement (e.g., bottom components low, top high, others packed with shifts to avoid conflicts while allowing overlaps of same values).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected groups of the same non-2 positive value using 4-directional flood fill; 2's are ignored for main components but can be attached or added conditionally.
 * For each component: Compute min/max rows/cols; count unique upper 2's (above min row) and check if they touch row 0 (top edge); flood-fill attach only lower 2's (row >= min row, connected via 2's); compute centroid (average row of main cells); flag bottom-touch if max row (including attached) >= n-2; if top-edge-touch, add extra 2's below the main bottom in up to upper_count columns (sorted, starting from leftmost bottom cols).
 * Normalize to relative coords (shift to (0,0) min); combine main + attached + extras into rel_comp.
 * Ordering: Identify unique bottom-touch (highest centroid) and top-edge-touch (lowest centroid) components first; remove them; sort remaining by descending centroid (higher rows first, i.e., "bottom-up" placement?); place bottom at fixed dy=4, top at current_max_r+1, others starting from max(4, current_max_r - allowance=4) with vertical increments and horizontal center/right shifts (up to 10) if center conflicts.
 * Placement allows overwriting with same value or empty (0), but rejects different values; track current_max_r for stacking; out-of-bounds cells are skipped.
 * Subtleties: Upper 2's are just counted/set for conditions but not attached to rel_comp; extra 2's only if top-edge-touch and placed exactly one row below main bottom in specific cols; bottom flag uses max_r including attached; components with no cells skipped; n=22 for train1/2, 26 for test; overlaps must preserve values exactly (no mixing different numbers).
 * Potential misses: Flood fill might over/under-connect if 2's bridge mains incorrectly (but code excludes 2's from main); extra 2's col selection uses sorted bottom cols, limited by min(upper_count, bottom_cols); placement shifts only right from center, no left; fixed dy=4 for bottom might be too low/high; allowance=4 for packing start might cause overlaps or gaps; centroid is row-only (ignores cols); multiple bottom/top picks highest/lowest centroid if ties.
 * All attempts must handle empty rows/cols in output; preserve exact shapes/colors; no rotation/flipping; 0's are background.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies and extracts main components via flood fill (helpful for isolating blobs like the 8's, 3's, etc.), computes centroids and relative shapes, and attempts ordered packing with conflict checks and shifts.
 * What worked: Component extraction seems accurate (e.g., groups 8's together, 3's, 4's); relative normalization shifts to (0,0); placement logic avoids hard conflicts by allowing same-val overlaps; tracks current_max_r for stacking.
 * What didn't work: Both training examples are incorrect, with major misplacements and missing/incorrect 2 attachments. In Train 1: Generated places 8's high (row1-3) but expected lower (row7-9); 3's fragmented/misattached (row4-5 with wrong 2's/5's overlap); 4's low but shifted wrong (includes extra 3's/1's); 1's and 5's scattered/missing connections; no top/bottom specials seem applied correctly (e.g., expected bottom 1's/5's low, but generated has them mid). Differences: Generated has 8's too high, 2's attached to wrong blobs (e.g., under 8's but expected under 3's/4's), 5's partial; unknown why extras/attachments flood wrong (perhaps lower 2's overconnect across components).
 * In Train 2: Generated packs 8's/6's/1's/3's/4's high/mid but ignores many connections/2's; e.g., 6's partial (missing full shape), 3's right but no attachments, 4's absent/low; expected has 6's top, 8's mid with 2's, 1's/3's/4's lower with 2's bridging. Differences: Generated misses lower packing (all crammed rows4-8, empty below); no 2's placed at all; components like 4's/1's fragmented or omitted; unknown why top/bottom flags failed (e.g., expected bottom 4's/3's low).
 * process_component likely buggy: Attached 2's might flood too broadly (connecting unrelated 2's); extras added wrong cols/rows (e.g., Train1 generated extras under 8's but expected elsewhere); bottom dy=4 too rigid (causes overlaps); shifts only right, no left/center retry; allowance=4 too small, causes vertical gaps/overlaps.
 * get_all_processed and main program helpful for orchestration but fail on ordering (e.g., bottom/top not prioritized correctly, leading to high placement of low-centroid items).
 * No unhelpful functions; all aim at puzzle but execution errs (e.g., flood is solid, but integration with 2's handling broken).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears jumbled and incomplete, with components partially placed but misaligned, missing connections, and no coherent packing (e.g., 8's scattered across rows1-10 without full shape, 9's fragmented in rows8-11, 7's/4's clumped mid but overlapping wrong like 3's into 2's area, 1's trailing low/right but disconnected; many empty rows below despite space). Expected likely a stacked arrangement: top-edge items high (e.g., perhaps 8's or 9's up with upper 2's implied), bottom-touch low (e.g., 1's/4's at bottom with attached 2's), others packed mid by descending centroid, with 2's bridging/filling per rules (e.g., extras under top-touch if row0 2's present). Differences: No 2's placed systematically (only sparse, e.g., row5 col15); shapes distorted (e.g., 8's not contiguous full blob); right-side crowding (7's/4's/1's shifted far); ignores potential bottom flag for low 1's; overall lacks vertical spacing/stacking, looks like failed shift/packing (e.g., dy starts too low, shifts push off-center without resolving conflicts). Unknown why 3's/9's partial, but clearly doesn't match expected clean, rule-based rearrangement.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 01:40:42] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent colors or blobs, and the task is to extract connected components (blobs of the same non-2 color, including adjacent 2's as connectors or wildcards) from an input grid and rearrange them into a new output grid by stacking them vertically from top to bottom with horizontal centering, while handling special cases for components touching the top or bottom edges and avoiding overlaps by shifting downward or horizontally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-directional (up, down, left, right) flood fill for cells of the same color (non-2), and must include all adjacent 2's (which act as bridges or attachments to the main blob, even if not same color).
 * Components touching the bottom edge (max row == n-1) should be placed higher up in the output (e.g., starting around row 4-5), while top-touching components (min row == 0) are placed lower (e.g., row 7-8), suggesting an inversion or "flipping" of edge-touching blobs to simulate a puzzle like stacking or inverting layers.
 * Remaining components are placed in order of their original minimum row (ascending), centered horizontally ((n - width)//2), and shifted downward (dy +=1) if they overlap with already placed content; horizontal shifts (dx adjustments) are a fallback but often lead to misalignment if overused.
 * 2's are neutral/empty in isolation but get absorbed into adjacent non-2 components; standalone 2's or unabsorbed 2's may need separate handling, but the program assumes they attach only during flood fill.
 * Overlap detection must check if target cell is occupied by a different value (out[nr][nc] != 0 and != val), allowing same-color overlaps but preventing conflicts; however, vertical packing can be tight, sometimes allowing row overlaps if shapes interlock.
 * Grid size is fixed (e.g., 22x22 for train1, 26x26? for test), with lots of leading/trailing 0's, implying the output should be sparse and centered overall.
 * Subtle: After placing special components, remove them from the list to avoid re-placement; sorting by original min row ensures stable ordering, but dy resets and dx shifts can cause cascading misplacements if the initial dy=0 assumption fails early.
 * Potential for shape distortion: When placing, relative positions are preserved (nr = start_r + (r - min_r_comp)), but if components have irregular shapes (e.g., with holes or protrusions), centering based on min/max col may clip or misalign protrusions.
 * 0's are background/empty; output must fill only where components are placed, leaving rest as 0.
 * Puzzle may involve "inverting" or "reflecting" the grid's vertical structure, as bottom-touching goes to top in output, suggesting a flow or stacking mechanic like in a physics simulation or layer puzzle.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def flood(start_i: int, start_j: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    component = []
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        if visited[i][j] or g[i][j] != c:
            continue
        visited[i][j] = True
        component.append((i, j, c))
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == c:
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```
(This flood fill is useful for extracting core same-color components accurately.)

```python
def add_adjacent_twos(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    adj_twos = set()
    for i, j, _ in component:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and g[ni][nj] == 2 and (ni, nj) not in adj_twos:
                adj_twos.add((ni, nj))
                component.append((ni, nj, 2))
    return component
```
(This attaches 2's correctly to components, which is key for shape integrity, but note it only adds once per component and doesn't recurse for chained 2's.)

```python
def place_component(comp: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], start_r: int, out: List[List[int]], n: int):
    if not comp:
        return
    min_r_comp = min(r for r, _, _ in comp)
    min_c = min(c for _, c, _ in comp)
    max_c = max(c for _, c, _ in comp)
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    target_left = (n - w) // 2
    dx = target_left - min_c
    h = max(r for r, _, _ in comp) - min_r_comp + 1
    for r, c, val in comp:
        nr = start_r + (r - min_r_comp)
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:
            out[nr][nc] = val
```
(This placement logic with relative offsets and centering is helpful but needs better overlap avoidance integration.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly implements flood fill for components and attachment of adjacent 2's, which preserves blob shapes including connectors, and identifies top/bottom-touching components accurately.
 * It worked partially for horizontal centering (target_left = (n - w)//2) and relative positioning within components, as seen in the generated outputs where blobs maintain their internal structure (e.g., 8's shapes in train1).
 * However, placement of special components (bottom at row 4, top at row 7) is too rigid and doesn't adapt to grid size or other components, leading to overlaps or gaps; in train1, bottom_comp (likely the 1's or 4's) is placed too low, causing the 8's to appear in row 8 instead of row 7 as expected.
 * Remaining components sorting by min_r is good, but the overlap avoidance loop (dy +=1, reset if too low, then dx +=1) is flawed—it doesn't check full height (h) before placing, causes infinite-like shifts in dense cases, and doesn't try multiple dy/dx combinations efficiently, resulting in misplacements like the 3's and 5's in train1 being scattered (e.g., 3's in row 4 expected but generated in row 18-20).
 * In train1, generated output has 8's correctly shaped but shifted right and down (rows 8-10 vs expected 7-9), 1's fragmented (row 12-18 with extras), and bottom elements like 4's/3's inverted wrong (generated row 17-20 vs expected row 4/18); specifically, expected has 3's blob at top (row4-5) which generated misses entirely in that position, and 5's/1's interlocking at bottom which generated flattens.
 * In train2, generated places 6's correctly at top but without adjacent 8's integration (expected merges 6's and 8's starting row5), 3's/1's/4's jumbled mid-grid (e.g., generated row13 has 4's/1's mixed wrong vs expected row8-13 with clean 1's bar and 3's), and bottom 8's missing (generated has them low but detached); unknown why 2's bridges fail to connect 8's properly here.
 * Removal of special components after placement works (avoids duplicates), but the fallback dx shift after dy overflow is unhelpful as it often pushes components off-center without resolving vertical packing, leading to empty rows (e.g., rows 0-6 empty in train2 generated vs expected starting row4).
 * The add_adjacent_twos function is helpful but limited— it adds 2's only to the initial component without recursing if 2's connect multiple blobs, potentially missing chained attachments; not broken but incomplete for complex 2-networks.
 * Overall, the program understands component extraction (helpful for blob isolation) but fails on packing logic, with no training example passing due to poor overlap handling and fixed start rows (4 and 7) that don't scale (e.g., train1 22x22 vs train2 similar but different densities).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (26x26 grid) does not look correct, as it places components in a scattered, non-stacked manner: e.g., small 8's/2's at top (rows1-3) but isolated, large 8's/9's/4's mid-grid (rows8-16) with awkward 2's intrusions, and bottom 1's/3's/7's (rows20-25) not centered or packed tightly, leaving huge empty spaces (rows3-7 empty).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: no clear inversion of edge-touchers (e.g., likely bottom 7's blob should be high up like train1's 3's, but generated low at row21-22), 2's are over-absorbed (e.g., row15 has 2's splitting 9's/4's unnaturally vs expected clean merges), and overall vertical stacking is broken with overlaps ignored (e.g., row13 9's/2's overlap potential but forced).
 * Components like the large 7's bar at row21 seem detached from 3's above, unlike training where bottom-touchers invert to top; the right-side placements (e.g., 7's cols21-26) are off-center, suggesting dx shift failed without proper width calc for irregular shapes.
 * 9's blob (rows12-16) is centered but shifted down too far, blocking potential top placements for edge components; unknown why 1's are in a thin vertical bar (rows17-20) instead of a wide base like expected interlocking in trains.
 * Empty rows and fragmented 2's (e.g., row0 all 0's, row23-25 sparse) indicate incomplete packing—test likely needs tighter vertical flow starting from row0 or4, but generated wastes space, making it look like a failed stacking rather than a solved puzzle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual rearrangement puzzle where the input grid contains connected components (blobs or shapes) of numbered cells (1-9, excluding 2's which act as connectors or extensions), and the goal is to extract these components, optionally augment them with adjacent or implied 2's based on touching top/bottom edges, order them by specific criteria (e.g., bottom-touching, top-touching, centroid height), and place them into a new empty grid in a stacked, centered manner with collision avoidance and horizontal shifts to form a coherent output image, likely representing a reorganized diagram or scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are found via flood fill for cells >0 and !=2, treating same-number adjacent (4-directional) cells as one object; 2's are not part of main components but can be attached if adjacent and below/above the main blob.
 * 2's above the minimum row of a main component (upper 2's) indicate "top touch" and may add an extra score or extension count, but are not included in the component itself; only unique upper 2's are counted.
 * Attached lower 2's (below or at min row) are flood-filled and added to the component if connected via 2's, extending the shape downward; this affects bottom-touch detection (if max row >= n-2).
 * For top-touching components, add "extra" 2's below the bottom row of the main component, in columns matching the bottom-most row's columns (up to the number of unique upper 2's), sorted by column to align left-to-right.
 * Ordering: Prioritize bottom-touching components first (take at most 1), then top-touching (at most 1), then remaining sorted by centroid row (lower centroid first?); if no top-touch, select the top-most (min min_r_main) as first.
 * Placement: Start at baseline row 4, center horizontally ((n - width)//2), use small horizontal shift (2) for top-touch components, larger (10) for others; for subsequent placements, search for lowest possible dy (tight packing above current max_r), preferring rightmost fitting dx within shift range to avoid overlaps; fallback to below current_max_r if no fit.
 * Subtleties: Components must be translated to relative coordinates from their collective min_r/min_c (including attached/extra 2's); overlaps are forbidden (out[nr][nc] must be 0); n=22 for all grids; 0's are empty; output must exactly match expected shapes/positions, including all 2's and numbers; missing or extra cells (e.g., unplaced components or wrong augmentations) cause failure.
 * Easy to miss: Upper 2's only count if strictly above min_r_main and adjacent; extra 2's for top-touch are placed exactly one row below the main's bottom, only in bottom-row columns (limited by upper_count); centroid is average row of main_comp only (ignores attached 2's); bottom-touch uses extended max_r with attached but not extra; if multiple bottom/top, only first is prioritized (unspecified tiebreaker); empty components skipped; all_cells_abs may be empty but fallback to main mins.
 * General: Preserve original values (e.g., 3's stay 3); no rotation/scaling; grid is square (22x22); puzzle likely assembles a larger scene (e.g., figures, bars, bases) where order creates narrative (bottom foundations, top elements, fillers).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single submission shown) correctly identifies and floods main components excluding 2's, augments with lower attached 2's via separate flood, and adds extra 2's for top-touch based on upper count and bottom columns.
 * Train 1: Generated output places 3's,5's,1's,8's,2's in wrong positions/rows (e.g., 3's high up with 5's adjacent but not matching expected stacked layout starting at row 4 with 3's/2's/8's/2's then lower 4/1/5 groups); misses many components (no 4's at all, wrong 1's shape, extra/missing 2's); 8's and 2's partially match but shifted; overall too sparse and high-placed, ignoring expected tight low packing.
 * Train 1: Bottom-touch detection likely wrong (e.g., 5's or 1's should extend with 2's to touch bottom?); ordering fails (starts with wrong first component, centroids not sorting fillers correctly); placement search prefers wrong dy/dx (e.g., not tight enough, wrong shift for top-touch).
 * Train 2: Generated output places 8's and 6's high, then 4's/2's mid, but misses most components (no 1's,3's at all; sparse 4's without extensions); expected has interleaved 6/8/2/1/3/4/2's in a complex mid-low stack; attachment of 2's to 4's wrong (shows isolated 2's); ordering ignores top/bottom touches (6's top-touch? 4's bottom?).
 * Train 2: Placement fallback too early (leaves bottom empty); shift logic pushes things right but not enough to fit all; rel_comp min_r_all incorrect for augmented shapes.
 * General issues: Only processes non-2 >0, but may skip implied components; upper_count over/under-counts if non-adjacent; extra 2's placed but not flood-connected; order takes [:1] for multiples but may pick wrong one; search for best_dy prefers low but not always tight (inf fallback too high); no handling for wide components overflowing center+shift.
 * Function `flood` is helpful and correct for isolation.
 * Function `process_component` is mostly helpful but buggy in attached 2's stack init (sets visited early, may miss some); extra_abs logic good but num=min(upper,len(bottom)) may under-add.
 * Function `place` is helpful and correct.
 * Overall program in `program` has good structure (components list, ordering, placement loop) but fails on integration (wrong order/positions lead to missing elements, overlaps not detected properly in search).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places a 3-blob (possibly top-touch with extras?) high up (rows 0-3) adjacent to a 9-blob, then 8's mid (rows 4-8) with isolated 2 below, leaving most of the grid empty below row 8; this is too top-heavy and sparse, missing likely lower components (e.g., no 1's,4's,5's,6's,7's visible, assuming test has more numbers).
 * Expected likely mirrors training: A stacked layout starting low (baseline ~4) with bottom-touch bases (e.g., extended 9's or 8's touching near row 20), then mid fillers, top elements with 2's connectors; current output ignores tight packing (huge empty space below), wrong ordering (3's and 9's first but not bottom-touch), and incomplete extraction (only 2-3 components placed, others dropped?); 3's shape augmented wrong (extra 3's? but shows connected); 8's missing parts (incomplete flood?); no horizontal alignment/collision avoidance working (9's overhang right).
 * To handle test: Ensure all components extracted/placed (e.g., if test has more blobs like train1/2); adjust ordering to prioritize true bottom-touch (with attached max_r); increase shift range or change dx preference (min abs instead of max?); verify 2's attachment includes all connected even non-adjacent starts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (blobs) of colored numbers (non-2 values) from an input grid, augmenting them with attached 2's (likely representing connectors or fillers) under specific rules (e.g., only lower attachments, conditional extras based on upper 2's and edge touches), normalizing their relative shapes, ordering them by properties like centroid and special flags (bottom-touching or top-edge-touching), and then packing them into a new output grid with prioritized placement (e.g., bottom components low, top high, others packed with shifts to avoid conflicts while allowing overlaps of same values).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected groups of the same non-2 positive value using 4-directional flood fill; 2's are ignored for main components but can be attached or added conditionally.
 * For each component: Compute min/max rows/cols; count unique upper 2's (above min row) and check if they touch row 0 (top edge); flood-fill attach only lower 2's (row >= min row, connected via 2's); compute centroid (average row of main cells); flag bottom-touch if max row (including attached) >= n-2; if top-edge-touch, add extra 2's below the main bottom in up to upper_count columns (sorted, starting from leftmost bottom cols).
 * Normalize to relative coords (shift to (0,0) min); combine main + attached + extras into rel_comp.
 * Ordering: Identify unique bottom-touch (highest centroid) and top-edge-touch (lowest centroid) components first; remove them; sort remaining by descending centroid (higher rows first, i.e., "bottom-up" placement?); place bottom at fixed dy=4, top at current_max_r+1, others starting from max(4, current_max_r - allowance=4) with vertical increments and horizontal center/right shifts (up to 10) if center conflicts.
 * Placement allows overwriting with same value or empty (0), but rejects different values; track current_max_r for stacking; out-of-bounds cells are skipped.
 * Subtleties: Upper 2's are just counted/set for conditions but not attached to rel_comp; extra 2's only if top-edge-touch and placed exactly one row below main bottom in specific cols; bottom flag uses max_r including attached; components with no cells skipped; n=22 for train1/2, 26 for test; overlaps must preserve values exactly (no mixing different numbers).
 * Potential misses: Flood fill might over/under-connect if 2's bridge mains incorrectly (but code excludes 2's from main); extra 2's col selection uses sorted bottom cols, limited by min(upper_count, bottom_cols); placement shifts only right from center, no left; fixed dy=4 for bottom might be too low/high; allowance=4 for packing start might cause overlaps or gaps; centroid is row-only (ignores cols); multiple bottom/top picks highest/lowest centroid if ties.
 * All attempts must handle empty rows/cols in output; preserve exact shapes/colors; no rotation/flipping; 0's are background.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies and extracts main components via flood fill (helpful for isolating blobs like the 8's, 3's, etc.), computes centroids and relative shapes, and attempts ordered packing with conflict checks and shifts.
 * What worked: Component extraction seems accurate (e.g., groups 8's together, 3's, 4's); relative normalization shifts to (0,0); placement logic avoids hard conflicts by allowing same-val overlaps; tracks current_max_r for stacking.
 * What didn't work: Both training examples are incorrect, with major misplacements and missing/incorrect 2 attachments. In Train 1: Generated places 8's high (row1-3) but expected lower (row7-9); 3's fragmented/misattached (row4-5 with wrong 2's/5's overlap); 4's low but shifted wrong (includes extra 3's/1's); 1's and 5's scattered/missing connections; no top/bottom specials seem applied correctly (e.g., expected bottom 1's/5's low, but generated has them mid). Differences: Generated has 8's too high, 2's attached to wrong blobs (e.g., under 8's but expected under 3's/4's), 5's partial; unknown why extras/attachments flood wrong (perhaps lower 2's overconnect across components).
 * In Train 2: Generated packs 8's/6's/1's/3's/4's high/mid but ignores many connections/2's; e.g., 6's partial (missing full shape), 3's right but no attachments, 4's absent/low; expected has 6's top, 8's mid with 2's, 1's/3's/4's lower with 2's bridging. Differences: Generated misses lower packing (all crammed rows4-8, empty below); no 2's placed at all; components like 4's/1's fragmented or omitted; unknown why top/bottom flags failed (e.g., expected bottom 4's/3's low).
 * process_component likely buggy: Attached 2's might flood too broadly (connecting unrelated 2's); extras added wrong cols/rows (e.g., Train1 generated extras under 8's but expected elsewhere); bottom dy=4 too rigid (causes overlaps); shifts only right, no left/center retry; allowance=4 too small, causes vertical gaps/overlaps.
 * get_all_processed and main program helpful for orchestration but fail on ordering (e.g., bottom/top not prioritized correctly, leading to high placement of low-centroid items).
 * No unhelpful functions; all aim at puzzle but execution errs (e.g., flood is solid, but integration with 2's handling broken).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears jumbled and incomplete, with components partially placed but misaligned, missing connections, and no coherent packing (e.g., 8's scattered across rows1-10 without full shape, 9's fragmented in rows8-11, 7's/4's clumped mid but overlapping wrong like 3's into 2's area, 1's trailing low/right but disconnected; many empty rows below despite space). Expected likely a stacked arrangement: top-edge items high (e.g., perhaps 8's or 9's up with upper 2's implied), bottom-touch low (e.g., 1's/4's at bottom with attached 2's), others packed mid by descending centroid, with 2's bridging/filling per rules (e.g., extras under top-touch if row0 2's present). Differences: No 2's placed systematically (only sparse, e.g., row5 col15); shapes distorted (e.g., 8's not contiguous full blob); right-side crowding (7's/4's/1's shifted far); ignores potential bottom flag for low 1's; overall lacks vertical spacing/stacking, looks like failed shift/packing (e.g., dy starts too low, shifts push off-center without resolving conflicts). Unknown why 3's/9's partial, but clearly doesn't match expected clean, rule-based rearrangement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of connected components (blobs or shapes) from an input grid, where each component consists of cells with the same positive integer value (representing distinct objects or colors), followed by normalizing their relative shapes, sorting them based on their original positions in the input (likely by row centroid to preserve top-to-bottom order), and reassembling them into a new output grid by placing them without overlap in a specific order and position (e.g., packing from the top-left available space, but potentially starting from a baseline row or in sorted order to match expected layouts with leading zero rows).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components must be connected orthogonally (4 directions: up, down, left, right) and only cells with the *exact same value* (>0) should be grouped together—do not merge different values, even if adjacent, as this creates invalid oversized or hybrid shapes.
 * Normalize shapes relative to the minimum row and column in each component to get a "bounding box" origin at (0,0), preserving the internal structure and values.
 * Compute a centroid (e.g., average row position) for sorting; sort components by *increasing* centroid row (top-first in original grid) rather than decreasing, as the current decreasing sort (bottom-first) leads to reversed order in output.
 * Placement must avoid overlaps: when placing a shape, check that target cells are empty (0) or match the value (though ideally empty since shapes are distinct); try positions starting from top-left (smallest row, then smallest column) within bounds, but the expected outputs have leading zero rows (e.g., rows 0-3 empty in train1), suggesting shapes are packed starting from a specific baseline (e.g., row 4) or only after sorting and fitting without forcing top placement.
 * Output grid is same size as input (n x n), initialized to zeros; all original shapes must be placed exactly, without rotation, scaling, or modification, and unused areas remain 0.
 * Subtle: Components may have irregular shapes (e.g., spaced cells like "E" or "H" forms in expected), holes aren't mentioned but shouldn't affect connectivity; ensure no out-of-bounds placement; if a shape can't fit in a "preferred" spot, fallback to bottom-left may overwrite or misplace, but expecteds suggest all fit cleanly when ordered correctly.
 * Grids seem square (e.g., 22x22 for train1/2, possibly 26x26 for test based on line lengths); values are small positives (1-9), zeros are empty.
 * Potential for multiple components of same value? Treat as separate if not connected.
 * Ordering impacts placement: wrong sort leads to shapes appearing in incorrect vertical sequence (e.g., bottom shapes at top of output).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    # Current version connects any >0 cells (wrong: merges different values).
    # Helpful base, but modify to: in stack/visit, check g[nx][ny] == g[x][y] (same value).
    n = len(g)
    visited = set()
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] > 0 and (i, j) not in visited:
                val = g[i][j]  # Key: use this val for connectivity
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited.add((i, j))
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y, g[x][y]))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and g[nx][ny] == val and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                            visited.add((nx, ny))
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```

```python
def get_rel_shape(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # Helpful: normalizes to (0,0) origin, preserves values. No changes needed.
    if not component:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, _, _ in component)
    min_c = min(c for _, c, _ in component)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c, v) for r, c, v in component]
```

```python
def get_centroid(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> float:
    # Helpful for sorting by original position (average row). But sort by increasing (not -x[0]).
    if not component:
        return 0.0
    total_r = sum(r for r, _, _ in component)
    return total_r / len(component)
```

```python
def get_dimensions(rel_shape: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Helpful: computes height/width for placement bounds. No changes needed.
    if not rel_shape:
        return 0, 0
    max_r = max(r for r, _, _ in rel_shape)
    max_c = max(c for _, c, _ in rel_shape)
    return max_r + 1, max_c + 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core issue: find_components merges adjacent cells of different values into single components (e.g., 3's connected to 2's), leading to distorted shapes that don't match expecteds (e.g., in train1 generated, hybrid 3-2-5-4-1 blobs at top; in train2, mixed 8-2-1-3-4-6; test has jumbled 3-2-7-9-4-1-8).
 * Sorting by decreasing centroid (-x[0]) places bottom-original shapes first/at top of output, but expecteds have top-original shapes higher (e.g., train1 expected starts with horizontal 3's at row4, likely a top shape; train2 expected has 6's at row4, then 8's/2's/1's/3's/4's lower—suggests increasing sort for top-first placement).
 * Placement loop starts from top (sr=0), filling immediately, causing no leading zero rows (e.g., train1 generated fills row0 with 3's/2's/5's; expecteds have rows 0-3 zero); fallback to bottom-left (sr=n-height) sometimes used but overwrites or mispositions when can't place (e.g., test generated has shapes crammed at top rows 0-8, ignoring potential baseline).
 * Overlap check is partially correct (avoids different values), but since components are wrong, it leads to partial placements or skips; expecteds have no overlaps and exact shape preservation (e.g., train1 expected has isolated "E"-like 8's, spaced 3's/2's, L-shaped 4's with 1's/2's/5's—no merging).
 * get_rel_shape, get_centroid, get_dimensions are helpful and correct for normalization/sizing/sorting.
 * Overall program structure (extract -> sort -> place sequentially) is a good skeleton, but broken by connectivity and sort/placement logic; no rotation or value changes attempted (correct, as expecteds preserve them).
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has dense top-packed hybrids (e.g., row0: 3's then 2/5's; row3: 8's/5's/4's/1's), expected has clean separate shapes lower (e.g., row4: 3's row; row5: spaced 3's; row7: 8's row; row12: 4's with attachments; unknown why baseline at row4, perhaps implicit padding or sort order).
 * Train2 mismatches: generated mixes at top (row0: 8's/2's/6's; row1: 8's/1's/3's/4's/6's), expected has separate lower (row4: 6's; row5: spaced 6's/8's; row8: spaced 2's/1's/3's; row13: 4's—reversed order effect).
 * Test output: Does not look correct—shapes are merged/hybrid (e.g., row0 starts with 3's/2's; row1 has 7's block with 4's/2's/1's/8's mixed; row5 has 8's block with 2's/9's), placed densely at top (rows 0-8 filled, rest zero), ignoring leading zeros and exact separations; expecteds suggest clean, separate components packed lower/mid-grid in original order (likely top-first), so this is invalid (e.g., 7/9 blocks should be isolated, not adjacent to 4's/1's unless same-value connected, which they're not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it's a messy top-packed grid with merged shapes (e.g., 3's adjacent to 2's in row0, 7's block bleeding into 4's/1's/8's in rows1-2), no leading zero rows, and incomplete lower placement (rows9+ all zero, suggesting failed placements or early stops); this mismatches expected patterns from training (clean, separate same-value blobs, starting after zero rows ~row4, in sorted order without hybrids).
 * Likely wrong due to same-value connectivity bug (merges distinct objects like 3-2, 7-4-1-8) and top-first placement without padding/baseline, causing overlap avoidance failures; to handle test, fix to same-value components, sort increasing centroid, and add baseline start (e.g., sr from 4) or pack only after all zeros above.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10.

[2025-10-02 01:54:35] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where connected components of non-2 values (representing "main" objects like blobs or shapes of numbers 1,3,4,5,6,8,9) must be extracted, augmented with adjacent or connected 2's (acting as attachments or extensions), ordered by specific rules involving centroids and touch flags, and then rearranged into a new output grid starting from row 4 (index 4), centered horizontally, with vertical stacking and minor shifts to avoid overlaps, while preserving relative shapes and handling special cases for top-touching (low row) and bottom-touching (high row) components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Main components are connected groups of the same positive integer (non-2, non-0) using 4-directional flood fill; ignore 0's (empty) and 2's (special connectors) during extraction.
 * 2's are not main components but must be attached if they form connected groups (via other 2's) that touch any cell of a main component; this expands the component shape without changing the main value.
 * For top-touching components (those with attached 2's above the minimum row of the main part), add extra virtual 2's below the main component's bottom row, matching the number of upper 2's (up to the width of the bottom row's columns), placed in sorted column order; this seems to "balance" or extend the shape downward for placement rules.
 * Compute properties like relative normalized shape (shifted to (0,0) origin), centroid (average row for vertical positioning/ordering), height/width of full shape (main + attached + extra 2's), and flags for top-touch (any 2 above min main row) and bottom-touch (full shape reaches near grid bottom, e.g., max row >= n-2).
 * Ordering: Prioritize the single bottom-touch component with the highest (deepest) centroid first; then non-touch components by increasing centroid; finally the single top-touch component with the lowest (shallowest) centroid last; this creates a specific sequence like bottom-heavy -> middle -> top-light.
 * Placement starts at row 4 (0-indexed), centered horizontally ((n - w)//2); try tight vertical packing below the current max occupied row, then scan downward from row 4 with small horizontal shifts (±1 to ±5) if conflicts (defined as placing over non-empty non-matching value); fallback to bottom of grid if unplaceable; overlaps allow same-value or empty (0), but not different values.
 * Grid size is square (n x n), outputs are n x n with 0's elsewhere; subtle: components may span irregularly, 2's can connect diagonally? No, 4-directional only; extra 2's are virtual (not from input) and only for top-touch balancing; ignore isolated 2's or 0's entirely.
 * Easy to miss: Centroid is row-only (vertical bias for ordering); relative shape includes all parts (main, attached, extra); placement skips out-of-bounds cells; bottom-touch flag uses full shape max row vs. grid bottom; ordering assumes at most one bottom/top per category (code picks max/min if multiple).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle varying grid sizes (22x22 in training, 26x26 in test?); components can be sparse/irregular (e.g., not solid blocks); 2's might form bridges or extensions that change effective height/width/centroid; ensure no overwriting of different values during placement; top-touch extra 2's use bottom row's columns (sorted) for positioning, limiting to min(upper_count, bottom_width).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly implements component extraction via flood fill and 2-attachment via seed flooding, which identifies main shapes and extensions accurately (e.g., groups 5's together, attaches nearby 2's).
 * Ordering by bottom-touch (highest centroid) first, then ascending centroid, top-touch (lowest) last works conceptually but fails in practice due to miscomputed centroids or flags, leading to wrong sequence (e.g., in Train 1, 8's placed low but expected higher; 5's/1's misplaced).
 * Placement logic starting at row 4 with centering and shifts avoids some overlaps but generates incorrect layouts: in Train 1, generated has 5's/3's/1's jammed in row 4-5 with scattered 2's/8's below, but expected spreads 3's/8's higher (rows 4-7), adds 4's/1's/5's lower (rows 11-17) in different shapes; unknown why 5's appear extended incorrectly or 4's missing entirely.
 * In Train 2, generated places 6's/8's/4's compactly in rows 4-7 with some 2's, but expected separates 6's higher (rows 4-7), interleaves 8's/1's/3's/4's lower (rows 8-13) with more precise 2-placements; misses isolating certain components or wrong attachment (e.g., extra 2's not added for top-touch 6's?).
 * compute_component_properties adds extra 2's for top-touch but may over/under-count upper_set or misplace extras (e.g., Train 1 generated has no extras visible, but expected has balanced shapes like extended 1's/5's).
 * can_place/do_place handle conflicts by allowing same-value/0 but not others, which is correct, but fallback to bottom causes overcrowding; tight dy_try often fails due to h/w miscalc from irregular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant (flood/extract/attach/properties/placement); none are broken per se, but properties dict may have centroid bug (uses full cells including 2's/extras, but perhaps should weight main only? unknown).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places a 9-shape (likely main 9's with attached 2's) in rows 4-8 centered-leftish, an irregular 3/2 mix below it in row 7-8 overlapping slightly, and a wide 8-shape with trailing 2's in rows 9-13, but this seems too compact and left-biased compared to training expectations of more vertical spread starting row 4, centered, with distinct stacking (e.g., expected might separate 9's high, 3's mid, 8's low with balanced extras/attachments).
 * Missing potential top-touch handling: the 9's have 2's above/inline (row 6-7), suggesting top-touch, so extras should add 2's below, but generated lacks visible downward extension; 8's at bottom may be bottom-touch but not prioritized first.
 * 2's are scattered (e.g., row 5 col15, row12 col14), possibly from attachments, but don't form expected bridges or balances; overall, layout ignores ordering subtlety (e.g., if 8's are bottom-touch, they should place first/lowest, but here they're mid-low); unknown if grid size (26x26?) affects centering ((26-w)//2), leading to left shift.
 * Does not make sense as correct: Unlike expected training outputs' clean, separated shapes (e.g., Train 1's distinct 3/8/4/1/5 blocks), test generated has overlapping/jumbled 3/2/8 areas (rows 7-8), suggesting failed can_place shifts or wrong relative_comp normalization.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 01:58:24] Response:
- **Main Shapes and Red Attachments**: Each non-yellow main shape (Blue U-tetromino, Maroon/Purple inverted L-tetromino, Green L-triomino, Orange/Pink backward L-triomino) is interconnected with 2-4 specific Red monominoes (or small red polyominoes, e.g., dominoes) positioned at edges, corners, tips, or extensions. These reds are adjacent or overlapping the main shape's bounding box in the input and remain relatively positioned in the output after translation. This attachment is consistent across both train examples and defines shape-specific features (e.g., corner accents on Blue U, tips on L-shapes, side extensions on Yellow). Yellow square tetromino is similarly attached to 2-4 reds (including possible dominoes) that remain fixed.

- **Rigid Translation Interaction**: Position of a non-yellow main shape in the input effects a uniform translation (delta x, delta y) of the shape and its attached reds to a new position in the output. This preserves relative positions of attachments to the shape, pixel counts, bounding box dimensions (adjusted by translation), and holes (=0). Yellow's position and attachments do not translate (delta x=0, delta y=0). Consistent in both train examples; specific translation amounts vary but the rigid preservation does not.

- **Red Merging on Coincidence**: When translated positions of attached reds from multiple main shapes coincide (same [x,y]), they merge into a single Red monomino (pixels=1) or extended red polyomino (e.g., domino pixels=2) at that location in the output. This reduces total red components and is observed in both train examples (e.g., multiple shapes' tip reds merge at shared y-levels like y=6 or y=7; some merge onto Yellow's fixed reds).

- **Unattached Reds Isolation**: Red monominoes not adjacent to or within/near any main shape's bounding box in the input (e.g., isolated or midway between shapes) do not appear in the output and show no interaction with translations or merges. Consistent in both train examples; they are irrelevant to component transformations.

- **Color and Shape Property Preservation**: Color of each main shape effects no change in the output (e.g., Blue remains Blue, pixels=11-15). Shape properties (pixels, holes=0, silhouette via bbox) are preserved post-translation, indicating no interaction altering intrinsic form. Consistent across all main shapes in both train examples.

- **Position-to-Position Influence (Unknown Details)**: Absolute positions of main shapes in the input effect the choice of translation deltas in the output, leading to clustering around the fixed Yellow. Relative positions of attachments are preserved, but the rule for selecting deltas (e.g., why dx=+8, dy=+9 for Blue in train 1) is unknown and not explainable from provided data without forcing inconsistencies.

- **No Cross-Color Interactions**: No evidence of one main shape's color or properties directly effecting another's form or color; interactions are mediated only via red attachments and their merges. Consistent (no changes observed). 

- **Irrelevant Elements**: Purple straight dominoes, Blue straight tetrominoes, and Light Blue/Dark Red variants appear in test inputs but not trains; no consistent interactions identifiable across all provided data, so excluded. Scattered reds without attachments are isolated (no effect on movement).

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- **Main Shapes and Red Attachments**: Each non-yellow main shape (Blue U-tetromino, Maroon/Purple inverted L-tetromino, Green L-triomino, Orange/Pink backward L-triomino) is interconnected with 2-4 specific Red monominoes (or small red polyominoes, e.g., dominoes) positioned at edges, corners, tips, or extensions. These reds are adjacent or overlapping the main shape's bounding box in the input and remain relatively positioned in the output after translation. This attachment is consistent across both train examples and defines shape-specific features (e.g., corner accents on Blue U, tips on L-shapes, side extensions on Yellow). Yellow square tetromino is similarly attached to 2-4 reds (including possible dominoes) that remain fixed.

- **Rigid Translation Interaction**: Position of a non-yellow main shape in the input effects a uniform translation (delta x, delta y) of the shape and its attached reds to a new position in the output. This preserves relative positions of attachments to the shape, pixel counts, bounding box dimensions (adjusted by translation), and holes (=0). Yellow's position and attachments do not translate (delta x=0, delta y=0). Consistent in both train examples; specific translation amounts vary but the rigid preservation does not.

- **Red Merging on Coincidence**: When translated positions of attached reds from multiple main shapes coincide (same [x,y]), they merge into a single Red monomino (pixels=1) or extended red polyomino (e.g., domino pixels=2) at that location in the output. This reduces total red components and is observed in both train examples (e.g., multiple shapes' tip reds merge at shared y-levels like y=6 or y=7; some merge onto Yellow's fixed reds).

- **Unattached Reds Isolation**: Red monominoes not adjacent to or within/near any main shape's bounding box in the input (e.g., isolated or midway between shapes) do not appear in the output and show no interaction with translations or merges. Consistent in both train examples; they are irrelevant to component transformations.

- **Color and Shape Property Preservation**: Color of each main shape effects no change in the output (e.g., Blue remains Blue, pixels=11-15). Shape properties (pixels, holes=0, silhouette via bbox) are preserved post-translation, indicating no interaction altering intrinsic form. Consistent across all main shapes in both train examples.

- **Position-to-Position Influence (Unknown Details)**: Absolute positions of main shapes in the input effect the choice of translation deltas in the output, leading to clustering around the fixed Yellow. Relative positions of attachments are preserved, but the rule for selecting deltas (e.g., why dx=+8, dy=+9 for Blue in train 1) is unknown and not explainable from provided data without forcing inconsistencies.

- **No Cross-Color Interactions**: No evidence of one main shape's color or properties directly effecting another's form or color; interactions are mediated only via red attachments and their merges. Consistent (no changes observed). 

- **Irrelevant Elements**: Purple straight dominoes, Blue straight tetrominoes, and Light Blue/Dark Red variants appear in test inputs but not trains; no consistent interactions identifiable across all provided data, so excluded. Scattered reds without attachments are isolated (no effect on movement).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:20:17] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual assembly puzzle where colored polyomino-like components (excluding empty space 0 and red attachments 2) must be extracted from an input grid, repositioned on a new blank grid with the yellow component (color 4) anchored vertically at the grid's middle row (n//2), and other components attached or positioned relative to it using red dots as docking ports, prioritizing multi-point alignments before fallback rules for singles or unattached pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected groups of the same non-zero, non-red color; isolated cells count as components even if size 1.
 * Red cells (2) adjacent to exactly one component are "attached" to that component and move with it; reds adjacent to multiple or none are ignored for attachment.
 * Yellow (4) is always placed first, shifted only vertically to center its top row at n//2, with no horizontal shift (dc_y=0); its attached reds are placed as 2s.
 * Attachment prioritizes greedy placement: for shapes with reds, test all possible shifts (dr, dc) relative to existing placed reds, favoring shifts that match >=2 reds (or >=1 if the shape has only 1 red); among ties, prefer minimal Manhattan distance; only attempt shapes with at least one red.
 * Unplaced shapes after greedy phase use fallbacks: no-red shapes align top-left to yellow's position; single-red shapes dock to nearest existing red; multi-red shapes (assumed "B-type" if exactly 2 reds on the bottom row) try to align their bottom-left red pair to the leftmost row with >=2 reds (using the rightmost red in that row for horizontal offset, plus yellow's width); otherwise, default to yellow-aligned positioning.
 * All placements must stay within grid bounds [0,n-1]; out-of-bounds parts are clipped (not placed).
 * Output is a new grid with placed components and their attached reds (as 2s); unattachable or default-placed items still go on the grid but may overlap or misalign if rules fail.
 * Subtlety: Component bounding boxes (minr/maxr/minc/maxc) are used for default positioning but not for attachment—attachment is purely red-to-red matching.
 * Subtlety: When placing, shape cells overwrite output (no overlap checks); reds are added as 2s only if in bounds, and placed reds accumulate for future attachments.
 * Easy to miss: Yellow's width (y_width) is used in B-type horizontal offset to "append" right of yellow; candidate merge rows are only those with >=2 reds already placed.
 * Easy to miss: Greedy loop only considers shapes with reds; no-red shapes are always deferred to fallback.
 * Consideration: Grid size n is odd/even agnostic but centering assumes integer n//2; test inputs may have n=22 or 26 (even), affecting exact centering.
 * Consideration: Colors like 1,3,6,7,8,9 represent distinct shapes; no rotation/reflection—preserve input orientation and relative positions.
 * Consideration: If no yellow, output empty grid; if components empty, also empty.
 * Across attempts: Red attachment detection must use 4 directions only (no diagonals); stack-based flood fill for components to handle irregular shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple, Set

def find_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict]:
    # Flood-fill to extract connected components of same color (non-0, non-2), including singles.
    # Returns list of dicts with 'color', 'cells' (list of (r,c)), and bounding box 'minr','maxr','minc','maxc'.
    # Uses DFS stack and visited matrix; 4-directional adjacency.
    # Helpful: Correctly identifies all components, including small/irregular ones; bounding box aids default positioning.
```

```python
def find_attached_reds(grid: List[List[int]], components: List[Dict]) -> None:
    # For each red (2), check 4-adjacent cells; if exactly one adjacent component, attach that red's position to the component's 'reds' list.
    # Uses cell_to_comp mapping for quick lookup; modifies components in place.
    # Helpful: Essential for identifying movable ports; ignores reds touching multiple/no components (stationary or free).
```

```python
def place_shape(output: List[List[int]], shape: Dict, dr: int, dc: int, n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Shifts shape's cells by (dr,dc), places color in output if in bounds; separately collects new red positions (but doesn't place them—caller does).
    # Returns list of shifted red positions.
    # Helpful: Core placement logic; clips out-of-bounds; separates cells from reds for flexible handling.
    # Note: In usage, caller then places reds as 2s and adds to placed_reds set.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully: All components correctly extracted, yellow centered, attachments via reds worked (multi/single matches), fallbacks unused or correct—output matched expected.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated output mostly matched expected (yellow at row 4-5-ish, most shapes like 1,3,4,8 placed correctly with reds), but the 6-shape (likely a vertical piece with reds) was misplaced— in generated, row 5 has 6 at col7, then 8s starting col9 (overlapping/merged visually), row 6 has 6 at col7 then 8 at col10; expected has separate 6s at col7-9 in rows 5-6, with 8s shifted right starting col13. Effect: 6 appears attached to 8-block instead of independent/docked separately; unknown why—possibly greedy attachment favored 6 to existing 8-reds over correct single/distance, or fallback miscomputed dr/dc for 6's reds. Reds in row7 (2s at col7,9,12,15) placed correctly in both.
 * Greedy attachment loop worked partially: Successfully placed some multi-red shapes (e.g., 8-block docked), but over-prioritized or miscalculated shifts for 6, leading to partial overlap/misposition.
 * Fallback for multi-red (B-type) seemed unused or incorrect for 6 (if it had 2 bottom reds, didn't align to row with 2 reds properly).
 * find_components and find_attached_reds helpful and correct (components match input in both trains).
 * place_shape helpful but in train2, when placing 6, it overwrote or shifted into 8's space without clip handling the intent.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided are relevant, though the B-type fallback logic (port_row detection, merge_row candidates) may be buggy for non-exact-2-reds-on-bottom cases like 6.
 * extract_objects not present but implied in components—essential for shape isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (n=26) partially makes sense but likely incorrect overall: Yellow (4) correctly centered vertically around rows 14-17 (n//2=13, but placed starting row12 with vertical shift); components like 9 (top-right, rows7-10), 8 (rows11-13, docked via reds), 1 (rows13-16 left), 7 (row18 bottom-left), 3 (row19) extracted/placed visibly. Reds accumulated and used for docking (e.g., 2s in row12 col6/10, row17 col5/10). However, it doesn't look fully correct—e.g., the large 8 in row10 cols9-16 seems shifted left into where reds are, potentially overlapping unplaced space; bottom 2s in row20 cols6/10 undocked; shape 9's reds in row8 col14/18 not aligning to any existing 2s perfectly (single-red fallback?); overall layout spreads left-heavy, but puzzle likely expects tighter right-append via yellow width in B-type or better greedy multi-matches (e.g., if input has B-shapes with 2 bottom reds, they should align to rows like 12 with 2+ reds, offsetting by yellow's width ~6-7 cols). Missing: Potential clipping of out-of-bounds (e.g., input 9 at cols14-18 shifted to 14-18 ok, but 8's extent might clip); no empty rows at top/bottom as in trains, but input has them—output preserves spacing poorly. Effect: Shapes present but positions misaligned (e.g., 8/9 too close, 7/3 undocked left instead of appended); differs from train2 error pattern (mis-dock) but similar (greedy/fallback bug). To handle test, update greedy to better prioritize non-overlapping shifts or refine B-type to check all multi-red configs beyond just bottom-2.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 02:20:26] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (as complete puzzle examples), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** train puzzle (both train 1 and train 2) and maintain the same relational behavior in their respective inputs and outputs. I focused solely on direct, observable links (e.g., adjacency, shared edges, or property dependencies) without inferring higher-level rules, semantics, or transformations. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone reds far from other components, black background as mere void) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., Orange only in train 1, Pink only in train 2, or variable pixel counts like Maroon's 9 vs. 6) are not linked here unless the interaction itself is uniform across both. Test inputs were scanned for structural consistency but not used to define interactions, as they lack outputs for verification.

No forced connections: Where a potential link (e.g., exact color-to-position causation) cannot be directly tied consistently, it is noted as unknown rather than explained.

1. **Red single-pixel elements (bbox size 1x1, pixels=1) → Adjacent positioning to non-red colored components (Blue, Yellow, Green, Maroon)**:  
   Red pixels consistently appear directly adjacent (sharing x or y coordinates, often at bbox edges) to Blue, Yellow, Green, and Maroon components in all inputs and outputs. This suggests red as connection points or accents. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input/output: Reds at [8,4], [8,7], [2,5] adjacent to Blue [2,3,7,8] and Yellow [9,11,11,13].  
   - Train 2 input/output: Reds at [2,12], [4,12], [6,15], [9,12] adjacent to Blue [2,13,6,17] and Yellow [10,11,12,13].  
   The adjacency holds regardless of component movement, with reds shifting to maintain edge contact.

2. **Yellow component (color=Yellow, holes=0, pixels=9, central bbox ~[9-11,11-13]) ↔ Red single-pixel elements**:  
   Yellow is consistently surrounded by or extended via multiple red single pixels at its bbox boundaries (top, bottom, sides), forming "extensions" or "accents." This interaction is fixed and identical in inputs/outputs of both trains. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input/output: Yellow [9,11,11,13] linked to reds at [9,10], [11,10], [12,12], [10,14], [8,7].  
   - Train 2 input/output: Yellow [10,11,12,13] linked to reds at [9,12], [11,10-12,10], [13,12], [12,20? wait no, direct adjacents like [9,12], [13,12]].  
   Yellow's position and properties remain unchanged, while reds adjust slightly but preserve the extension pattern. No other non-red component shows this fixed multi-red linkage consistently.

3. **Blue component (color=Blue, holes=0, pixels=11-15, open frame-like bbox) → Red single-pixel elements at frame edges**:  
   Blue consistently has red pixels at or near its bbox corners/edges (e.g., offset by 1 unit in x/y), indicating accent or outline reinforcement. Pixel count and holes=0 preserved; only position shifts. This edge interaction is uniform in both trains. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Blue [2,3,7,8] p=15 with reds at [2,5], [8,4], [8,7]. Output: Blue [10,12,15,17] p=15 with reds at [10,14? adjacent via [12,12], [16,13]].  
   - Train 2 input: Blue [2,13,6,17] p=11 with reds at [2,12], [4,12], [6,15]. Output: Blue [7,8,11,12] p=11 with reds at [7,7], [9,7], [11,10].  
   Reds reposition to track Blue's movement, maintaining edge proximity.

4. **Green component (color=Green, holes=0, L-shape or base bbox, pixels=7-10) → Red single-pixel elements at base/ends**:  
   Green consistently connects to red pixels at its lower or side edges (y-coordinates matching or adjacent to Green's bbox min_y or sides), suggesting endpoint links. Pixel count varies (7 in train 1, 10 in train 2) but edge interaction is fixed; position shifts but holes=0 preserved. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Green [1,18,5,19] p=7 with reds at [1,20], [5,20] (below base). Output: Green [8,4,12,5] p=7 with reds at [8,6], [12,6] (below base).  
   - Train 2 input: Green [16,11,19,15] p=10 with reds at [16,10], [19,10], [17,15] (sides/base). Output: Green [12,8,15,12] p=10 with reds at [12,7], [15,7] (below/sides).  
   Reds follow Green's base position changes.

5. **Maroon component (color=Maroon, holes=0, bar/stack-like bbox, pixels=6-9) → Red single-pixel elements above/below**:  
   Maroon consistently has red pixels positioned immediately above or below its bbox (matching x-range, offset y by 1), indicating vertical stacking or connector links. Pixel count varies (9 in train 1, 6 in train 2) but vertical red interaction is uniform; position shifts but holes=0 preserved. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Maroon [15,1,19,3] p=9 with reds at [15,0], [19,0] (above). Output: Maroon [8,7,12,9] p=9 with reds at [9,10], [11,10] (below, via [8,6? adjacent]).  
   - Train 2 input: Maroon [9,18,12,19] p=6 with reds at [9,20], [12,20] (below). Output: Maroon [12,5,15,6] p=6 with reds at [12,7], [15,7] (below).  
   Reds adjust y to stay vertical-aligned with Maroon's movement.

6. **Non-red colored components (Yellow, Blue, Green, Maroon) → Position-dependent red repositioning**:  
   When non-red components shift bbox positions between input and output, nearby red single pixels consistently relocate to maintain adjacency (e.g., x/y offsets of 0-2 units), preserving connection without changing red properties (color, pixels=1, holes=0). This dependency is observed in all shifting components across both trains. Unknown: Exact positional transformation rule (e.g., why Blue moves right in both).

7. **All non-red components (Blue, Yellow, Green, Maroon) → Preservation of intrinsic properties despite position changes**:  
   Color, holes=0, and pixel count remain identical for each component type between input and output, while bbox position changes (except Yellow, which is fixed). This self-consistency enables interactions with reds to adapt without altering component identity. Applies to all in both trains.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., direct color-to-color links like Blue → Green are absent or inconsistent; Orange/Pink/Light Blue/Dark Red in tests don't appear in both trains for verification; no hole interactions as all are 0; no color changes observed). Black background has no active connections, only spatial separation.

[2025-10-02 02:21:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (as complete puzzle examples), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** train puzzle (both train 1 and train 2) and maintain the same relational behavior in their respective inputs and outputs. I focused solely on direct, observable links (e.g., adjacency, shared edges, or property dependencies) without inferring higher-level rules, semantics, or transformations. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone reds far from other components, black background as mere void) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., Orange only in train 1, Pink only in train 2, or variable pixel counts like Maroon's 9 vs. 6) are not linked here unless the interaction itself is uniform across both. Test inputs were scanned for structural consistency but not used to define interactions, as they lack outputs for verification.

No forced connections: Where a potential link (e.g., exact color-to-position causation) cannot be directly tied consistently, it is noted as unknown rather than explained.

1. **Red single-pixel elements (bbox size 1x1, pixels=1) → Adjacent positioning to non-red colored components (Blue, Yellow, Green, Maroon)**:  
   Red pixels consistently appear directly adjacent (sharing x or y coordinates, often at bbox edges) to Blue, Yellow, Green, and Maroon components in all inputs and outputs. This suggests red as connection points or accents. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input/output: Reds at [8,4], [8,7], [2,5] adjacent to Blue [2,3,7,8] and Yellow [9,11,11,13].  
   - Train 2 input/output: Reds at [2,12], [4,12], [6,15], [9,12] adjacent to Blue [2,13,6,17] and Yellow [10,11,12,13].  
   The adjacency holds regardless of component movement, with reds shifting to maintain edge contact.

2. **Yellow component (color=Yellow, holes=0, pixels=9, central bbox ~[9-11,11-13]) ↔ Red single-pixel elements**:  
   Yellow is consistently surrounded by or extended via multiple red single pixels at its bbox boundaries (top, bottom, sides), forming "extensions" or "accents." This interaction is fixed and identical in inputs/outputs of both trains. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input/output: Yellow [9,11,11,13] linked to reds at [9,10], [11,10], [12,12], [10,14], [8,7].  
   - Train 2 input/output: Yellow [10,11,12,13] linked to reds at [9,12], [11,10-12,10], [13,12], [12,20? wait no, direct adjacents like [9,12], [13,12]].  
   Yellow's position and properties remain unchanged, while reds adjust slightly but preserve the extension pattern. No other non-red component shows this fixed multi-red linkage consistently.

3. **Blue component (color=Blue, holes=0, pixels=11-15, open frame-like bbox) → Red single-pixel elements at frame edges**:  
   Blue consistently has red pixels at or near its bbox corners/edges (e.g., offset by 1 unit in x/y), indicating accent or outline reinforcement. Pixel count and holes=0 preserved; only position shifts. This edge interaction is uniform in both trains. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Blue [2,3,7,8] p=15 with reds at [2,5], [8,4], [8,7]. Output: Blue [10,12,15,17] p=15 with reds at [10,14? adjacent via [12,12], [16,13]].  
   - Train 2 input: Blue [2,13,6,17] p=11 with reds at [2,12], [4,12], [6,15]. Output: Blue [7,8,11,12] p=11 with reds at [7,7], [9,7], [11,10].  
   Reds reposition to track Blue's movement, maintaining edge proximity.

4. **Green component (color=Green, holes=0, L-shape or base bbox, pixels=7-10) → Red single-pixel elements at base/ends**:  
   Green consistently connects to red pixels at its lower or side edges (y-coordinates matching or adjacent to Green's bbox min_y or sides), suggesting endpoint links. Pixel count varies (7 in train 1, 10 in train 2) but edge interaction is fixed; position shifts but holes=0 preserved. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Green [1,18,5,19] p=7 with reds at [1,20], [5,20] (below base). Output: Green [8,4,12,5] p=7 with reds at [8,6], [12,6] (below base).  
   - Train 2 input: Green [16,11,19,15] p=10 with reds at [16,10], [19,10], [17,15] (sides/base). Output: Green [12,8,15,12] p=10 with reds at [12,7], [15,7] (below/sides).  
   Reds follow Green's base position changes.

5. **Maroon component (color=Maroon, holes=0, bar/stack-like bbox, pixels=6-9) → Red single-pixel elements above/below**:  
   Maroon consistently has red pixels positioned immediately above or below its bbox (matching x-range, offset y by 1), indicating vertical stacking or connector links. Pixel count varies (9 in train 1, 6 in train 2) but vertical red interaction is uniform; position shifts but holes=0 preserved. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Maroon [15,1,19,3] p=9 with reds at [15,0], [19,0] (above). Output: Maroon [8,7,12,9] p=9 with reds at [9,10], [11,10] (below, via [8,6? adjacent]).  
   - Train 2 input: Maroon [9,18,12,19] p=6 with reds at [9,20], [12,20] (below). Output: Maroon [12,5,15,6] p=6 with reds at [12,7], [15,7] (below).  
   Reds adjust y to stay vertical-aligned with Maroon's movement.

6. **Non-red colored components (Yellow, Blue, Green, Maroon) → Position-dependent red repositioning**:  
   When non-red components shift bbox positions between input and output, nearby red single pixels consistently relocate to maintain adjacency (e.g., x/y offsets of 0-2 units), preserving connection without changing red properties (color, pixels=1, holes=0). This dependency is observed in all shifting components across both trains. Unknown: Exact positional transformation rule (e.g., why Blue moves right in both).

7. **All non-red components (Blue, Yellow, Green, Maroon) → Preservation of intrinsic properties despite position changes**:  
   Color, holes=0, and pixel count remain identical for each component type between input and output, while bbox position changes (except Yellow, which is fixed). This self-consistency enables interactions with reds to adapt without altering component identity. Applies to all in both trains.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., direct color-to-color links like Blue → Green are absent or inconsistent; Orange/Pink/Light Blue/Dark Red in tests don't appear in both trains for verification; no hole interactions as all are 0; no color changes observed). Black background has no active connections, only spatial separation.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:43:36] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual assembly puzzle where the input grid contains disconnected colored components (non-red pixels representing puzzle pieces) and red pixels (acting as connectors or attachment points). The goal is to identify these components, determine valid attachment points via reds, and reassemble them into a coherent structure (e.g., a train-like vehicle) by translating and placing them relative to a central "yellow" (color 4) base piece, using rules for vertical stacking above, side attachments on left/right, and horizontal chaining to the right.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected groups of the same non-red color; reds (color 2) are not part of components but serve as exclusive attachment points— a red is "attached" to a component only if all its non-red neighbors belong to that single component (no sharing across components).
 * Yellow (color 4) is the mandatory base; if absent, output an empty grid. Place it first at its original position, then attach others relative to it.
 * Vertical attachments (above yellow or in chains): Require a "top bar" on the lower piece (a full contiguous row of pixels at its top, without gaps) and "bottom two reds" on the upper piece (exactly two reds at the bottom row, separated by a distance that the lower bar can "span" — bar length >= distance between reds +1). Chains are built by recursively stacking pieces that can attach this way, preferring longer chains or better spans (minimal overhang).
 * Side attachments (left/right of yellow's second row): Use chains with a single "side bottom red" at the bottom row (left side: red at column 0 of bottom; right side: red at max column of bottom). For left chain, attach via its right-side red to yellow's left edge (column min_c -1) at row min_r +1; for right chain, attach via left-side red to yellow's right edge (max_c +1). Sort chains by color ascending to assign lowest color to left, next to right.
 * Horizontal attachments (right of yellow): Chain remaining pieces sequentially, attaching via top bar to the previous piece's right edge (often at a "bottom" level like row +1 per step, or using right-side reds if present at top row for level continuation; if no right red at top, drop to next row). In examples, this often involves single-red or no-red attachments, and may include reds placed but not always used for spanning.
 * Subtleties: Reds are placed in output but don't connect visually— they indicate attachment validity. Attachments must align exactly (no rotation, only translation). Chains should be maximal/non-overlapping, built bottom-up. In examples, not all pieces attach (e.g., some remain unplaced if no valid connector). Yellow's second row is key for side/horizontal starts, even without reds there. Overlaps are forbidden (new_grid starts empty, placements overwrite 0 only). Grids are 22x22 in examples, but general. Bugs like unpacking None (e.g., missing top_bar or bottom_two_red) cause crashes— always check for None before unpacking.
 * Edge cases: Components with no valid bars/reds can't attach. Multiple chains possible, but select best (longest, closest span). Horizontal may zigzag rows (e.g., +1 row per piece if no level-holding red). Colors are unique per component in examples, but sort by color for ordering. Unattached pieces (e.g., isolated) stay unplaced.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
from collections import deque

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
Basic 4-connected neighbor finder; essential for BFS and attachment checks.

```python
def find_connected_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, Set[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    components = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and (i, j) not in visited:
                color = grid[i][j]
                component: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited.add((i, j))
                component.add((i, j))
                while queue:
                    cr, cc = queue.popleft()
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if grid[nr][nc] == color and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                            visited.add((nr, nc))
                            queue.append((nr, nc))
                            component.add((nr, nc))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```
Core function to extract components by color using BFS; works well, ignores reds correctly.

```python
def get_attached_reds(grid: List[List[int]], comp_pos: Set[Tuple[int, int]], all_nonred_pos: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    candidate_reds = set()
    for r, c in comp_pos:
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(r, c, rows, cols):
            if grid[nr][nc] == 2:
                candidate_reds.add((nr, nc))
    attached = set()
    for r, c in candidate_reds:
        only_this = True
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(r, c, rows, cols):
            if (nr, nc) in all_nonred_pos and (nr, nc) not in comp_pos:
                only_this = False
                break
        if only_this:
            attached.add((r, c))
    return attached
```
Correctly finds exclusive reds attached to one component; crucial for connectors, handles sharing prevention.

```python
def get_component_bbox(comp: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, c in comp]
    cs = [c for r, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
Simple bounding box; useful for translation calculations.

```python
def get_top_bar(comp: Set[Tuple[int, int]], min_c: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    min_r, max_r, _, max_c = get_component_bbox(comp)
    top_row_cs = set(c - min_c for r, c in comp if r == min_r)
    if top_row_cs:
        min_top = min(top_row_cs)
        max_top = max(top_row_cs)
        length = max_top - min_top + 1
        if length == len(top_row_cs):  # No gaps
            return min_top, max_top, length
    return None
```
Detects gap-free top row for spanning; helpful but assumes relative to min_c—works for vertical attachments.

```python
def get_bottom_two_red(reds: Set[Tuple[int, int]], comp_min_r: int, comp_min_c: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    bottom_rel_r = -1  # Adjust to actual max_r +1 if needed
    max_r = max(r for r, c in reds)
    bottom_reds = [(r - comp_min_r, c - comp_min_c) for r, c in reds if r == max_r]
    if len(bottom_reds) == 2:
        rc1, rc2 = sorted(bottom_reds, key=lambda x: x[1])
        dist = rc2[1] - rc1[1]
        return max_r - comp_min_r, rc1[1], rc2[1], dist
    return None
```
Identifies exactly two bottom reds for vertical ports; key for stacking, but buggy (uses -1 rel_r, assumes max_r is bottom).

```python
def can_span(dist: int, bar_length: int) -> bool:
    return bar_length >= dist + 1
```
Simple span check; correct and essential for vertical validation.

```python
def translate_set(pos: Set[Tuple[int, int]], dr: int, dc: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {(r + dr, c + dc) for r, c in pos}

def place_pixels(grid: List[List[int]], pos: Set[Tuple[int, int]], color: int):
    for r, c in pos:
        if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]):
            grid[r][c] = color
```
Basic translation and placement; bounds-checked, useful but doesn't handle overlaps (assumes no conflicts).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt; component extraction (find_connected_components, get_attached_reds) works correctly in identifying pieces and exclusive reds, as seen in partial placements matching input positions before translation.
 * Vertical chain building (build_vertical_chains, can_attach_upper) conceptually grasps stacking via bars and two-red bottoms but fails in recursion (recurse function builds all subsets, not just valid chains; no filtering for disjoint/maximal). In train1, no upper chain attached (yellow top_bar detected but no matching chain), leading to missing 8 and 3 above. In train2, partial vertical (6 placed wrong).
 * Side attachments partially work: In train1, detected side reds but placement logic flips left/right (uses right red for left chain, but target_c = min_c -1 misaligns; 5 placed but at wrong row/col, and 3 not as side). In train2, no sides detected/placed.
 * Horizontal chaining fails: In train1, places 3 and 1 wrong (3 under yellow instead of right; 1 fragmented and row-dropped incorrectly, missing full bar at bottom). In train2, places 1 and 3 horizontally but misaligned (1 not full row, 3 shifted left). Update current_attach_row/col logic doesn't handle "drop +1 row per piece without top red" properly, and right_red_rel check assumes bottom but needs top-level for continuation.
 * get_side_bottom_red is broken/not helpful: Hardcodes bottom_rel_r = h-1 but filters for side cols only; returns None often if red not exactly at bottom (e.g., train1 right red for horizontal is at row+1, not bottom). Doesn't generalize to any row for horizontal.
 * get_bottom_two_red buggy: rel_r hardcoded -1, uses actual max_r from reds (assumes reds define bottom, but comp bbox needed); unpacking fails if None, causing test error.
 * build_vertical_chains recurse includes self-loops (i == current_bottom_idx skip insufficient) and doesn't enforce position disjointness, leading to overlapping/invalid chains.
 * Yellow handling good (placed correctly), but second_row assumes +1 without checking structure; in train1, horizontal starts at yellow_max_c but ignores if yellow has right red (train1 has none, but expected attaches without).
 * Overall, placements start from original positions then translate wrong (dr/dc calcs use rel ports but ignore full bbox shifts); no overlap checks. Train1 generated has yellow/reds partial, 8/3/1/5 misplaced or fragmented (e.g., 3 at wrong height, 1 not contiguous bar, 5 shifted right with extra 2). Train2 has 6/8/1/3/5 wrong (6 left of yellow instead of above/right mix, 8 not attached, 1/3 horizontal but row-misaligned, 5 missing). Differences unknown for some (e.g., why 3 in train1 at row12 col12-16 instead of expected row17 col10-14 bar).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error ("cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object"), likely from unpacking None in get_top_bar or get_bottom_two_red/get_side_bottom_red during chain building or placement (e.g., a component lacks required bar/reds, causing None unpack in for-loops like bottom_port = get_bottom_two_red(...); if bottom_port: _,_,_,dist = bottom_port).
 * This does not look correct— the program crashes instead of producing a valid grid, indicating unhandled cases (e.g., test may have components without top bars or single reds, breaking assumptions). Expected output unknown without test input grid, but error suggests missing None-checks (e.g., if not bottom_port: continue) and better error handling for attachments. To handle test, add guards around unpacking (e.g., if bottom_port and len(bottom_port)==4: ... ) and skip invalid chains/pieces.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 02:44:05] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two training examples (input/output pairs), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** example (both Train 1 and Train 2), focusing only on components with clear, repeated effects on each other (e.g., via position, adjacency, or transformation). I ignored isolated elements (e.g., scattered Reds with no adjacent polyominoes), inconsistent ones (e.g., Orange appears only in Train 1; Pink only in Train 2), and irrelevant details (e.g., black background; total pixel counts without shape ties; holes=0 for all, which is uniform but non-interactive). No high-level interpretations or solutions are included. Where a transformation (e.g., exact movement rule) cannot be explained from the data without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

- **Red single-pixel trims (horizontal/vertical segments) connect vertically to Green L-shaped polyominoes and Maroon H/I-shaped structures**: In both outputs, 1-2 Red pixels are placed directly adjacent (y-offset of 1) below Green (Train 1: Reds at y=6 under Green at y=4-5; Train 2: Reds at y=7 under adjacent Green at y=8-12, with similar vertical alignment to Maroon). This affects positioning by stacking Green and Maroon closer together vertically compared to inputs (where they are scattered). Horizontal Reds do not show this consistent vertical stacking effect.
  
- **Red single-pixel trims connect horizontally to Blue U/C-shaped polyominoes and Maroon H/I-shaped structures**: In both outputs, isolated Red pixels align horizontally (x-overlap or adjacency) with the open ends or sides of Blue (Train 1: Reds at x=10/12/16 near Blue bbox x=10-15; Train 2: Reds at x=7/9/12/15 framing Blue bbox x=7-11 and Maroon x=12-15). This causes Blue and Maroon to cluster horizontally in outputs (bbox overlap or edge-touching), unlike scattered inputs. Effect on movement: pulls them into integrated rows.

- **Blue U/C-shaped polyominoes positionally interact with Yellow T/square-shaped polyominoes (adjacency affecting clustering)**: In both outputs, Blue bbox overlaps or abuts Yellow bbox on the side (Train 1: Blue x=10-15 y=12-17 adjacent to Yellow x=9-11 y=11-13; Train 2: Blue x=7-11 y=8-12 left-adjacent to Yellow x=10-12 y=11-13). Pixel count preserved (11-15 for Blue; 9 for Yellow), but input positions (scattered) transform to output adjacency. Unknown: exact rotation or offset rule (e.g., Blue always opens toward Yellow? Not verifiable consistently).

- **Green L-shaped polyominoes positionally interact with Blue U/C-shaped polyominoes (horizontal adjacency affecting alignment)**: In both outputs, Green bbox abuts Blue on the right/left horizontally (Train 1: Green x=8-12 y=4-5 near later Blue x=10-15; Train 2: Green x=12-15 y=8-12 directly right of Blue x=7-11 y=8-12). This causes shared y-range alignment in outputs (overlapping rows), pulling Green from distant input positions. Pixel count preserved (7-10 for Green). Effect: forms extended horizontal structures.

- **Maroon H/I-shaped structures' vertical position affects Red trim placement and Green L-shape stacking**: In both outputs, Maroon's y-midpoint (e.g., y=7-9 in Train 1; y=5-6 in Train 2) determines Red trim y-placement immediately above/below, which in turn stacks Green above or below Maroon (Train 1: Maroon y=7-9 stacks under Green via Reds y=6; Train 2: Maroon y=5-6 aligns horizontally with Pink/Green equivalents via Reds y=7). Pixel count preserved (6-9 for Maroon). Unknown: how input bbox height (always 2-3 units) precisely dictates output stacking offset.

- **Yellow T/square-shaped polyominoes' position influences adjacent Blue/Green clustering (central alignment effect)**: In both outputs, Yellow acts as a "pivot" with bbox centered horizontally relative to Blue and Green (Train 1: Yellow x=9-11 between Green x=8-12 and Blue x=10-15; Train 2: Yellow x=10-12 between Blue x=7-11 and Green x=12-15). This transforms input scattered positions into output where Blue/Green bbox edges touch or overlap Yellow's. Pixel count preserved (9 for Yellow). No color change, but affects overall row integration.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable hole count effects, as all=0; no consistent color-to-color transformations like Green -> Blue; no diagonal or distant position effects across examples). Test inputs show similar components (e.g., Blue/Yellow/Green/Maroon with Reds), but cannot confirm interactions without outputs.

[2025-10-02 02:46:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two training examples (input/output pairs), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** example (both Train 1 and Train 2), focusing only on components with clear, repeated effects on each other (e.g., via position, adjacency, or transformation). I ignored isolated elements (e.g., scattered Reds with no adjacent polyominoes), inconsistent ones (e.g., Orange appears only in Train 1; Pink only in Train 2), and irrelevant details (e.g., black background; total pixel counts without shape ties; holes=0 for all, which is uniform but non-interactive). No high-level interpretations or solutions are included. Where a transformation (e.g., exact movement rule) cannot be explained from the data without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

- **Red single-pixel trims (horizontal/vertical segments) connect vertically to Green L-shaped polyominoes and Maroon H/I-shaped structures**: In both outputs, 1-2 Red pixels are placed directly adjacent (y-offset of 1) below Green (Train 1: Reds at y=6 under Green at y=4-5; Train 2: Reds at y=7 under adjacent Green at y=8-12, with similar vertical alignment to Maroon). This affects positioning by stacking Green and Maroon closer together vertically compared to inputs (where they are scattered). Horizontal Reds do not show this consistent vertical stacking effect.
  
- **Red single-pixel trims connect horizontally to Blue U/C-shaped polyominoes and Maroon H/I-shaped structures**: In both outputs, isolated Red pixels align horizontally (x-overlap or adjacency) with the open ends or sides of Blue (Train 1: Reds at x=10/12/16 near Blue bbox x=10-15; Train 2: Reds at x=7/9/12/15 framing Blue bbox x=7-11 and Maroon x=12-15). This causes Blue and Maroon to cluster horizontally in outputs (bbox overlap or edge-touching), unlike scattered inputs. Effect on movement: pulls them into integrated rows.

- **Blue U/C-shaped polyominoes positionally interact with Yellow T/square-shaped polyominoes (adjacency affecting clustering)**: In both outputs, Blue bbox overlaps or abuts Yellow bbox on the side (Train 1: Blue x=10-15 y=12-17 adjacent to Yellow x=9-11 y=11-13; Train 2: Blue x=7-11 y=8-12 left-adjacent to Yellow x=10-12 y=11-13). Pixel count preserved (11-15 for Blue; 9 for Yellow), but input positions (scattered) transform to output adjacency. Unknown: exact rotation or offset rule (e.g., Blue always opens toward Yellow? Not verifiable consistently).

- **Green L-shaped polyominoes positionally interact with Blue U/C-shaped polyominoes (horizontal adjacency affecting alignment)**: In both outputs, Green bbox abuts Blue on the right/left horizontally (Train 1: Green x=8-12 y=4-5 near later Blue x=10-15; Train 2: Green x=12-15 y=8-12 directly right of Blue x=7-11 y=8-12). This causes shared y-range alignment in outputs (overlapping rows), pulling Green from distant input positions. Pixel count preserved (7-10 for Green). Effect: forms extended horizontal structures.

- **Maroon H/I-shaped structures' vertical position affects Red trim placement and Green L-shape stacking**: In both outputs, Maroon's y-midpoint (e.g., y=7-9 in Train 1; y=5-6 in Train 2) determines Red trim y-placement immediately above/below, which in turn stacks Green above or below Maroon (Train 1: Maroon y=7-9 stacks under Green via Reds y=6; Train 2: Maroon y=5-6 aligns horizontally with Pink/Green equivalents via Reds y=7). Pixel count preserved (6-9 for Maroon). Unknown: how input bbox height (always 2-3 units) precisely dictates output stacking offset.

- **Yellow T/square-shaped polyominoes' position influences adjacent Blue/Green clustering (central alignment effect)**: In both outputs, Yellow acts as a "pivot" with bbox centered horizontally relative to Blue and Green (Train 1: Yellow x=9-11 between Green x=8-12 and Blue x=10-15; Train 2: Yellow x=10-12 between Blue x=7-11 and Green x=12-15). This transforms input scattered positions into output where Blue/Green bbox edges touch or overlap Yellow's. Pixel count preserved (9 for Yellow). No color change, but affects overall row integration.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable hole count effects, as all=0; no consistent color-to-color transformations like Green -> Blue; no diagonal or distant position effects across examples). Test inputs show similar components (e.g., Blue/Yellow/Green/Maroon with Reds), but cannot confirm interactions without outputs.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 03:02:22] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction and rearrangement of colored connected components (blobs) from an input grid into a structured output grid, resembling a "train" or modular vehicle layout with vertical or horizontal configurations, connected by red (2) trim elements, and specific alignments for colors like green (3), maroon (8), blue (1), yellow (4), and pink (6). The output preserves the relative shapes of input blobs but repositions them with rules for adjacency, trims, and stacking, while leaving most of the grid as 0s and avoiding overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Configurations depend on color presence: vertical stacking (e.g., green on top, then maroon, red trims below) if no pink (6); horizontal layout (e.g., pink first, then side-by-side blue/yellow/green) if pink present—mismatching this leads to wrong starting positions and overlaps.
 * Red (2) acts as connectors/trims: vertical trims below blob bottoms (using leg positions from bottom row DCs), horizontal trims adjacent to sides (e.g., left of blue); but avoid over-adding reds in non-connection spots, as this fills empty areas incorrectly.
 * Extract and place blobs relatively: Use min_r/min_c offsets to normalize shapes, then place at fixed starts (e.g., green at r=4,c=8; blue at c=10; yellow at c=9); preserve exact sparsity/holes in blobs (e.g., don't fill greens or maroons solidly).
 * Alignments and abutments: Blue abuts yellow horizontally (as pivot), green abuts blue rightward; maroon often below or right-shifted; extras (e.g., orange=5) stacked rightward vertically; subtle overlaps allowed in some configs (e.g., maroon start_r = red_r +1).
 * Height calculations: Use max dr +1 for stacking next components below (e.g., red at h_green, maroon at red_r+1); approximate gaps (+1 or +3) for spacing, but avoid hardcoding if shapes vary.
 * Extra colors: Place remaining colors (beyond 1,2,3,4,8) stacked vertically on right (c=17), but only if present; don't invent or misplace like 7/9 in test.
 * Subtle omissions: Top 4 rows always 0s; no distortion of input shapes (e.g., green in ex1 is sparse with holes, not solid); connections only at specific points (e.g., blue-maroon bbox adjacents); handle empty positions gracefully (early return if no pos).
 * Across attempts: Fixed starts (e.g., current_y=4) work for top placement but fail if shapes taller; simplistic red additions (loop over r,c=[12,16,...]) pollute grid; reuse of rules (e.g., rule_cluster_blue_yellow calling others) causes duplication/misplacement; vertical vs horizontal mode helps but buggy (e.g., yellow below in horizontal mode overlaps).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_positions(g: List[List[int]], color: int, size: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(r, c) for r in range(size) for c in range(size) if g[r][c] == color]
```
(Extracts all positions of a color—essential for identifying blobs.)

```python
def extract_relative(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if not pos:
        return 0, 0, []
    min_r = min(r for r, c in pos)
    min_c = min(c for r, c in pos)
    rel = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in pos]
    return min_r, min_c, rel
```
(Normalizes blob to (0,0) origin—key for preserving shape when placing.)

```python
def place_component(output: List[List[int]], rel: List[Tuple[int, int]], color: int, start_r: int, start_c: int, size: int):
    for dr, dc in rel:
        if 0 <= start_r + dr < size and 0 <= start_c + dc < size:
            output[start_r + dr][start_c + dc] = color
```
(Places a normalized blob at a start position, bounds-checked—core for non-overlapping insertion.)

```python
def add_red_trims_vertical(output: List[List[int]], leg_positions: List[int], start_r: int, start_c: int, size: int):
    for dc in leg_positions:
        if 0 <= start_r < size and 0 <= start_c + dc < size:
            output[start_r][start_c + dc] = 2
```
(Adds vertical red trim below a blob's bottom legs—useful but limited to vertical; needs horizontal counterpart.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Mode detection (if 6 in colors) correctly branches to horizontal (pink-led) vs vertical (green-led), but execution fails: in ex1 (no pink, vertical), green/maroon/red stack roughly aligns but green is solid-filled (ignores input sparsity), extra reds at c=16/17 pollute right side, blue/yellow placed too low/right with wrong shapes (e.g., yellow at r=11-13,c=10-11 overlaps red), orange(5) misplaced low-right.
 * In ex2 (pink present, horizontal), pink places okay but with extra reds below/immediately, maroon shifts wrong (to c=12 but overlaps pink reds), blue/green/yellow cluster misaligned (e.g., blue at c=10 but with wrong rel shape, green at c=13 but sparse input not preserved), yellow below pink at +3 gap but overlaps, tons of extra reds from final loop fill lower grid uselessly.
 * What worked: Blob extraction/placement basics (shapes mostly preserved in size, colors correct); vertical trim logic identifies bottom legs accurately; extra color stacking attempts right-side vertical.
 * What didn't: Over-adds reds (e.g., horizontal simplistic in rule_horizontal_blue_maroon_red only at fixed [start_y][start_c-1], but misses full bbox; final loop adds irrelevant reds at fixed c=[9,10,12,13,16]); ignores input blob sparsity (e.g., ex1 green row4 solid 3s vs expected sparse; ex2 maroon row5-6 has 2s inside); wrong starts/gaps (e.g., ex1 maroon at r=7,c=8 but expected r=7,c=8 sparse; ex2 yellow not clustered properly); no horizontal trim function (reuses vertical wrongly); place_pink_horizontal buggy (red_r_m = max(...) but leg_dcs_m uses wrong bottom_dr).
 * rule_pivot_yellow_blue_green and rule_align_green_blue help chain placements but cause overlaps/duplication when called in wrong order/mode.
 * add_red_trims_vertical is helpful for vertical but broken for horizontal (needs dc/r swap); place_extra_color good for extras but starts at fixed c=17, stacks with +1 gap (may overlap if tall).
 * Overall, program understands component extraction but fails on precise positioning, sparsity, and targeted reds—leads to cluttered, mismatched outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows a messy vertical stack starting at r=4 with green(3) partially sparse but with extra 2s inside (e.g., row5 c=9-10=2, expected clean), maroon(8) at r=9-12 but fragmented/wrong rel (e.g., row10 c=8=8 but then 2s/0s), yellow(4)/blue(1) at r=14-16 mixed with 1s/2s but shapes distorted (e.g., row15 c=11=1 inside yellow?), extras like 7 (r=17 c=17-22 solid, possibly orange-like but wrong color/placement) and 9 (r=19-25 scattered low-right, wrong shape/position). Massive red pollution (2s at every connection and beyond, e.g., columns 16-17 filled vertically, row8-9 full 2-trim). Differs from expected pattern (based on trainings): Should have clean top-4 0s, sparse blobs, targeted reds only at bottoms/sides (e.g., no internal 2s, no invented 7/9 positions), right-side extras stacked without overlap, horizontal elements if pink (but test seems vertical-mode). Likely mode wrong or extraction failed for test input's colors/shapes; doesn't match training expectations of structured train without filler.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 03:03:14] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Consistent Interactions and Connections

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (Train 1 and Train 2), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interconnections between components and properties. These are limited to patterns that appear identically in **every** train example (both inputs and their corresponding outputs). I focused solely on elements with clear, repeated interactions or effects (e.g., positional adjacency, preservation under transformation, or direct association via proximity). Irrelevant elements (e.g., black background, isolated properties like holes=0 which never vary or interact) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or speculation on overall mechanics is included. Where a transformation or effect cannot be explained consistently (e.g., exact movement rules), it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Colored Shapes (Non-Red Blobs) and Pixel Count Preservation**
   - **Interaction**: Pixel count (pixels property) of each non-Red colored shape (e.g., Blue, Green, Maroon, Yellow, Orange, Pink) directly determines its identity and remains invariant, affecting its translation as a rigid unit.
   - **Consistency**: In every train input and output, shapes with matching pixel counts (e.g., Yellow always p=9; Blue p=15 in Train 1, p=11 in Train 2) preserve this value exactly, ensuring no deformation or splitting. This property "locks" the shape's integrity during position changes.
   - **Effect**: Pixel count constrains movement—shapes move as whole units without pixel loss/gain, interacting with position updates.

#### 2. **Colored Shapes (Non-Red Blobs) and Bounding Box Dimensions**
   - **Interaction**: Bounding box dimensions (width = x2 - x1 + 1; height = y2 - y1 + 1) of non-Red shapes are preserved, linking shape geometry to translation.
   - **Consistency**: Every non-Red shape in both trains maintains identical width and height across input to output (e.g., Train 1 Blue: 6x6; Train 2 Green: 4x5; Maroon in Train 1: 5x3; all unchanged). This geometric property "effects" movement by enforcing rigid translation without rotation or resizing.
   - **Effect**: Dimensions interact with position (bbox coordinates) to define how the shape relocates—new positions reuse the same size, ensuring adjacency potential with other elements.

#### 3. **Non-Red Colored Shapes and Translation (Position -> Position)**
   - **Interaction**: The position (bbox coordinates) of non-Red shapes (except Yellow) consistently transforms via translation, where initial position affects final position in a way that brings shapes closer or adjacent.
   - **Consistency**: In every train, all non-Red shapes except Yellow undergo pure translation (x/y offsets applied uniformly to bbox), preserving color, pixels, and dimensions (e.g., Train 1 Green moves from [1,18,5,19] to [8,4,12,5]; Train 2 Pink from [16,3,18,5] to [7,4,9,6]). Yellow's position is unaffected (stationary).
   - **Effect**: Initial position directly effects the output position, resulting in clustered configurations. Exact offset rule (e.g., how initial coords determine delta) is unknown and inconsistent in pattern across trains.

#### 4. **Yellow Shape and Stationary Position**
   - **Interaction**: The Yellow shape (always p=9, ~3x3 bbox) has no positional transformation, making its fixed location a "anchor" that interacts with surrounding elements' clustering.
   - **Consistency**: In every train input and output, Yellow remains at the exact same bbox (Train 1: [9,11,11,13]; Train 2: [10,11,12,13]), unaffected by translations of other shapes.
   - **Effect**: Its static position indirectly effects adjacency—other shapes translate toward or near it in outputs (e.g., in Train 1 output, Blue and Maroon position adjacent to Yellow's y=11-13 range; in Train 2, Blue/Green overlap its x-range).

#### 5. **Red Single Pixels (p=1) and Adjacency to Non-Red Shapes**
   - **Interaction**: Single-pixel Red elements (p=1, point-like at single [x,y]) consistently position adjacent to (or at edges of) non-Red shapes' bboxes, acting as connection markers.
   - **Consistency**: In every train input and output, Red p=1 blobs are placed immediately adjacent to non-Red shapes (e.g., within 1-2 units of bbox edges; Train 1 input: Reds at [2,5] near Blue [2,3,7,8]; output: Reds at [8,6]/[12,6] between Green and Maroon. Train 2 input: Reds at [16,6]/[18,6] below Pink; output: Reds at [7,7]/[9,7]/[12,7]/[15,7] below Pink/Maroon). No Red p=1 is isolated >2 units from any non-Red shape.
   - **Effect**: Red positions respond to non-Red bbox edges, "linking" shapes (e.g., Reds fill gaps between translated shapes in outputs). Color (Red) is tied to this role—non-Red shapes never have p=1.

#### 6. **Maroon/Dark Red Shapes and Horizontal Fill Interaction**
   - **Interaction**: Maroon (or similar dark red) shapes (low pixels, wide bbox) interact with nearby Red p=1 by aligning horizontally, where Red positions extend or cap their bbox.
   - **Consistency**: In every train, Maroon (p=9 in Train 1, p=6 in Train 2) has 1-2 Red p=1 directly adjacent horizontally or vertically at bbox edges post-translation (e.g., Train 1 output: Maroon [8,7,12,9] with Reds at [9,10]/[11,10] inside x-range; Train 2 output: Maroon [12,5,15,6] with Reds at [12,7]/[15,7] below). Pixels (~6-9) suggest partial fills that "connect" via Reds.
   - **Effect**: Maroon's wide bbox (e.g., 4-5 width, low height) effects Red placement for horizontal extension, consistently forming linear assemblies.

#### Unknowns (Consistent but Unexplainable Interactions)
- **Red Pixel Count and Shape Clustering**: Red p=1 count varies (e.g., ~10-15 per example) and increases/decreases slightly across input/output, but consistently correlates with the number of non-Red shapes (one Red per edge or joint). Exact generation rule (e.g., how non-Red positions spawn new Reds) is unknown—no consistent formula ties counts directly.
- **Color-Specific Translations**: Each color (e.g., Blue -> rightward in Train 1, downward in Train 2) translates differently relative to Yellow, but the direction/magnitude effect from initial position is inconsistent (e.g., no uniform vector). This interaction exists (color affects translation path) but cannot be explained without forcing patterns.
- **No Rotation or Deformation**: All non-Red shapes avoid rotation (bbox aspect ratio preserved), interacting with grid alignment, but why this constraint applies (vs. possible rotations) is unknown.

No other connections (e.g., holes, specific silhouettes, or color-to-color direct effects without position mediation) are consistent across every example. Elements like isolated Reds or non-interacting positions were excluded as irrelevant.

[2025-10-02 03:05:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent colors or blobs, and the task is to extract connected components (blobs of the same non-2 color, including adjacent 2's as connectors or wildcards) from an input grid and rearrange them into a new output grid by stacking them vertically from top to bottom with horizontal centering, while handling special cases for components touching the top or bottom edges and avoiding overlaps by shifting downward or horizontally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-directional (up, down, left, right) flood fill for cells of the same color (non-2), and must include all adjacent 2's (which act as bridges or attachments to the main blob, even if not same color).
 * Components touching the bottom edge (max row == n-1) should be placed higher up in the output (e.g., starting around row 4-5), while top-touching components (min row == 0) are placed lower (e.g., row 7-8), suggesting an inversion or "flipping" of edge-touching blobs to simulate a puzzle like stacking or inverting layers.
 * Remaining components are placed in order of their original minimum row (ascending), centered horizontally ((n - width)//2), and shifted downward (dy +=1) if they overlap with already placed content; horizontal shifts (dx adjustments) are a fallback but often lead to misalignment if overused.
 * 2's are neutral/empty in isolation but get absorbed into adjacent non-2 components; standalone 2's or unabsorbed 2's may need separate handling, but the program assumes they attach only during flood fill.
 * Overlap detection must check if target cell is occupied by a different value (out[nr][nc] != 0 and != val), allowing same-color overlaps but preventing conflicts; however, vertical packing can be tight, sometimes allowing row overlaps if shapes interlock.
 * Grid size is fixed (e.g., 22x22 for train1, 26x26? for test), with lots of leading/trailing 0's, implying the output should be sparse and centered overall.
 * Subtle: After placing special components, remove them from the list to avoid re-placement; sorting by original min row ensures stable ordering, but dy resets and dx shifts can cause cascading misplacements if the initial dy=0 assumption fails early.
 * Potential for shape distortion: When placing, relative positions are preserved (nr = start_r + (r - min_r_comp)), but if components have irregular shapes (e.g., with holes or protrusions), centering based on min/max col may clip or misalign protrusions.
 * 0's are background/empty; output must fill only where components are placed, leaving rest as 0.
 * Puzzle may involve "inverting" or "reflecting" the grid's vertical structure, as bottom-touching goes to top in output, suggesting a flow or stacking mechanic like in a physics simulation or layer puzzle.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def flood(start_i: int, start_j: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    component = []
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        if visited[i][j] or g[i][j] != c:
            continue
        visited[i][j] = True
        component.append((i, j, c))
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == c:
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```
(This flood fill is useful for extracting core same-color components accurately.)

```python
def add_adjacent_twos(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    adj_twos = set()
    for i, j, _ in component:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and g[ni][nj] == 2 and (ni, nj) not in adj_twos:
                adj_twos.add((ni, nj))
                component.append((ni, nj, 2))
    return component
```
(This attaches 2's correctly to components, which is key for shape integrity, but note it only adds once per component and doesn't recurse for chained 2's.)

```python
def place_component(comp: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], start_r: int, out: List[List[int]], n: int):
    if not comp:
        return
    min_r_comp = min(r for r, _, _ in comp)
    min_c = min(c for _, c, _ in comp)
    max_c = max(c for _, c, _ in comp)
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    target_left = (n - w) // 2
    dx = target_left - min_c
    h = max(r for r, _, _ in comp) - min_r_comp + 1
    for r, c, val in comp:
        nr = start_r + (r - min_r_comp)
        nc = c + dx
        if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:
            out[nr][nc] = val
```
(This placement logic with relative offsets and centering is helpful but needs better overlap avoidance integration.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly implements flood fill for components and attachment of adjacent 2's, which preserves blob shapes including connectors, and identifies top/bottom-touching components accurately.
 * It worked partially for horizontal centering (target_left = (n - w)//2) and relative positioning within components, as seen in the generated outputs where blobs maintain their internal structure (e.g., 8's shapes in train1).
 * However, placement of special components (bottom at row 4, top at row 7) is too rigid and doesn't adapt to grid size or other components, leading to overlaps or gaps; in train1, bottom_comp (likely the 1's or 4's) is placed too low, causing the 8's to appear in row 8 instead of row 7 as expected.
 * Remaining components sorting by min_r is good, but the overlap avoidance loop (dy +=1, reset if too low, then dx +=1) is flawed—it doesn't check full height (h) before placing, causes infinite-like shifts in dense cases, and doesn't try multiple dy/dx combinations efficiently, resulting in misplacements like the 3's and 5's in train1 being scattered (e.g., 3's in row 4 expected but generated in row 18-20).
 * In train1, generated output has 8's correctly shaped but shifted right and down (rows 8-10 vs expected 7-9), 1's fragmented (row 12-18 with extras), and bottom elements like 4's/3's inverted wrong (generated row 17-20 vs expected row 4/18); specifically, expected has 3's blob at top (row4-5) which generated misses entirely in that position, and 5's/1's interlocking at bottom which generated flattens.
 * In train2, generated places 6's correctly at top but without adjacent 8's integration (expected merges 6's and 8's starting row5), 3's/1's/4's jumbled mid-grid (e.g., generated row13 has 4's/1's mixed wrong vs expected row8-13 with clean 1's bar and 3's), and bottom 8's missing (generated has them low but detached); unknown why 2's bridges fail to connect 8's properly here.
 * Removal of special components after placement works (avoids duplicates), but the fallback dx shift after dy overflow is unhelpful as it often pushes components off-center without resolving vertical packing, leading to empty rows (e.g., rows 0-6 empty in train2 generated vs expected starting row4).
 * The add_adjacent_twos function is helpful but limited— it adds 2's only to the initial component without recursing if 2's connect multiple blobs, potentially missing chained attachments; not broken but incomplete for complex 2-networks.
 * Overall, the program understands component extraction (helpful for blob isolation) but fails on packing logic, with no training example passing due to poor overlap handling and fixed start rows (4 and 7) that don't scale (e.g., train1 22x22 vs train2 similar but different densities).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (26x26 grid) does not look correct, as it places components in a scattered, non-stacked manner: e.g., small 8's/2's at top (rows1-3) but isolated, large 8's/9's/4's mid-grid (rows8-16) with awkward 2's intrusions, and bottom 1's/3's/7's (rows20-25) not centered or packed tightly, leaving huge empty spaces (rows3-7 empty).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: no clear inversion of edge-touchers (e.g., likely bottom 7's blob should be high up like train1's 3's, but generated low at row21-22), 2's are over-absorbed (e.g., row15 has 2's splitting 9's/4's unnaturally vs expected clean merges), and overall vertical stacking is broken with overlaps ignored (e.g., row13 9's/2's overlap potential but forced).
 * Components like the large 7's bar at row21 seem detached from 3's above, unlike training where bottom-touchers invert to top; the right-side placements (e.g., 7's cols21-26) are off-center, suggesting dx shift failed without proper width calc for irregular shapes.
 * 9's blob (rows12-16) is centered but shifted down too far, blocking potential top placements for edge components; unknown why 1's are in a thin vertical bar (rows17-20) instead of a wide base like expected interlocking in trains.
 * Empty rows and fragmented 2's (e.g., row0 all 0's, row23-25 sparse) indicate incomplete packing—test likely needs tighter vertical flow starting from row0 or4, but generated wastes space, making it look like a failed stacking rather than a solved puzzle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual rearrangement puzzle where the input grid contains connected components (blobs or shapes) of numbered cells (1-9, excluding 2's which act as connectors or extensions), and the goal is to extract these components, optionally augment them with adjacent or implied 2's based on touching top/bottom edges, order them by specific criteria (e.g., bottom-touching, top-touching, centroid height), and place them into a new empty grid in a stacked, centered manner with collision avoidance and horizontal shifts to form a coherent output image, likely representing a reorganized diagram or scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are found via flood fill for cells >0 and !=2, treating same-number adjacent (4-directional) cells as one object; 2's are not part of main components but can be attached if adjacent and below/above the main blob.
 * 2's above the minimum row of a main component (upper 2's) indicate "top touch" and may add an extra score or extension count, but are not included in the component itself; only unique upper 2's are counted.
 * Attached lower 2's (below or at min row) are flood-filled and added to the component if connected via 2's, extending the shape downward; this affects bottom-touch detection (if max row >= n-2).
 * For top-touching components, add "extra" 2's below the bottom row of the main component, in columns matching the bottom-most row's columns (up to the number of unique upper 2's), sorted by column to align left-to-right.
 * Ordering: Prioritize bottom-touching components first (take at most 1), then top-touching (at most 1), then remaining sorted by centroid row (lower centroid first?); if no top-touch, select the top-most (min min_r_main) as first.
 * Placement: Start at baseline row 4, center horizontally ((n - width)//2), use small horizontal shift (2) for top-touch components, larger (10) for others; for subsequent placements, search for lowest possible dy (tight packing above current max_r), preferring rightmost fitting dx within shift range to avoid overlaps; fallback to below current_max_r if no fit.
 * Subtleties: Components must be translated to relative coordinates from their collective min_r/min_c (including attached/extra 2's); overlaps are forbidden (out[nr][nc] must be 0); n=22 for all grids; 0's are empty; output must exactly match expected shapes/positions, including all 2's and numbers; missing or extra cells (e.g., unplaced components or wrong augmentations) cause failure.
 * Easy to miss: Upper 2's only count if strictly above min_r_main and adjacent; extra 2's for top-touch are placed exactly one row below the main's bottom, only in bottom-row columns (limited by upper_count); centroid is average row of main_comp only (ignores attached 2's); bottom-touch uses extended max_r with attached but not extra; if multiple bottom/top, only first is prioritized (unspecified tiebreaker); empty components skipped; all_cells_abs may be empty but fallback to main mins.
 * General: Preserve original values (e.g., 3's stay 3); no rotation/scaling; grid is square (22x22); puzzle likely assembles a larger scene (e.g., figures, bars, bases) where order creates narrative (bottom foundations, top elements, fillers).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single submission shown) correctly identifies and floods main components excluding 2's, augments with lower attached 2's via separate flood, and adds extra 2's for top-touch based on upper count and bottom columns.
 * Train 1: Generated output places 3's,5's,1's,8's,2's in wrong positions/rows (e.g., 3's high up with 5's adjacent but not matching expected stacked layout starting at row 4 with 3's/2's/8's/2's then lower 4/1/5 groups); misses many components (no 4's at all, wrong 1's shape, extra/missing 2's); 8's and 2's partially match but shifted; overall too sparse and high-placed, ignoring expected tight low packing.
 * Train 1: Bottom-touch detection likely wrong (e.g., 5's or 1's should extend with 2's to touch bottom?); ordering fails (starts with wrong first component, centroids not sorting fillers correctly); placement search prefers wrong dy/dx (e.g., not tight enough, wrong shift for top-touch).
 * Train 2: Generated output places 8's and 6's high, then 4's/2's mid, but misses most components (no 1's,3's at all; sparse 4's without extensions); expected has interleaved 6/8/2/1/3/4/2's in a complex mid-low stack; attachment of 2's to 4's wrong (shows isolated 2's); ordering ignores top/bottom touches (6's top-touch? 4's bottom?).
 * Train 2: Placement fallback too early (leaves bottom empty); shift logic pushes things right but not enough to fit all; rel_comp min_r_all incorrect for augmented shapes.
 * General issues: Only processes non-2 >0, but may skip implied components; upper_count over/under-counts if non-adjacent; extra 2's placed but not flood-connected; order takes [:1] for multiples but may pick wrong one; search for best_dy prefers low but not always tight (inf fallback too high); no handling for wide components overflowing center+shift.
 * Function `flood` is helpful and correct for isolation.
 * Function `process_component` is mostly helpful but buggy in attached 2's stack init (sets visited early, may miss some); extra_abs logic good but num=min(upper,len(bottom)) may under-add.
 * Function `place` is helpful and correct.
 * Overall program in `program` has good structure (components list, ordering, placement loop) but fails on integration (wrong order/positions lead to missing elements, overlaps not detected properly in search).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places a 3-blob (possibly top-touch with extras?) high up (rows 0-3) adjacent to a 9-blob, then 8's mid (rows 4-8) with isolated 2 below, leaving most of the grid empty below row 8; this is too top-heavy and sparse, missing likely lower components (e.g., no 1's,4's,5's,6's,7's visible, assuming test has more numbers).
 * Expected likely mirrors training: A stacked layout starting low (baseline ~4) with bottom-touch bases (e.g., extended 9's or 8's touching near row 20), then mid fillers, top elements with 2's connectors; current output ignores tight packing (huge empty space below), wrong ordering (3's and 9's first but not bottom-touch), and incomplete extraction (only 2-3 components placed, others dropped?); 3's shape augmented wrong (extra 3's? but shows connected); 8's missing parts (incomplete flood?); no horizontal alignment/collision avoidance working (9's overhang right).
 * To handle test: Ensure all components extracted/placed (e.g., if test has more blobs like train1/2); adjust ordering to prioritize true bottom-touch (with attached max_r); increase shift range or change dx preference (min abs instead of max?); verify 2's attachment includes all connected even non-adjacent starts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (blobs) of colored numbers (non-2 values) from an input grid, augmenting them with attached 2's (likely representing connectors or fillers) under specific rules (e.g., only lower attachments, conditional extras based on upper 2's and edge touches), normalizing their relative shapes, ordering them by properties like centroid and special flags (bottom-touching or top-edge-touching), and then packing them into a new output grid with prioritized placement (e.g., bottom components low, top high, others packed with shifts to avoid conflicts while allowing overlaps of same values).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected groups of the same non-2 positive value using 4-directional flood fill; 2's are ignored for main components but can be attached or added conditionally.
 * For each component: Compute min/max rows/cols; count unique upper 2's (above min row) and check if they touch row 0 (top edge); flood-fill attach only lower 2's (row >= min row, connected via 2's); compute centroid (average row of main cells); flag bottom-touch if max row (including attached) >= n-2; if top-edge-touch, add extra 2's below the main bottom in up to upper_count columns (sorted, starting from leftmost bottom cols).
 * Normalize to relative coords (shift to (0,0) min); combine main + attached + extras into rel_comp.
 * Ordering: Identify unique bottom-touch (highest centroid) and top-edge-touch (lowest centroid) components first; remove them; sort remaining by descending centroid (higher rows first, i.e., "bottom-up" placement?); place bottom at fixed dy=4, top at current_max_r+1, others starting from max(4, current_max_r - allowance=4) with vertical increments and horizontal center/right shifts (up to 10) if center conflicts.
 * Placement allows overwriting with same value or empty (0), but rejects different values; track current_max_r for stacking; out-of-bounds cells are skipped.
 * Subtleties: Upper 2's are just counted/set for conditions but not attached to rel_comp; extra 2's only if top-edge-touch and placed exactly one row below main bottom in specific cols; bottom flag uses max_r including attached; components with no cells skipped; n=22 for train1/2, 26 for test; overlaps must preserve values exactly (no mixing different numbers).
 * Potential misses: Flood fill might over/under-connect if 2's bridge mains incorrectly (but code excludes 2's from main); extra 2's col selection uses sorted bottom cols, limited by min(upper_count, bottom_cols); placement shifts only right from center, no left; fixed dy=4 for bottom might be too low/high; allowance=4 for packing start might cause overlaps or gaps; centroid is row-only (ignores cols); multiple bottom/top picks highest/lowest centroid if ties.
 * All attempts must handle empty rows/cols in output; preserve exact shapes/colors; no rotation/flipping; 0's are background.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies and extracts main components via flood fill (helpful for isolating blobs like the 8's, 3's, etc.), computes centroids and relative shapes, and attempts ordered packing with conflict checks and shifts.
 * What worked: Component extraction seems accurate (e.g., groups 8's together, 3's, 4's); relative normalization shifts to (0,0); placement logic avoids hard conflicts by allowing same-val overlaps; tracks current_max_r for stacking.
 * What didn't work: Both training examples are incorrect, with major misplacements and missing/incorrect 2 attachments. In Train 1: Generated places 8's high (row1-3) but expected lower (row7-9); 3's fragmented/misattached (row4-5 with wrong 2's/5's overlap); 4's low but shifted wrong (includes extra 3's/1's); 1's and 5's scattered/missing connections; no top/bottom specials seem applied correctly (e.g., expected bottom 1's/5's low, but generated has them mid). Differences: Generated has 8's too high, 2's attached to wrong blobs (e.g., under 8's but expected under 3's/4's), 5's partial; unknown why extras/attachments flood wrong (perhaps lower 2's overconnect across components).
 * In Train 2: Generated packs 8's/6's/1's/3's/4's high/mid but ignores many connections/2's; e.g., 6's partial (missing full shape), 3's right but no attachments, 4's absent/low; expected has 6's top, 8's mid with 2's, 1's/3's/4's lower with 2's bridging. Differences: Generated misses lower packing (all crammed rows4-8, empty below); no 2's placed at all; components like 4's/1's fragmented or omitted; unknown why top/bottom flags failed (e.g., expected bottom 4's/3's low).
 * process_component likely buggy: Attached 2's might flood too broadly (connecting unrelated 2's); extras added wrong cols/rows (e.g., Train1 generated extras under 8's but expected elsewhere); bottom dy=4 too rigid (causes overlaps); shifts only right, no left/center retry; allowance=4 too small, causes vertical gaps/overlaps.
 * get_all_processed and main program helpful for orchestration but fail on ordering (e.g., bottom/top not prioritized correctly, leading to high placement of low-centroid items).
 * No unhelpful functions; all aim at puzzle but execution errs (e.g., flood is solid, but integration with 2's handling broken).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears jumbled and incomplete, with components partially placed but misaligned, missing connections, and no coherent packing (e.g., 8's scattered across rows1-10 without full shape, 9's fragmented in rows8-11, 7's/4's clumped mid but overlapping wrong like 3's into 2's area, 1's trailing low/right but disconnected; many empty rows below despite space). Expected likely a stacked arrangement: top-edge items high (e.g., perhaps 8's or 9's up with upper 2's implied), bottom-touch low (e.g., 1's/4's at bottom with attached 2's), others packed mid by descending centroid, with 2's bridging/filling per rules (e.g., extras under top-touch if row0 2's present). Differences: No 2's placed systematically (only sparse, e.g., row5 col15); shapes distorted (e.g., 8's not contiguous full blob); right-side crowding (7's/4's/1's shifted far); ignores potential bottom flag for low 1's; overall lacks vertical spacing/stacking, looks like failed shift/packing (e.g., dy starts too low, shifts push off-center without resolving conflicts). Unknown why 3's/9's partial, but clearly doesn't match expected clean, rule-based rearrangement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of connected components (blobs or shapes) from an input grid, where each component consists of cells with the same positive integer value (representing distinct objects or colors), followed by normalizing their relative shapes, sorting them based on their original positions in the input (likely by row centroid to preserve top-to-bottom order), and reassembling them into a new output grid by placing them without overlap in a specific order and position (e.g., packing from the top-left available space, but potentially starting from a baseline row or in sorted order to match expected layouts with leading zero rows).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components must be connected orthogonally (4 directions: up, down, left, right) and only cells with the *exact same value* (>0) should be grouped together—do not merge different values, even if adjacent, as this creates invalid oversized or hybrid shapes.
 * Normalize shapes relative to the minimum row and column in each component to get a "bounding box" origin at (0,0), preserving the internal structure and values.
 * Compute a centroid (e.g., average row position) for sorting; sort components by *increasing* centroid row (top-first in original grid) rather than decreasing, as the current decreasing sort (bottom-first) leads to reversed order in output.
 * Placement must avoid overlaps: when placing a shape, check that target cells are empty (0) or match the value (though ideally empty since shapes are distinct); try positions starting from top-left (smallest row, then smallest column) within bounds, but the expected outputs have leading zero rows (e.g., rows 0-3 empty in train1), suggesting shapes are packed starting from a specific baseline (e.g., row 4) or only after sorting and fitting without forcing top placement.
 * Output grid is same size as input (n x n), initialized to zeros; all original shapes must be placed exactly, without rotation, scaling, or modification, and unused areas remain 0.
 * Subtle: Components may have irregular shapes (e.g., spaced cells like "E" or "H" forms in expected), holes aren't mentioned but shouldn't affect connectivity; ensure no out-of-bounds placement; if a shape can't fit in a "preferred" spot, fallback to bottom-left may overwrite or misplace, but expecteds suggest all fit cleanly when ordered correctly.
 * Grids seem square (e.g., 22x22 for train1/2, possibly 26x26 for test based on line lengths); values are small positives (1-9), zeros are empty.
 * Potential for multiple components of same value? Treat as separate if not connected.
 * Ordering impacts placement: wrong sort leads to shapes appearing in incorrect vertical sequence (e.g., bottom shapes at top of output).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core issue: find_components merges adjacent cells of different values into single components (e.g., 3's connected to 2's), leading to distorted shapes that don't match expecteds (e.g., in train1 generated, hybrid 3-2-5-4-1 blobs at top; in train2, mixed 8-2-1-3-4-6; test has jumbled 3-2-7-9-4-1-8).
 * Sorting by decreasing centroid (-x[0]) places bottom-original shapes first/at top of output, but expecteds have top-original shapes higher (e.g., train1 expected starts with horizontal 3's at row4, likely a top shape; train2 expected has 6's at row4, then 8's/2's/1's/3's/4's lower—suggests increasing sort for top-first placement).
 * Placement loop starts from top (sr=0), filling immediately, causing no leading zero rows (e.g., train1 generated fills row0 with 3's/2's/5's; expecteds have rows 0-3 zero); fallback to bottom-left (sr=n-height) sometimes used but overwrites or mispositions when can't place (e.g., test generated has shapes crammed at top rows 0-8, ignoring potential baseline).
 * Overlap check is partially correct (avoids different values), but since components are wrong, it leads to partial placements or skips; expecteds have no overlaps and exact shape preservation (e.g., train1 expected has isolated "E"-like 8's, spaced 3's/2's, L-shaped 4's with 1's/2's/5's—no merging).
 * get_rel_shape, get_centroid, get_dimensions are helpful and correct for normalization/sizing/sorting.
 * Overall program structure (extract -> sort -> place sequentially) is a good skeleton, but broken by connectivity and sort/placement logic; no rotation or value changes attempted (correct, as expecteds preserve them).
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has dense top-packed hybrids (e.g., row0: 3's then 2/5's; row3: 8's/5's/4's/1's), expected has clean separate shapes lower (e.g., row4: 3's row; row5: spaced 3's; row7: 8's row; row12: 4's with attachments; unknown why baseline at row4, perhaps implicit padding or sort order).
 * Train2 mismatches: generated mixes at top (row0: 8's/2's/6's; row1: 8's/1's/3's/4's/6's), expected has separate lower (row4: 6's; row5: spaced 6's/8's; row8: spaced 2's/1's/3's; row13: 4's—reversed order effect).
 * Test output: Does not look correct—shapes are merged/hybrid (e.g., row0 starts with 3's/2's; row1 has 7's block with 4's/2's/1's/8's mixed; row5 has 8's block with 2's/9's), placed densely at top (rows 0-8 filled, rest zero), ignoring leading zeros and exact separations; expecteds suggest clean, separate components packed lower/mid-grid in original order (likely top-first), so this is invalid (e.g., 7/9 blocks should be isolated, not adjacent to 4's/1's unless same-value connected, which they're not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it's a messy top-packed grid with merged shapes (e.g., 3's adjacent to 2's in row0, 7's block bleeding into 4's/1's/8's in rows1-2), no leading zero rows, and incomplete lower placement (rows9+ all zero, suggesting failed placements or early stops); this mismatches expected patterns from training (clean, separate same-value blobs, starting after zero rows ~row4, in sorted order without hybrids).
 * Likely wrong due to same-value connectivity bug (merges distinct objects like 3-2, 7-4-1-8) and top-first placement without padding/baseline, causing overlap avoidance failures; to handle test, fix to same-value components, sort increasing centroid, and add baseline start (e.g., sr from 4) or pack only after all zeros above.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where connected components of non-2 values (representing "main" objects like blobs or shapes of numbers 1,3,4,5,6,8,9) must be extracted, augmented with adjacent or connected 2's (acting as attachments or extensions), ordered by specific rules involving centroids and touch flags, and then rearranged into a new output grid starting from row 4 (index 4), centered horizontally, with vertical stacking and minor shifts to avoid overlaps, while preserving relative shapes and handling special cases for top-touching (low row) and bottom-touching (high row) components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Main components are connected groups of the same positive integer (non-2, non-0) using 4-directional flood fill; ignore 0's (empty) and 2's (special connectors) during extraction.
 * 2's are not main components but must be attached if they form connected groups (via other 2's) that touch any cell of a main component; this expands the component shape without changing the main value.
 * For top-touching components (those with attached 2's above the minimum row of the main part), add extra virtual 2's below the main component's bottom row, matching the number of upper 2's (up to the width of the bottom row's columns), placed in sorted column order; this seems to "balance" or extend the shape downward for placement rules.
 * Compute properties like relative normalized shape (shifted to (0,0) origin), centroid (average row for vertical positioning/ordering), height/width of full shape (main + attached + extra 2's), and flags for top-touch (any 2 above min main row) and bottom-touch (full shape reaches near grid bottom, e.g., max row >= n-2).
 * Ordering: Prioritize the single bottom-touch component with the highest (deepest) centroid first; then non-touch components by increasing centroid; finally the single top-touch component with the lowest (shallowest) centroid last; this creates a specific sequence like bottom-heavy -> middle -> top-light.
 * Placement starts at row 4 (0-indexed), centered horizontally ((n - w)//2); try tight vertical packing below the current max occupied row, then scan downward from row 4 with small horizontal shifts (±1 to ±5) if conflicts (defined as placing over non-empty non-matching value); fallback to bottom of grid if unplaceable; overlaps allow same-value or empty (0), but not different values.
 * Grid size is square (n x n), outputs are n x n with 0's elsewhere; subtle: components may span irregularly, 2's can connect diagonally? No, 4-directional only; extra 2's are virtual (not from input) and only for top-touch balancing; ignore isolated 2's or 0's entirely.
 * Easy to miss: Centroid is row-only (vertical bias for ordering); relative shape includes all parts (main, attached, extra); placement skips out-of-bounds cells; bottom-touch flag uses full shape max row vs. grid bottom; ordering assumes at most one bottom/top per category (code picks max/min if multiple).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle varying grid sizes (22x22 in training, 26x26 in test?); components can be sparse/irregular (e.g., not solid blocks); 2's might form bridges or extensions that change effective height/width/centroid; ensure no overwriting of different values during placement; top-touch extra 2's use bottom row's columns (sorted) for positioning, limiting to min(upper_count, bottom_width).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly implements component extraction via flood fill and 2-attachment via seed flooding, which identifies main shapes and extensions accurately (e.g., groups 5's together, attaches nearby 2's).
 * Ordering by bottom-touch (highest centroid) first, then ascending centroid, top-touch (lowest) last works conceptually but fails in practice due to miscomputed centroids or flags, leading to wrong sequence (e.g., in Train 1, 8's placed low but expected higher; 5's/1's misplaced).
 * Placement logic starting at row 4 with centering and shifts avoids some overlaps but generates incorrect layouts: in Train 1, generated has 5's/3's/1's jammed in row 4-5 with scattered 2's/8's below, but expected spreads 3's/8's higher (rows 4-7), adds 4's/1's/5's lower (rows 11-17) in different shapes; unknown why 5's appear extended incorrectly or 4's missing entirely.
 * In Train 2, generated places 6's/8's/4's compactly in rows 4-7 with some 2's, but expected separates 6's higher (rows 4-7), interleaves 8's/1's/3's/4's lower (rows 8-13) with more precise 2-placements; misses isolating certain components or wrong attachment (e.g., extra 2's not added for top-touch 6's?).
 * compute_component_properties adds extra 2's for top-touch but may over/under-count upper_set or misplace extras (e.g., Train 1 generated has no extras visible, but expected has balanced shapes like extended 1's/5's).
 * can_place/do_place handle conflicts by allowing same-value/0 but not others, which is correct, but fallback to bottom causes overcrowding; tight dy_try often fails due to h/w miscalc from irregular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant (flood/extract/attach/properties/placement); none are broken per se, but properties dict may have centroid bug (uses full cells including 2's/extras, but perhaps should weight main only? unknown).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places a 9-shape (likely main 9's with attached 2's) in rows 4-8 centered-leftish, an irregular 3/2 mix below it in row 7-8 overlapping slightly, and a wide 8-shape with trailing 2's in rows 9-13, but this seems too compact and left-biased compared to training expectations of more vertical spread starting row 4, centered, with distinct stacking (e.g., expected might separate 9's high, 3's mid, 8's low with balanced extras/attachments).
 * Missing potential top-touch handling: the 9's have 2's above/inline (row 6-7), suggesting top-touch, so extras should add 2's below, but generated lacks visible downward extension; 8's at bottom may be bottom-touch but not prioritized first.
 * 2's are scattered (e.g., row 5 col15, row12 col14), possibly from attachments, but don't form expected bridges or balances; overall, layout ignores ordering subtlety (e.g., if 8's are bottom-touch, they should place first/lowest, but here they're mid-low); unknown if grid size (26x26?) affects centering ((26-w)//2), leading to left shift.
 * Does not make sense as correct: Unlike expected training outputs' clean, separated shapes (e.g., Train 1's distinct 3/8/4/1/5 blocks), test generated has overlapping/jumbled 3/2/8 areas (rows 7-8), suggesting failed can_place shifts or wrong relative_comp normalization.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual assembly puzzle where the input grid contains disconnected colored components (non-red pixels representing puzzle pieces) and red pixels (acting as connectors or attachment points). The goal is to identify these components, determine valid attachment points via reds, and reassemble them into a coherent structure (e.g., a train-like vehicle) by translating and placing them relative to a central "yellow" (color 4) base piece, using rules for vertical stacking above, side attachments on left/right, and horizontal chaining to the right.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected groups of the same non-red color; reds (color 2) are not part of components but serve as exclusive attachment points— a red is "attached" to a component only if all its non-red neighbors belong to that single component (no sharing across components).
 * Yellow (color 4) is the mandatory base; if absent, output an empty grid. Place it first at its original position, then attach others relative to it.
 * Vertical attachments (above yellow or in chains): Require a "top bar" on the lower piece (a full contiguous row of pixels at its top, without gaps) and "bottom two reds" on the upper piece (exactly two reds at the bottom row, separated by a distance that the lower bar can "span" — bar length >= distance between reds +1). Chains are built by recursively stacking pieces that can attach this way, preferring longer chains or better spans (minimal overhang).
 * Side attachments (left/right of yellow's second row): Use chains with a single "side bottom red" at the bottom row (left side: red at column 0 of bottom; right side: red at max column of bottom). For left chain, attach via its right-side red to yellow's left edge (column min_c -1) at row min_r +1; for right chain, attach via left-side red to yellow's right edge (max_c +1). Sort chains by color ascending to assign lowest color to left, next to right.
 * Horizontal attachments (right of yellow): Chain remaining pieces sequentially, attaching via top bar to the previous piece's right edge (often at a "bottom" level like row +1 per step, or using right-side reds if present at top row for level continuation; if no right red at top, drop to next row). In examples, this often involves single-red or no-red attachments, and may include reds placed but not always used for spanning.
 * Subtleties: Reds are placed in output but don't connect visually— they indicate attachment validity. Attachments must align exactly (no rotation, only translation). Chains should be maximal/non-overlapping, built bottom-up. In examples, not all pieces attach (e.g., some remain unplaced if no valid connector). Yellow's second row is key for side/horizontal starts, even without reds there. Overlaps are forbidden (new_grid starts empty, placements overwrite 0 only). Grids are 22x22 in examples, but general. Bugs like unpacking None (e.g., missing top_bar or bottom_two_red) cause crashes— always check for None before unpacking.
 * Edge cases: Components with no valid bars/reds can't attach. Multiple chains possible, but select best (longest, closest span). Horizontal may zigzag rows (e.g., +1 row per piece if no level-holding red). Colors are unique per component in examples, but sort by color for ordering. Unattached pieces (e.g., isolated) stay unplaced.

    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
Basic 4-connected neighbor finder; essential for BFS and attachment checks.

```python
def find_connected_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, Set[Tuple[int, int]]]]:

                while queue:
                    cr, cc = queue.popleft()
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if grid[nr][nc] == color and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                            visited.add((nr, nc))
                            queue.append((nr, nc))

                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```
Core function to extract components by color using BFS; works well, ignores reds correctly.

```python
def get_attached_reds(grid: List[List[int]], comp_pos: Set[Tuple[int, int]], all_nonred_pos: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    candidate_reds = set()
    for r, c in comp_pos:
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(r, c, rows, cols):
            if grid[nr][nc] == 2:
                candidate_reds.add((nr, nc))
    attached = set()
    for r, c in candidate_reds:
        only_this = True
        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(r, c, rows, cols):
            if (nr, nc) in all_nonred_pos and (nr, nc) not in comp_pos:
                only_this = False
                break
        if only_this:
            attached.add((r, c))
    return attached
```
Correctly finds exclusive reds attached to one component; crucial for connectors, handles sharing prevention.

```python
def get_component_bbox(comp: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, c in comp]
    cs = [c for r, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
Simple bounding box; useful for translation calculations.

```python
def get_top_bar(comp: Set[Tuple[int, int]], min_c: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    min_r, max_r, _, max_c = get_component_bbox(comp)
    top_row_cs = set(c - min_c for r, c in comp if r == min_r)
    if top_row_cs:
        min_top = min(top_row_cs)
        max_top = max(top_row_cs)
        length = max_top - min_top + 1
        if length == len(top_row_cs):  # No gaps
            return min_top, max_top, length
    return None
```
Detects gap-free top row for spanning; helpful but assumes relative to min_c—works for vertical attachments.

```python
def get_bottom_two_red(reds: Set[Tuple[int, int]], comp_min_r: int, comp_min_c: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    bottom_rel_r = -1  # Adjust to actual max_r +1 if needed
    max_r = max(r for r, c in reds)
    bottom_reds = [(r - comp_min_r, c - comp_min_c) for r, c in reds if r == max_r]
    if len(bottom_reds) == 2:
        rc1, rc2 = sorted(bottom_reds, key=lambda x: x[1])
        dist = rc2[1] - rc1[1]
        return max_r - comp_min_r, rc1[1], rc2[1], dist
    return None
```
Identifies exactly two bottom reds for vertical ports; key for stacking, but buggy (uses -1 rel_r, assumes max_r is bottom).

```python
def can_span(dist: int, bar_length: int) -> bool:
    return bar_length >= dist + 1
```
Simple span check; correct and essential for vertical validation.

```python
def translate_set(pos: Set[Tuple[int, int]], dr: int, dc: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {(r + dr, c + dc) for r, c in pos}

def place_pixels(grid: List[List[int]], pos: Set[Tuple[int, int]], color: int):
    for r, c in pos:
        if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]):
            grid[r][c] = color
```
Basic translation and placement; bounds-checked, useful but doesn't handle overlaps (assumes no conflicts).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt; component extraction (find_connected_components, get_attached_reds) works correctly in identifying pieces and exclusive reds, as seen in partial placements matching input positions before translation.
 * Vertical chain building (build_vertical_chains, can_attach_upper) conceptually grasps stacking via bars and two-red bottoms but fails in recursion (recurse function builds all subsets, not just valid chains; no filtering for disjoint/maximal). In train1, no upper chain attached (yellow top_bar detected but no matching chain), leading to missing 8 and 3 above. In train2, partial vertical (6 placed wrong).
 * Side attachments partially work: In train1, detected side reds but placement logic flips left/right (uses right red for left chain, but target_c = min_c -1 misaligns; 5 placed but at wrong row/col, and 3 not as side). In train2, no sides detected/placed.
 * Horizontal chaining fails: In train1, places 3 and 1 wrong (3 under yellow instead of right; 1 fragmented and row-dropped incorrectly, missing full bar at bottom). In train2, places 1 and 3 horizontally but misaligned (1 not full row, 3 shifted left). Update current_attach_row/col logic doesn't handle "drop +1 row per piece without top red" properly, and right_red_rel check assumes bottom but needs top-level for continuation.
 * get_side_bottom_red is broken/not helpful: Hardcodes bottom_rel_r = h-1 but filters for side cols only; returns None often if red not exactly at bottom (e.g., train1 right red for horizontal is at row+1, not bottom). Doesn't generalize to any row for horizontal.
 * get_bottom_two_red buggy: rel_r hardcoded -1, uses actual max_r from reds (assumes reds define bottom, but comp bbox needed); unpacking fails if None, causing test error.
 * build_vertical_chains recurse includes self-loops (i == current_bottom_idx skip insufficient) and doesn't enforce position disjointness, leading to overlapping/invalid chains.
 * Yellow handling good (placed correctly), but second_row assumes +1 without checking structure; in train1, horizontal starts at yellow_max_c but ignores if yellow has right red (train1 has none, but expected attaches without).
 * Overall, placements start from original positions then translate wrong (dr/dc calcs use rel ports but ignore full bbox shifts); no overlap checks. Train1 generated has yellow/reds partial, 8/3/1/5 misplaced or fragmented (e.g., 3 at wrong height, 1 not contiguous bar, 5 shifted right with extra 2). Train2 has 6/8/1/3/5 wrong (6 left of yellow instead of above/right mix, 8 not attached, 1/3 horizontal but row-misaligned, 5 missing). Differences unknown for some (e.g., why 3 in train1 at row12 col12-16 instead of expected row17 col10-14 bar).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error ("cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object"), likely from unpacking None in get_top_bar or get_bottom_two_red/get_side_bottom_red during chain building or placement (e.g., a component lacks required bar/reds, causing None unpack in for-loops like bottom_port = get_bottom_two_red(...); if bottom_port: _,_,_,dist = bottom_port).
 * This does not look correct— the program crashes instead of producing a valid grid, indicating unhandled cases (e.g., test may have components without top bars or single reds, breaking assumptions). Expected output unknown without test input grid, but error suggests missing None-checks (e.g., if not bottom_port: continue) and better error handling for attachments. To handle test, add guards around unpacking (e.g., if bottom_port and len(bottom_port)==4: ... ) and skip invalid chains/pieces.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction and rearrangement of colored connected components (blobs) from an input grid into a structured output grid, resembling a "train" or modular vehicle layout with vertical or horizontal configurations, connected by red (2) trim elements, and specific alignments for colors like green (3), maroon (8), blue (1), yellow (4), and pink (6). The output preserves the relative shapes of input blobs but repositions them with rules for adjacency, trims, and stacking, while leaving most of the grid as 0s and avoiding overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Configurations depend on color presence: vertical stacking (e.g., green on top, then maroon, red trims below) if no pink (6); horizontal layout (e.g., pink first, then side-by-side blue/yellow/green) if pink present—mismatching this leads to wrong starting positions and overlaps.
 * Red (2) acts as connectors/trims: vertical trims below blob bottoms (using leg positions from bottom row DCs), horizontal trims adjacent to sides (e.g., left of blue); but avoid over-adding reds in non-connection spots, as this fills empty areas incorrectly.
 * Extract and place blobs relatively: Use min_r/min_c offsets to normalize shapes, then place at fixed starts (e.g., green at r=4,c=8; blue at c=10; yellow at c=9); preserve exact sparsity/holes in blobs (e.g., don't fill greens or maroons solidly).
 * Alignments and abutments: Blue abuts yellow horizontally (as pivot), green abuts blue rightward; maroon often below or right-shifted; extras (e.g., orange=5) stacked rightward vertically; subtle overlaps allowed in some configs (e.g., maroon start_r = red_r +1).
 * Height calculations: Use max dr +1 for stacking next components below (e.g., red at h_green, maroon at red_r+1); approximate gaps (+1 or +3) for spacing, but avoid hardcoding if shapes vary.
 * Extra colors: Place remaining colors (beyond 1,2,3,4,8) stacked vertically on right (c=17), but only if present; don't invent or misplace like 7/9 in test.
 * Subtle omissions: Top 4 rows always 0s; no distortion of input shapes (e.g., green in ex1 is sparse with holes, not solid); connections only at specific points (e.g., blue-maroon bbox adjacents); handle empty positions gracefully (early return if no pos).
 * Across attempts: Fixed starts (e.g., current_y=4) work for top placement but fail if shapes taller; simplistic red additions (loop over r,c=[12,16,...]) pollute grid; reuse of rules (e.g., rule_cluster_blue_yellow calling others) causes duplication/misplacement; vertical vs horizontal mode helps but buggy (e.g., yellow below in horizontal mode overlaps).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_positions(g: List[List[int]], color: int, size: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(r, c) for r in range(size) for c in range(size) if g[r][c] == color]
```
(Extracts all positions of a color—essential for identifying blobs.)

```python

    min_c = min(c for r, c in pos)
    rel = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in pos]
    return min_r, min_c, rel
```
(Normalizes blob to (0,0) origin—key for preserving shape when placing.)

```python
def place_component(output: List[List[int]], rel: List[Tuple[int, int]], color: int, start_r: int, start_c: int, size: int):
    for dr, dc in rel:
        if 0 <= start_r + dr < size and 0 <= start_c + dc < size:
            output[start_r + dr][start_c + dc] = color
```
(Places a normalized blob at a start position, bounds-checked—core for non-overlapping insertion.)

        if 0 <= start_r < size and 0 <= start_c + dc < size:
            output[start_r][start_c + dc] = 2
```
(Adds vertical red trim below a blob's bottom legs—useful but limited to vertical; needs horizontal counterpart.)

 * Mode detection (if 6 in colors) correctly branches to horizontal (pink-led) vs vertical (green-led), but execution fails: in ex1 (no pink, vertical), green/maroon/red stack roughly aligns but green is solid-filled (ignores input sparsity), extra reds at c=16/17 pollute right side, blue/yellow placed too low/right with wrong shapes (e.g., yellow at r=11-13,c=10-11 overlaps red), orange(5) misplaced low-right.
 * In ex2 (pink present, horizontal), pink places okay but with extra reds below/immediately, maroon shifts wrong (to c=12 but overlaps pink reds), blue/green/yellow cluster misaligned (e.g., blue at c=10 but with wrong rel shape, green at c=13 but sparse input not preserved), yellow below pink at +3 gap but overlaps, tons of extra reds from final loop fill lower grid uselessly.
 * What worked: Blob extraction/placement basics (shapes mostly preserved in size, colors correct); vertical trim logic identifies bottom legs accurately; extra color stacking attempts right-side vertical.
 * What didn't: Over-adds reds (e.g., horizontal simplistic in rule_horizontal_blue_maroon_red only at fixed [start_y][start_c-1], but misses full bbox; final loop adds irrelevant reds at fixed c=[9,10,12,13,16]); ignores input blob sparsity (e.g., ex1 green row4 solid 3s vs expected sparse; ex2 maroon row5-6 has 2s inside); wrong starts/gaps (e.g., ex1 maroon at r=7,c=8 but expected r=7,c=8 sparse; ex2 yellow not clustered properly); no horizontal trim function (reuses vertical wrongly); place_pink_horizontal buggy (red_r_m = max(...) but leg_dcs_m uses wrong bottom_dr).
 * rule_pivot_yellow_blue_green and rule_align_green_blue help chain placements but cause overlaps/duplication when called in wrong order/mode.
 * add_red_trims_vertical is helpful for vertical but broken for horizontal (needs dc/r swap); place_extra_color good for extras but starts at fixed c=17, stacks with +1 gap (may overlap if tall).
 * Overall, program understands component extraction but fails on precise positioning, sparsity, and targeted reds—leads to cluttered, mismatched outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows a messy vertical stack starting at r=4 with green(3) partially sparse but with extra 2s inside (e.g., row5 c=9-10=2, expected clean), maroon(8) at r=9-12 but fragmented/wrong rel (e.g., row10 c=8=8 but then 2s/0s), yellow(4)/blue(1) at r=14-16 mixed with 1s/2s but shapes distorted (e.g., row15 c=11=1 inside yellow?), extras like 7 (r=17 c=17-22 solid, possibly orange-like but wrong color/placement) and 9 (r=19-25 scattered low-right, wrong shape/position). Massive red pollution (2s at every connection and beyond, e.g., columns 16-17 filled vertically, row8-9 full 2-trim). Differs from expected pattern (based on trainings): Should have clean top-4 0s, sparse blobs, targeted reds only at bottoms/sides (e.g., no internal 2s, no invented 7/9 positions), right-side extras stacked without overlap, horizontal elements if pink (but test seems vertical-mode). Likely mode wrong or extraction failed for test input's colors/shapes; doesn't match training expectations of structured train without filler.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual assembly puzzle where colored polyomino-like components (excluding empty space 0 and red attachments 2) must be extracted from an input grid, repositioned on a new blank grid with the yellow component (color 4) anchored vertically at the grid's middle row (n//2), and other components attached or positioned relative to it using red dots as docking ports, prioritizing multi-point alignments before fallback rules for singles or unattached pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected groups of the same non-zero, non-red color; isolated cells count as components even if size 1.
 * Red cells (2) adjacent to exactly one component are "attached" to that component and move with it; reds adjacent to multiple or none are ignored for attachment.
 * Yellow (4) is always placed first, shifted only vertically to center its top row at n//2, with no horizontal shift (dc_y=0); its attached reds are placed as 2s.
 * Attachment prioritizes greedy placement: for shapes with reds, test all possible shifts (dr, dc) relative to existing placed reds, favoring shifts that match >=2 reds (or >=1 if the shape has only 1 red); among ties, prefer minimal Manhattan distance; only attempt shapes with at least one red.
 * Unplaced shapes after greedy phase use fallbacks: no-red shapes align top-left to yellow's position; single-red shapes dock to nearest existing red; multi-red shapes (assumed "B-type" if exactly 2 reds on the bottom row) try to align their bottom-left red pair to the leftmost row with >=2 reds (using the rightmost red in that row for horizontal offset, plus yellow's width); otherwise, default to yellow-aligned positioning.
 * All placements must stay within grid bounds [0,n-1]; out-of-bounds parts are clipped (not placed).
 * Output is a new grid with placed components and their attached reds (as 2s); unattachable or default-placed items still go on the grid but may overlap or misalign if rules fail.
 * Subtlety: Component bounding boxes (minr/maxr/minc/maxc) are used for default positioning but not for attachment—attachment is purely red-to-red matching.
 * Subtlety: When placing, shape cells overwrite output (no overlap checks); reds are added as 2s only if in bounds, and placed reds accumulate for future attachments.
 * Easy to miss: Yellow's width (y_width) is used in B-type horizontal offset to "append" right of yellow; candidate merge rows are only those with >=2 reds already placed.
 * Easy to miss: Greedy loop only considers shapes with reds; no-red shapes are always deferred to fallback.
 * Consideration: Grid size n is odd/even agnostic but centering assumes integer n//2; test inputs may have n=22 or 26 (even), affecting exact centering.
 * Consideration: Colors like 1,3,6,7,8,9 represent distinct shapes; no rotation/reflection—preserve input orientation and relative positions.
 * Consideration: If no yellow, output empty grid; if components empty, also empty.
 * Across attempts: Red attachment detection must use 4 directions only (no diagonals); stack-based flood fill for components to handle irregular shapes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple, Set

def find_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict]:
    # Flood-fill to extract connected components of same color (non-0, non-2), including singles.
    # Returns list of dicts with 'color', 'cells' (list of (r,c)), and bounding box 'minr','maxr','minc','maxc'.
    # Uses DFS stack and visited matrix; 4-directional adjacency.
    # Helpful: Correctly identifies all components, including small/irregular ones; bounding box aids default positioning.
```

```python
def find_attached_reds(grid: List[List[int]], components: List[Dict]) -> None:
    # For each red (2), check 4-adjacent cells; if exactly one adjacent component, attach that red's position to the component's 'reds' list.
    # Uses cell_to_comp mapping for quick lookup; modifies components in place.
    # Helpful: Essential for identifying movable ports; ignores reds touching multiple/no components (stationary or free).
```

```python
def place_shape(output: List[List[int]], shape: Dict, dr: int, dc: int, n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Shifts shape's cells by (dr,dc), places color in output if in bounds; separately collects new red positions (but doesn't place them—caller does).
    # Returns list of shifted red positions.
    # Helpful: Core placement logic; clips out-of-bounds; separates cells from reds for flexible handling.
    # Note: In usage, caller then places reds as 2s and adds to placed_reds set.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully: All components correctly extracted, yellow centered, attachments via reds worked (multi/single matches), fallbacks unused or correct—output matched expected.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated output mostly matched expected (yellow at row 4-5-ish, most shapes like 1,3,4,8 placed correctly with reds), but the 6-shape (likely a vertical piece with reds) was misplaced— in generated, row 5 has 6 at col7, then 8s starting col9 (overlapping/merged visually), row 6 has 6 at col7 then 8 at col10; expected has separate 6s at col7-9 in rows 5-6, with 8s shifted right starting col13. Effect: 6 appears attached to 8-block instead of independent/docked separately; unknown why—possibly greedy attachment favored 6 to existing 8-reds over correct single/distance, or fallback miscomputed dr/dc for 6's reds. Reds in row7 (2s at col7,9,12,15) placed correctly in both.
 * Greedy attachment loop worked partially: Successfully placed some multi-red shapes (e.g., 8-block docked), but over-prioritized or miscalculated shifts for 6, leading to partial overlap/misposition.
 * Fallback for multi-red (B-type) seemed unused or incorrect for 6 (if it had 2 bottom reds, didn't align to row with 2 reds properly).
 * find_components and find_attached_reds helpful and correct (components match input in both trains).
 * place_shape helpful but in train2, when placing 6, it overwrote or shifted into 8's space without clip handling the intent.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided are relevant, though the B-type fallback logic (port_row detection, merge_row candidates) may be buggy for non-exact-2-reds-on-bottom cases like 6.
 * extract_objects not present but implied in components—essential for shape isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (n=26) partially makes sense but likely incorrect overall: Yellow (4) correctly centered vertically around rows 14-17 (n//2=13, but placed starting row12 with vertical shift); components like 9 (top-right, rows7-10), 8 (rows11-13, docked via reds), 1 (rows13-16 left), 7 (row18 bottom-left), 3 (row19) extracted/placed visibly. Reds accumulated and used for docking (e.g., 2s in row12 col6/10, row17 col5/10). However, it doesn't look fully correct—e.g., the large 8 in row10 cols9-16 seems shifted left into where reds are, potentially overlapping unplaced space; bottom 2s in row20 cols6/10 undocked; shape 9's reds in row8 col14/18 not aligning to any existing 2s perfectly (single-red fallback?); overall layout spreads left-heavy, but puzzle likely expects tighter right-append via yellow width in B-type or better greedy multi-matches (e.g., if input has B-shapes with 2 bottom reds, they should align to rows like 12 with 2+ reds, offsetting by yellow's width ~6-7 cols). Missing: Potential clipping of out-of-bounds (e.g., input 9 at cols14-18 shifted to 14-18 ok, but 8's extent might clip); no empty rows at top/bottom as in trains, but input has them—output preserves spacing poorly. Effect: Shapes present but positions misaligned (e.g., 8/9 too close, 7/3 undocked left instead of appended); differs from train2 error pattern (mis-dock) but similar (greedy/fallback bug). To handle test, update greedy to better prioritize non-overlapping shifts or refine B-type to check all multi-red configs beyond just bottom-2.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Consistent Interactions and Connections

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (Train 1 and Train 2), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interconnections between components and properties. These are limited to patterns that appear identically in **every** train example (both inputs and their corresponding outputs). I focused solely on elements with clear, repeated interactions or effects (e.g., positional adjacency, preservation under transformation, or direct association via proximity). Irrelevant elements (e.g., black background, isolated properties like holes=0 which never vary or interact) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or speculation on overall mechanics is included. Where a transformation or effect cannot be explained consistently (e.g., exact movement rules), it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Colored Shapes (Non-Red Blobs) and Pixel Count Preservation**
   - **Interaction**: Pixel count (pixels property) of each non-Red colored shape (e.g., Blue, Green, Maroon, Yellow, Orange, Pink) directly determines its identity and remains invariant, affecting its translation as a rigid unit.
   - **Consistency**: In every train input and output, shapes with matching pixel counts (e.g., Yellow always p=9; Blue p=15 in Train 1, p=11 in Train 2) preserve this value exactly, ensuring no deformation or splitting. This property "locks" the shape's integrity during position changes.
   - **Effect**: Pixel count constrains movement—shapes move as whole units without pixel loss/gain, interacting with position updates.

#### 2. **Colored Shapes (Non-Red Blobs) and Bounding Box Dimensions**
   - **Interaction**: Bounding box dimensions (width = x2 - x1 + 1; height = y2 - y1 + 1) of non-Red shapes are preserved, linking shape geometry to translation.
   - **Consistency**: Every non-Red shape in both trains maintains identical width and height across input to output (e.g., Train 1 Blue: 6x6; Train 2 Green: 4x5; Maroon in Train 1: 5x3; all unchanged). This geometric property "effects" movement by enforcing rigid translation without rotation or resizing.
   - **Effect**: Dimensions interact with position (bbox coordinates) to define how the shape relocates—new positions reuse the same size, ensuring adjacency potential with other elements.

#### 3. **Non-Red Colored Shapes and Translation (Position -> Position)**
   - **Interaction**: The position (bbox coordinates) of non-Red shapes (except Yellow) consistently transforms via translation, where initial position affects final position in a way that brings shapes closer or adjacent.
   - **Consistency**: In every train, all non-Red shapes except Yellow undergo pure translation (x/y offsets applied uniformly to bbox), preserving color, pixels, and dimensions (e.g., Train 1 Green moves from [1,18,5,19] to [8,4,12,5]; Train 2 Pink from [16,3,18,5] to [7,4,9,6]). Yellow's position is unaffected (stationary).
   - **Effect**: Initial position directly effects the output position, resulting in clustered configurations. Exact offset rule (e.g., how initial coords determine delta) is unknown and inconsistent in pattern across trains.

#### 4. **Yellow Shape and Stationary Position**
   - **Interaction**: The Yellow shape (always p=9, ~3x3 bbox) has no positional transformation, making its fixed location a "anchor" that interacts with surrounding elements' clustering.
   - **Consistency**: In every train input and output, Yellow remains at the exact same bbox (Train 1: [9,11,11,13]; Train 2: [10,11,12,13]), unaffected by translations of other shapes.
   - **Effect**: Its static position indirectly effects adjacency—other shapes translate toward or near it in outputs (e.g., in Train 1 output, Blue and Maroon position adjacent to Yellow's y=11-13 range; in Train 2, Blue/Green overlap its x-range).

#### 5. **Red Single Pixels (p=1) and Adjacency to Non-Red Shapes**
   - **Interaction**: Single-pixel Red elements (p=1, point-like at single [x,y]) consistently position adjacent to (or at edges of) non-Red shapes' bboxes, acting as connection markers.
   - **Consistency**: In every train input and output, Red p=1 blobs are placed immediately adjacent to non-Red shapes (e.g., within 1-2 units of bbox edges; Train 1 input: Reds at [2,5] near Blue [2,3,7,8]; output: Reds at [8,6]/[12,6] between Green and Maroon. Train 2 input: Reds at [16,6]/[18,6] below Pink; output: Reds at [7,7]/[9,7]/[12,7]/[15,7] below Pink/Maroon). No Red p=1 is isolated >2 units from any non-Red shape.
   - **Effect**: Red positions respond to non-Red bbox edges, "linking" shapes (e.g., Reds fill gaps between translated shapes in outputs). Color (Red) is tied to this role—non-Red shapes never have p=1.

#### 6. **Maroon/Dark Red Shapes and Horizontal Fill Interaction**
   - **Interaction**: Maroon (or similar dark red) shapes (low pixels, wide bbox) interact with nearby Red p=1 by aligning horizontally, where Red positions extend or cap their bbox.
   - **Consistency**: In every train, Maroon (p=9 in Train 1, p=6 in Train 2) has 1-2 Red p=1 directly adjacent horizontally or vertically at bbox edges post-translation (e.g., Train 1 output: Maroon [8,7,12,9] with Reds at [9,10]/[11,10] inside x-range; Train 2 output: Maroon [12,5,15,6] with Reds at [12,7]/[15,7] below). Pixels (~6-9) suggest partial fills that "connect" via Reds.
   - **Effect**: Maroon's wide bbox (e.g., 4-5 width, low height) effects Red placement for horizontal extension, consistently forming linear assemblies.

#### Unknowns (Consistent but Unexplainable Interactions)
- **Red Pixel Count and Shape Clustering**: Red p=1 count varies (e.g., ~10-15 per example) and increases/decreases slightly across input/output, but consistently correlates with the number of non-Red shapes (one Red per edge or joint). Exact generation rule (e.g., how non-Red positions spawn new Reds) is unknown—no consistent formula ties counts directly.
- **Color-Specific Translations**: Each color (e.g., Blue -> rightward in Train 1, downward in Train 2) translates differently relative to Yellow, but the direction/magnitude effect from initial position is inconsistent (e.g., no uniform vector). This interaction exists (color affects translation path) but cannot be explained without forcing patterns.
- **No Rotation or Deformation**: All non-Red shapes avoid rotation (bbox aspect ratio preserved), interacting with grid alignment, but why this constraint applies (vs. possible rotations) is unknown.

No other connections (e.g., holes, specific silhouettes, or color-to-color direct effects without position mediation) are consistent across every example. Elements like isolated Reds or non-interacting positions were excluded as irrelevant.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:15:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with colored components (connected groups of the same non-red color, excluding reds) and red cells (value 2) that act as attachment points. The goal is to extract these components, identify reds attached to exactly one component, place the yellow (color 4) component centrally in a new output grid, and then place other components by prioritizing alignments where their attached reds match positions of already-placed reds (for "snapping" attachments), falling back to heuristic placements (e.g., by centroid, size, or scanning positions) if no matches are found, while avoiding overlaps and staying within bounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same color; reds (2) are not part of components but can be "attached" if adjacent to exactly one component (diagonals not considered for attachment).
 * Yellow (4) is always placed first, shifted to the vertical center (row n//2 - minr) with no horizontal shift (dc=0), and its attached reds become the initial "placed_reds" set for snapping future components.
 * For other components, prioritize placements that maximize the number of attached reds that land on existing placed_reds positions (best_num_match), with ties broken by minimizing Manhattan distance (abs(dr) + abs(dc)); if no matches (best_num_match == 0), fall back to heuristic placement: sort components by average row centroid (top-to-bottom), place above yellow if centroid lower, below if higher, with horizontal scanning starting from yellow's left edge, adjusting for component height/width and red positions (e.g., if bottom reds align with component maxr and >=2 reds, shift right by yellow width).
 * Heuristic fallback scans horizontally first at a fixed dy, then increments dy and scans again if needed; this can fail if the initial dy is wrong (e.g., too high/low relative to yellow).
 * Output grid starts empty (0s); placements overwrite only if no conflict (can_place_shape checks for non-zero non-matching color); reds are placed as 2s but only if in bounds.
 * Subtle: Components with no attached reds are still placed via heuristics; sorting by centroid may not always respect left-right or attachment order; the program removes yellow after finding it, sorts remaining by centroid, but doesn't handle multiple yellows or missing yellow (returns empty if no yellow).
 * Easy to miss: Reds not attached to any component are ignored; placements must not overlap different colors; the fallback dy calculation for below-yellow assumes yellow's height but may misalign if component has protruding reds (e.g., bottom_reds_row check shifts right but adjusts dy down by component height minus yellow height, which can cause vertical overlap or gap).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided): No rotation or flipping of components; assumes orthogonal placement only; n is grid size (square); empty rows/columns in input are preserved as 0 in output.
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (scanning fails); multiple components with same color (treated separately if disconnected); reds touching multiple components are unassigned; if heuristic scan exhausts bounds without placement, component is dropped (not placed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # 4-directional connectivity for components and attachments
```

```python
def find_components(grid):  # Extracts connected components per color (excludes 2s), returns list of dicts with 'color', 'cells' (list of (r,c)), 'reds' (initially empty), bounding box (minr,maxr,minc,maxc)
    # Uses DFS stack to flood-fill unvisited same-color cells; helpful for isolating blobs.
    # Returns empty list if no components.
```

```python
def find_attached_reds(grid, components):  # Assigns reds to components if exactly one adjacent component (via pos_to_comp index mapping)
    # Checks 4 directions for each red; adds to comp['reds'] only if len(touching_comps) == 1.
    # Essential for identifying "handles" for snapping; unhelpful for reds touching 0 or >1 comps (ignored).
```

```python
def can_place_shape(comp, dr, dc, out, n):  # Validates placement shift without overlap (allows same color or 0, blocks different colors)
    # Quick bound check + grid read; used in snapping and scanning.
```

```python
def place_shape(out, comp, dr, dc, n):  # Applies shift: sets cells to color, attached reds to 2 (if in bounds); returns new_reds list for updating placed_reds set
    # Core placement logic; updates output in-place; filters out-of-bounds reds.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handles component extraction and red attachment (works for training 1).
 * Training 1 passed fully: yellow placed centrally, other components snapped or heuristically placed correctly, resulting in exact match.
 * Training 2 failed: Generated output misplaces components—e.g., 8-block placed where expected has 6-block (rows 5-6 leftish vs. expected rows 4-6 left), 6-block placed partially overlapping 1's and 3's area (row 7-9 right vs. expected row 4-6 left as 6's), 3-block scattered/misaligned (rows 11-15 mixed with 2's vs. expected rows 8-12 right as solid 3's), yellow (4) at rows 11-13 but with wrong horizontal shift and missing some 2's alignments; overall, snapping prioritized wrong matches (e.g., 8's reds didn't align to yellow's placed_reds properly), and fallback heuristics caused vertical/horizontal offsets (dy too low for below components, scanning started from wrong left=dc_y=0 leading to left-side crowding).
 * Fallback heuristic buggy: For components below yellow, dy = (n//2 + yellow_height) +1 often overshoots, and bottom_reds_row adjustment subtracts comp height minus yellow height but doesn't account for yellow's placed position (dr_y shift); this dropped or mis-scanned some placements, leaving gaps (e.g., row 14 empty in generated vs. expected has nothing but positions differ).
 * Sorting by average row centroid works for top-bottom order but ignores left-right priorities or red-based chaining (e.g., if comp A must attach to B before C).
 * Snapping loop iterates over each red in comp to each placed_red, but only picks best per comp (not per-red chaining); this misses multi-step attachments.
 * find_components excludes color 2 correctly but treats all other >0 as valid (even if isolated single cells); unhelpful if puzzle has invalid colors, but seems fine.
 * No unhelpful functions: All provided (find_components, find_attached_reds, can_place_shape, place_shape) are core and helpful; main program logic is the issue (snapping/heuristic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on inferred rules: It places 9-block (likely a long horizontal with holes/reds) at rows 5-8 left-center, then 8-block (long horizontal with extensions) at rows 10-16 center-right attached via 2's, 4 (yellow?) at rows 13-16 center overlapping 8's area (but can_place_shape should block this unless same color—wait, 4 !=8, so overlap invalid, suggesting bug in validation or order), 1's scattered as attachments to 8's, 3-block at bottom-left rows 16-19 vertical, 7-block at row 16 right as horizontal. This crowds center-bottom, ignores potential top placements (e.g., empty rows 0-4 could fit smaller comps like 1's or unattached), and 2's are placed but don't chain properly (e.g., 9's 2's in row 7-9 don't snap to yellow's reds, which seem missing or unplaced centrally). Expected should start with yellow (4) at vertical center (row ~11-13 for n=26?), then snap/place others upward/downward without overlaps (e.g., 9's above if centroid low, 7's right-attached, 3's bottom without crowding 8's); generated has no central yellow visible (4's are low and partial), many empty top rows (suggests sorting/centroid failed to place top comps), and 2's in row 20 bottom not attached—likely heuristic scan exhausted bounds or wrong dy for bottom comps. Differences: Overlaps (4 on 8?), wrong vertical stacking (all piled mid-bottom vs. balanced top-bottom), missing chaining (e.g., 1's should snap to multiple placed 2's but appear loose).

[2025-10-02 03:16:03] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (the only examples with before/after states to observe interactions), the following are the only obvious, consistent connections or interactions between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (both train input/output pairs) and do not rely on solving the puzzle or inferring high-level rules. No such consistent patterns were identifiable in the test inputs alone (lacking outputs), so they are excluded from interaction analysis. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated reds with no nearby colored shapes, or properties like hole count which is always 0 and unchanged) are omitted. Specific shape details (e.g., L-shape vs. U-shape) cannot be confirmed from bbox/pixels data alone, so no shape-specific interactions are included. Overall transformation rules (e.g., why positions change) are unknown and not explained here.

- **Red single pixels ↔ Colored shapes (all non-red colors: Blue/Light Blue, Green, Yellow, Maroon/Dark Red, Orange, Pink)**:  
  Red pixels (1 pixel each) are consistently positioned adjacent to or overlapping the bounding boxes of colored shapes in inputs and outputs. Their relative positions to the attached shape remain consistent during changes (e.g., a red below a shape in input stays below it in output after position shift). This suggests reds act as attached "tips" or "accents" that move with the shape, affecting its effective silhouette or extension. Examples:  
  - In Train 1: Green shape ([1,18,5,19]) has reds directly below at y=20; after shift to [8,4,12,5], reds shift to directly below at y=6. Similarly for Blue, Maroon, Orange.  
  - In Train 2: Pink shape ([16,3,18,5]) has adjacent reds at (16,6)/(18,6); after shift to [7,4,9,6], reds shift to (7,7)/(9,7). Similarly for Blue, Green, Maroon.  
  No other colors (e.g., no self-contained reds without a nearby colored shape) show this attachment consistently.

- **Position of colored shape → Position of attached red pixels**:  
  When a colored shape's bbox changes (translation observed in both trains), the positions of its attached red pixels change by the same delta (x/y offset), preserving adjacency. This interaction is consistent for all moving shapes but does not apply to static ones. Pixel count of reds remains 1 (unchanged). Examples as above; no exceptions across trains.

- **Yellow shape properties → Stationary behavior**:  
  The Yellow shape (bbox roughly [9-12,11-14], pixels 9) consistently does not change position, size, or attached reds between input and output in both trains. Its attached reds (e.g., right-side or below) also remain fixed relative to it and the grid. This implies no interaction causing movement for Yellow, unlike other colors which translate. No other shape shows this consistent stationarity.

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color effects like Green affecting Blue position, or bbox width/height changing based on pixels) are consistent across both train examples—many vary (e.g., different translation deltas, occasional extra reds not clearly attached). Specific shape transformations (e.g., rotation vs. pure translation) are unknown due to limited bbox detail. No consistent interactions involving holes (always 0) or pixels count changes (stable per color).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 03:17:28] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent colors or blobs, and the task is to extract connected components (blobs of the same non-2 color, including adjacent 2's as connectors or wildcards) from an input grid and rearrange them into a new output grid by stacking them vertically from top to bottom with horizontal centering, while handling special cases for components touching the top or bottom edges and avoiding overlaps by shifting downward or horizontally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-directional (up, down, left, right) flood fill for cells of the same color (non-2), and must include all adjacent 2's (which act as bridges or attachments to the main blob, even if not same color).
 * Components touching the bottom edge (max row == n-1) should be placed higher up in the output (e.g., starting around row 4-5), while top-touching components (min row == 0) are placed lower (e.g., row 7-8), suggesting an inversion or "flipping" of edge-touching blobs to simulate a puzzle like stacking or inverting layers.
 * Remaining components are placed in order of their original minimum row (ascending), centered horizontally ((n - width)//2), and shifted downward (dy +=1) if they overlap with already placed content; horizontal shifts (dx adjustments) are a fallback but often lead to misalignment if overused.
 * 2's are neutral/empty in isolation but get absorbed into adjacent non-2 components; standalone 2's or unabsorbed 2's may need separate handling, but the program assumes they attach only during flood fill.
 * Overlap detection must check if target cell is occupied by a different value (out[nr][nc] != 0 and != val), allowing same-color overlaps but preventing conflicts; however, vertical packing can be tight, sometimes allowing row overlaps if shapes interlock.
 * Grid size is fixed (e.g., 22x22 for train1, 26x26? for test), with lots of leading/trailing 0's, implying the output should be sparse and centered overall.
 * Subtle: After placing special components, remove them from the list to avoid re-placement; sorting by original min row ensures stable ordering, but dy resets and dx shifts can cause cascading misplacements if the initial dy=0 assumption fails early.
 * Potential for shape distortion: When placing, relative positions are preserved (nr = start_r + (r - min_r_comp)), but if components have irregular shapes (e.g., with holes or protrusions), centering based on min/max col may clip or misalign protrusions.
 * 0's are background/empty; output must fill only where components are placed, leaving rest as 0.
 * Puzzle may involve "inverting" or "reflecting" the grid's vertical structure, as bottom-touching goes to top in output, suggesting a flow or stacking mechanic like in a physics simulation or layer puzzle.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def flood(start_i: int, start_j: int, c: int, g: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    component = []
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        if visited[i][j] or g[i][j] != c:
            continue
        visited[i][j] = True
        component.append((i, j, c))
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == c:
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```
(This flood fill is useful for extracting core same-color components accurately.)

```python
def add_adjacent_twos(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    adj_twos = set()
    for i, j, _ in component:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and g[ni][nj] == 2 and (ni, nj) not in adj_twos:
                adj_twos.add((ni, nj))
                component.append((ni, nj, 2))
    return component
```
(This attaches 2's correctly to components, which is key for shape integrity, but note it only adds once per component and doesn't recurse for chained 2's.)

```python
def place_component(comp: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], start_r: int, out: List[List[int]], n: int):
    if not comp:
        return
    min_r_comp = min(r for r, _, _ in comp)
    min_c = min(c for _, c, _ in comp)

(This placement logic with relative offsets and centering is helpful but needs better overlap avoidance integration.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly implements flood fill for components and attachment of adjacent 2's, which preserves blob shapes including connectors, and identifies top/bottom-touching components accurately.
 * It worked partially for horizontal centering (target_left = (n - w)//2) and relative positioning within components, as seen in the generated outputs where blobs maintain their internal structure (e.g., 8's shapes in train1).
 * However, placement of special components (bottom at row 4, top at row 7) is too rigid and doesn't adapt to grid size or other components, leading to overlaps or gaps; in train1, bottom_comp (likely the 1's or 4's) is placed too low, causing the 8's to appear in row 8 instead of row 7 as expected.
 * Remaining components sorting by min_r is good, but the overlap avoidance loop (dy +=1, reset if too low, then dx +=1) is flawed—it doesn't check full height (h) before placing, causes infinite-like shifts in dense cases, and doesn't try multiple dy/dx combinations efficiently, resulting in misplacements like the 3's and 5's in train1 being scattered (e.g., 3's in row 4 expected but generated in row 18-20).
 * In train1, generated output has 8's correctly shaped but shifted right and down (rows 8-10 vs expected 7-9), 1's fragmented (row 12-18 with extras), and bottom elements like 4's/3's inverted wrong (generated row 17-20 vs expected row 4/18); specifically, expected has 3's blob at top (row4-5) which generated misses entirely in that position, and 5's/1's interlocking at bottom which generated flattens.
 * In train2, generated places 6's correctly at top but without adjacent 8's integration (expected merges 6's and 8's starting row5), 3's/1's/4's jumbled mid-grid (e.g., generated row13 has 4's/1's mixed wrong vs expected row8-13 with clean 1's bar and 3's), and bottom 8's missing (generated has them low but detached); unknown why 2's bridges fail to connect 8's properly here.
 * Removal of special components after placement works (avoids duplicates), but the fallback dx shift after dy overflow is unhelpful as it often pushes components off-center without resolving vertical packing, leading to empty rows (e.g., rows 0-6 empty in train2 generated vs expected starting row4).
 * The add_adjacent_twos function is helpful but limited— it adds 2's only to the initial component without recursing if 2's connect multiple blobs, potentially missing chained attachments; not broken but incomplete for complex 2-networks.
 * Overall, the program understands component extraction (helpful for blob isolation) but fails on packing logic, with no training example passing due to poor overlap handling and fixed start rows (4 and 7) that don't scale (e.g., train1 22x22 vs train2 similar but different densities).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (26x26 grid) does not look correct, as it places components in a scattered, non-stacked manner: e.g., small 8's/2's at top (rows1-3) but isolated, large 8's/9's/4's mid-grid (rows8-16) with awkward 2's intrusions, and bottom 1's/3's/7's (rows20-25) not centered or packed tightly, leaving huge empty spaces (rows3-7 empty).
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training: no clear inversion of edge-touchers (e.g., likely bottom 7's blob should be high up like train1's 3's, but generated low at row21-22), 2's are over-absorbed (e.g., row15 has 2's splitting 9's/4's unnaturally vs expected clean merges), and overall vertical stacking is broken with overlaps ignored (e.g., row13 9's/2's overlap potential but forced).
 * Components like the large 7's bar at row21 seem detached from 3's above, unlike training where bottom-touchers invert to top; the right-side placements (e.g., 7's cols21-26) are off-center, suggesting dx shift failed without proper width calc for irregular shapes.
 * 9's blob (rows12-16) is centered but shifted down too far, blocking potential top placements for edge components; unknown why 1's are in a thin vertical bar (rows17-20) instead of a wide base like expected interlocking in trains.
 * Empty rows and fragmented 2's (e.g., row0 all 0's, row23-25 sparse) indicate incomplete packing—test likely needs tighter vertical flow starting from row0 or4, but generated wastes space, making it look like a failed stacking rather than a solved puzzle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual rearrangement puzzle where the input grid contains connected components (blobs or shapes) of numbered cells (1-9, excluding 2's which act as connectors or extensions), and the goal is to extract these components, optionally augment them with adjacent or implied 2's based on touching top/bottom edges, order them by specific criteria (e.g., bottom-touching, top-touching, centroid height), and place them into a new empty grid in a stacked, centered manner with collision avoidance and horizontal shifts to form a coherent output image, likely representing a reorganized diagram or scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are found via flood fill for cells >0 and !=2, treating same-number adjacent (4-directional) cells as one object; 2's are not part of main components but can be attached if adjacent and below/above the main blob.
 * 2's above the minimum row of a main component (upper 2's) indicate "top touch" and may add an extra score or extension count, but are not included in the component itself; only unique upper 2's are counted.
 * Attached lower 2's (below or at min row) are flood-filled and added to the component if connected via 2's, extending the shape downward; this affects bottom-touch detection (if max row >= n-2).
 * For top-touching components, add "extra" 2's below the bottom row of the main component, in columns matching the bottom-most row's columns (up to the number of unique upper 2's), sorted by column to align left-to-right.
 * Ordering: Prioritize bottom-touching components first (take at most 1), then top-touching (at most 1), then remaining sorted by centroid row (lower centroid first?); if no top-touch, select the top-most (min min_r_main) as first.
 * Placement: Start at baseline row 4, center horizontally ((n - width)//2), use small horizontal shift (2) for top-touch components, larger (10) for others; for subsequent placements, search for lowest possible dy (tight packing above current max_r), preferring rightmost fitting dx within shift range to avoid overlaps; fallback to below current_max_r if no fit.
 * Subtleties: Components must be translated to relative coordinates from their collective min_r/min_c (including attached/extra 2's); overlaps are forbidden (out[nr][nc] must be 0); n=22 for all grids; 0's are empty; output must exactly match expected shapes/positions, including all 2's and numbers; missing or extra cells (e.g., unplaced components or wrong augmentations) cause failure.
 * Easy to miss: Upper 2's only count if strictly above min_r_main and adjacent; extra 2's for top-touch are placed exactly one row below the main's bottom, only in bottom-row columns (limited by upper_count); centroid is average row of main_comp only (ignores attached 2's); bottom-touch uses extended max_r with attached but not extra; if multiple bottom/top, only first is prioritized (unspecified tiebreaker); empty components skipped; all_cells_abs may be empty but fallback to main mins.
 * General: Preserve original values (e.g., 3's stay 3); no rotation/scaling; grid is square (22x22); puzzle likely assembles a larger scene (e.g., figures, bars, bases) where order creates narrative (bottom foundations, top elements, fillers).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single submission shown) correctly identifies and floods main components excluding 2's, augments with lower attached 2's via separate flood, and adds extra 2's for top-touch based on upper count and bottom columns.
 * Train 1: Generated output places 3's,5's,1's,8's,2's in wrong positions/rows (e.g., 3's high up with 5's adjacent but not matching expected stacked layout starting at row 4 with 3's/2's/8's/2's then lower 4/1/5 groups); misses many components (no 4's at all, wrong 1's shape, extra/missing 2's); 8's and 2's partially match but shifted; overall too sparse and high-placed, ignoring expected tight low packing.
 * Train 1: Bottom-touch detection likely wrong (e.g., 5's or 1's should extend with 2's to touch bottom?); ordering fails (starts with wrong first component, centroids not sorting fillers correctly); placement search prefers wrong dy/dx (e.g., not tight enough, wrong shift for top-touch).
 * Train 2: Generated output places 8's and 6's high, then 4's/2's mid, but misses most components (no 1's,3's at all; sparse 4's without extensions); expected has interleaved 6/8/2/1/3/4/2's in a complex mid-low stack; attachment of 2's to 4's wrong (shows isolated 2's); ordering ignores top/bottom touches (6's top-touch? 4's bottom?).
 * Train 2: Placement fallback too early (leaves bottom empty); shift logic pushes things right but not enough to fit all; rel_comp min_r_all incorrect for augmented shapes.
 * General issues: Only processes non-2 >0, but may skip implied components; upper_count over/under-counts if non-adjacent; extra 2's placed but not flood-connected; order takes [:1] for multiples but may pick wrong one; search for best_dy prefers low but not always tight (inf fallback too high); no handling for wide components overflowing center+shift.
 * Function `flood` is helpful and correct for isolation.
 * Function `process_component` is mostly helpful but buggy in attached 2's stack init (sets visited early, may miss some); extra_abs logic good but num=min(upper,len(bottom)) may under-add.
 * Function `place` is helpful and correct.
 * Overall program in `program` has good structure (components list, ordering, placement loop) but fails on integration (wrong order/positions lead to missing elements, overlaps not detected properly in search).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places a 3-blob (possibly top-touch with extras?) high up (rows 0-3) adjacent to a 9-blob, then 8's mid (rows 4-8) with isolated 2 below, leaving most of the grid empty below row 8; this is too top-heavy and sparse, missing likely lower components (e.g., no 1's,4's,5's,6's,7's visible, assuming test has more numbers).
 * Expected likely mirrors training: A stacked layout starting low (baseline ~4) with bottom-touch bases (e.g., extended 9's or 8's touching near row 20), then mid fillers, top elements with 2's connectors; current output ignores tight packing (huge empty space below), wrong ordering (3's and 9's first but not bottom-touch), and incomplete extraction (only 2-3 components placed, others dropped?); 3's shape augmented wrong (extra 3's? but shows connected); 8's missing parts (incomplete flood?); no horizontal alignment/collision avoidance working (9's overhang right).
 * To handle test: Ensure all components extracted/placed (e.g., if test has more blobs like train1/2); adjust ordering to prioritize true bottom-touch (with attached max_r); increase shift range or change dx preference (min abs instead of max?); verify 2's attachment includes all connected even non-adjacent starts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (blobs) of colored numbers (non-2 values) from an input grid, augmenting them with attached 2's (likely representing connectors or fillers) under specific rules (e.g., only lower attachments, conditional extras based on upper 2's and edge touches), normalizing their relative shapes, ordering them by properties like centroid and special flags (bottom-touching or top-edge-touching), and then packing them into a new output grid with prioritized placement (e.g., bottom components low, top high, others packed with shifts to avoid conflicts while allowing overlaps of same values).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected groups of the same non-2 positive value using 4-directional flood fill; 2's are ignored for main components but can be attached or added conditionally.
 * For each component: Compute min/max rows/cols; count unique upper 2's (above min row) and check if they touch row 0 (top edge); flood-fill attach only lower 2's (row >= min row, connected via 2's); compute centroid (average row of main cells); flag bottom-touch if max row (including attached) >= n-2; if top-edge-touch, add extra 2's below the main bottom in up to upper_count columns (sorted, starting from leftmost bottom cols).
 * Normalize to relative coords (shift to (0,0) min); combine main + attached + extras into rel_comp.
 * Ordering: Identify unique bottom-touch (highest centroid) and top-edge-touch (lowest centroid) components first; remove them; sort remaining by descending centroid (higher rows first, i.e., "bottom-up" placement?); place bottom at fixed dy=4, top at current_max_r+1, others starting from max(4, current_max_r - allowance=4) with vertical increments and horizontal center/right shifts (up to 10) if center conflicts.
 * Placement allows overwriting with same value or empty (0), but rejects different values; track current_max_r for stacking; out-of-bounds cells are skipped.
 * Subtleties: Upper 2's are just counted/set for conditions but not attached to rel_comp; extra 2's only if top-edge-touch and placed exactly one row below main bottom in specific cols; bottom flag uses max_r including attached; components with no cells skipped; n=22 for train1/2, 26 for test; overlaps must preserve values exactly (no mixing different numbers).
 * Potential misses: Flood fill might over/under-connect if 2's bridge mains incorrectly (but code excludes 2's from main); extra 2's col selection uses sorted bottom cols, limited by min(upper_count, bottom_cols); placement shifts only right from center, no left; fixed dy=4 for bottom might be too low/high; allowance=4 for packing start might cause overlaps or gaps; centroid is row-only (ignores cols); multiple bottom/top picks highest/lowest centroid if ties.
 * All attempts must handle empty rows/cols in output; preserve exact shapes/colors; no rotation/flipping; 0's are background.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies and extracts main components via flood fill (helpful for isolating blobs like the 8's, 3's, etc.), computes centroids and relative shapes, and attempts ordered packing with conflict checks and shifts.
 * What worked: Component extraction seems accurate (e.g., groups 8's together, 3's, 4's); relative normalization shifts to (0,0); placement logic avoids hard conflicts by allowing same-val overlaps; tracks current_max_r for stacking.
 * What didn't work: Both training examples are incorrect, with major misplacements and missing/incorrect 2 attachments. In Train 1: Generated places 8's high (row1-3) but expected lower (row7-9); 3's fragmented/misattached (row4-5 with wrong 2's/5's overlap); 4's low but shifted wrong (includes extra 3's/1's); 1's and 5's scattered/missing connections; no top/bottom specials seem applied correctly (e.g., expected bottom 1's/5's low, but generated has them mid). Differences: Generated has 8's too high, 2's attached to wrong blobs (e.g., under 8's but expected under 3's/4's), 5's partial; unknown why extras/attachments flood wrong (perhaps lower 2's overconnect across components).
 * In Train 2: Generated packs 8's/6's/1's/3's/4's high/mid but ignores many connections/2's; e.g., 6's partial (missing full shape), 3's right but no attachments, 4's absent/low; expected has 6's top, 8's mid with 2's, 1's/3's/4's lower with 2's bridging. Differences: Generated misses lower packing (all crammed rows4-8, empty below); no 2's placed at all; components like 4's/1's fragmented or omitted; unknown why top/bottom flags failed (e.g., expected bottom 4's/3's low).
 * process_component likely buggy: Attached 2's might flood too broadly (connecting unrelated 2's); extras added wrong cols/rows (e.g., Train1 generated extras under 8's but expected elsewhere); bottom dy=4 too rigid (causes overlaps); shifts only right, no left/center retry; allowance=4 too small, causes vertical gaps/overlaps.
 * get_all_processed and main program helpful for orchestration but fail on ordering (e.g., bottom/top not prioritized correctly, leading to high placement of low-centroid items).
 * No unhelpful functions; all aim at puzzle but execution errs (e.g., flood is solid, but integration with 2's handling broken).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears jumbled and incomplete, with components partially placed but misaligned, missing connections, and no coherent packing (e.g., 8's scattered across rows1-10 without full shape, 9's fragmented in rows8-11, 7's/4's clumped mid but overlapping wrong like 3's into 2's area, 1's trailing low/right but disconnected; many empty rows below despite space). Expected likely a stacked arrangement: top-edge items high (e.g., perhaps 8's or 9's up with upper 2's implied), bottom-touch low (e.g., 1's/4's at bottom with attached 2's), others packed mid by descending centroid, with 2's bridging/filling per rules (e.g., extras under top-touch if row0 2's present). Differences: No 2's placed systematically (only sparse, e.g., row5 col15); shapes distorted (e.g., 8's not contiguous full blob); right-side crowding (7's/4's/1's shifted far); ignores potential bottom flag for low 1's; overall lacks vertical spacing/stacking, looks like failed shift/packing (e.g., dy starts too low, shifts push off-center without resolving conflicts). Unknown why 3's/9's partial, but clearly doesn't match expected clean, rule-based rearrangement.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of connected components (blobs or shapes) from an input grid, where each component consists of cells with the same positive integer value (representing distinct objects or colors), followed by normalizing their relative shapes, sorting them based on their original positions in the input (likely by row centroid to preserve top-to-bottom order), and reassembling them into a new output grid by placing them without overlap in a specific order and position (e.g., packing from the top-left available space, but potentially starting from a baseline row or in sorted order to match expected layouts with leading zero rows).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components must be connected orthogonally (4 directions: up, down, left, right) and only cells with the *exact same value* (>0) should be grouped together—do not merge different values, even if adjacent, as this creates invalid oversized or hybrid shapes.
 * Normalize shapes relative to the minimum row and column in each component to get a "bounding box" origin at (0,0), preserving the internal structure and values.
 * Compute a centroid (e.g., average row position) for sorting; sort components by *increasing* centroid row (top-first in original grid) rather than decreasing, as the current decreasing sort (bottom-first) leads to reversed order in output.
 * Placement must avoid overlaps: when placing a shape, check that target cells are empty (0) or match the value (though ideally empty since shapes are distinct); try positions starting from top-left (smallest row, then smallest column) within bounds, but the expected outputs have leading zero rows (e.g., rows 0-3 empty in train1), suggesting shapes are packed starting from a specific baseline (e.g., row 4) or only after sorting and fitting without forcing top placement.
 * Output grid is same size as input (n x n), initialized to zeros; all original shapes must be placed exactly, without rotation, scaling, or modification, and unused areas remain 0.
 * Subtle: Components may have irregular shapes (e.g., spaced cells like "E" or "H" forms in expected), holes aren't mentioned but shouldn't affect connectivity; ensure no out-of-bounds placement; if a shape can't fit in a "preferred" spot, fallback to bottom-left may overwrite or misplace, but expecteds suggest all fit cleanly when ordered correctly.
 * Grids seem square (e.g., 22x22 for train1/2, possibly 26x26 for test based on line lengths); values are small positives (1-9), zeros are empty.
 * Potential for multiple components of same value? Treat as separate if not connected.
 * Ordering impacts placement: wrong sort leads to shapes appearing in incorrect vertical sequence (e.g., bottom shapes at top of output).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Core issue: find_components merges adjacent cells of different values into single components (e.g., 3's connected to 2's), leading to distorted shapes that don't match expecteds (e.g., in train1 generated, hybrid 3-2-5-4-1 blobs at top; in train2, mixed 8-2-1-3-4-6; test has jumbled 3-2-7-9-4-1-8).
 * Sorting by decreasing centroid (-x[0]) places bottom-original shapes first/at top of output, but expecteds have top-original shapes higher (e.g., train1 expected starts with horizontal 3's at row4, likely a top shape; train2 expected has 6's at row4, then 8's/2's/1's/3's/4's lower—suggests increasing sort for top-first placement).
 * Placement loop starts from top (sr=0), filling immediately, causing no leading zero rows (e.g., train1 generated fills row0 with 3's/2's/5's; expecteds have rows 0-3 zero); fallback to bottom-left (sr=n-height) sometimes used but overwrites or mispositions when can't place (e.g., test generated has shapes crammed at top rows 0-8, ignoring potential baseline).
 * Overlap check is partially correct (avoids different values), but since components are wrong, it leads to partial placements or skips; expecteds have no overlaps and exact shape preservation (e.g., train1 expected has isolated "E"-like 8's, spaced 3's/2's, L-shaped 4's with 1's/2's/5's—no merging).
 * get_rel_shape, get_centroid, get_dimensions are helpful and correct for normalization/sizing/sorting.
 * Overall program structure (extract -> sort -> place sequentially) is a good skeleton, but broken by connectivity and sort/placement logic; no rotation or value changes attempted (correct, as expecteds preserve them).
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has dense top-packed hybrids (e.g., row0: 3's then 2/5's; row3: 8's/5's/4's/1's), expected has clean separate shapes lower (e.g., row4: 3's row; row5: spaced 3's; row7: 8's row; row12: 4's with attachments; unknown why baseline at row4, perhaps implicit padding or sort order).
 * Train2 mismatches: generated mixes at top (row0: 8's/2's/6's; row1: 8's/1's/3's/4's/6's), expected has separate lower (row4: 6's; row5: spaced 6's/8's; row8: spaced 2's/1's/3's; row13: 4's—reversed order effect).
 * Test output: Does not look correct—shapes are merged/hybrid (e.g., row0 starts with 3's/2's; row1 has 7's block with 4's/2's/1's/8's mixed; row5 has 8's block with 2's/9's), placed densely at top (rows 0-8 filled, rest zero), ignoring leading zeros and exact separations; expecteds suggest clean, separate components packed lower/mid-grid in original order (likely top-first), so this is invalid (e.g., 7/9 blocks should be isolated, not adjacent to 4's/1's unless same-value connected, which they're not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt—it's a messy top-packed grid with merged shapes (e.g., 3's adjacent to 2's in row0, 7's block bleeding into 4's/1's/8's in rows1-2), no leading zero rows, and incomplete lower placement (rows9+ all zero, suggesting failed placements or early stops); this mismatches expected patterns from training (clean, separate same-value blobs, starting after zero rows ~row4, in sorted order without hybrids).
 * Likely wrong due to same-value connectivity bug (merges distinct objects like 3-2, 7-4-1-8) and top-first placement without padding/baseline, causing overlap avoidance failures; to handle test, fix to same-value components, sort increasing centroid, and add baseline start (e.g., sr from 4) or pack only after all zeros above.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where connected components of non-2 values (representing "main" objects like blobs or shapes of numbers 1,3,4,5,6,8,9) must be extracted, augmented with adjacent or connected 2's (acting as attachments or extensions), ordered by specific rules involving centroids and touch flags, and then rearranged into a new output grid starting from row 4 (index 4), centered horizontally, with vertical stacking and minor shifts to avoid overlaps, while preserving relative shapes and handling special cases for top-touching (low row) and bottom-touching (high row) components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Main components are connected groups of the same positive integer (non-2, non-0) using 4-directional flood fill; ignore 0's (empty) and 2's (special connectors) during extraction.
 * 2's are not main components but must be attached if they form connected groups (via other 2's) that touch any cell of a main component; this expands the component shape without changing the main value.
 * For top-touching components (those with attached 2's above the minimum row of the main part), add extra virtual 2's below the main component's bottom row, matching the number of upper 2's (up to the width of the bottom row's columns), placed in sorted column order; this seems to "balance" or extend the shape downward for placement rules.
 * Compute properties like relative normalized shape (shifted to (0,0) origin), centroid (average row for vertical positioning/ordering), height/width of full shape (main + attached + extra 2's), and flags for top-touch (any 2 above min main row) and bottom-touch (full shape reaches near grid bottom, e.g., max row >= n-2).
 * Ordering: Prioritize the single bottom-touch component with the highest (deepest) centroid first; then non-touch components by increasing centroid; finally the single top-touch component with the lowest (shallowest) centroid last; this creates a specific sequence like bottom-heavy -> middle -> top-light.
 * Placement starts at row 4 (0-indexed), centered horizontally ((n - w)//2); try tight vertical packing below the current max occupied row, then scan downward from row 4 with small horizontal shifts (±1 to ±5) if conflicts (defined as placing over non-empty non-matching value); fallback to bottom of grid if unplaceable; overlaps allow same-value or empty (0), but not different values.
 * Grid size is square (n x n), outputs are n x n with 0's elsewhere; subtle: components may span irregularly, 2's can connect diagonally? No, 4-directional only; extra 2's are virtual (not from input) and only for top-touch balancing; ignore isolated 2's or 0's entirely.
 * Easy to miss: Centroid is row-only (vertical bias for ordering); relative shape includes all parts (main, attached, extra); placement skips out-of-bounds cells; bottom-touch flag uses full shape max row vs. grid bottom; ordering assumes at most one bottom/top per category (code picks max/min if multiple).
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle varying grid sizes (22x22 in training, 26x26 in test?); components can be sparse/irregular (e.g., not solid blocks); 2's might form bridges or extensions that change effective height/width/centroid; ensure no overwriting of different values during placement; top-touch extra 2's use bottom row's columns (sorted) for positioning, limiting to min(upper_count, bottom_width).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly implements component extraction via flood fill and 2-attachment via seed flooding, which identifies main shapes and extensions accurately (e.g., groups 5's together, attaches nearby 2's).
 * Ordering by bottom-touch (highest centroid) first, then ascending centroid, top-touch (lowest) last works conceptually but fails in practice due to miscomputed centroids or flags, leading to wrong sequence (e.g., in Train 1, 8's placed low but expected higher; 5's/1's misplaced).
 * Placement logic starting at row 4 with centering and shifts avoids some overlaps but generates incorrect layouts: in Train 1, generated has 5's/3's/1's jammed in row 4-5 with scattered 2's/8's below, but expected spreads 3's/8's higher (rows 4-7), adds 4's/1's/5's lower (rows 11-17) in different shapes; unknown why 5's appear extended incorrectly or 4's missing entirely.
 * In Train 2, generated places 6's/8's/4's compactly in rows 4-7 with some 2's, but expected separates 6's higher (rows 4-7), interleaves 8's/1's/3's/4's lower (rows 8-13) with more precise 2-placements; misses isolating certain components or wrong attachment (e.g., extra 2's not added for top-touch 6's?).
 * compute_component_properties adds extra 2's for top-touch but may over/under-count upper_set or misplace extras (e.g., Train 1 generated has no extras visible, but expected has balanced shapes like extended 1's/5's).
 * can_place/do_place handle conflicts by allowing same-value/0 but not others, which is correct, but fallback to bottom causes overcrowding; tight dy_try often fails due to h/w miscalc from irregular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant (flood/extract/attach/properties/placement); none are broken per se, but properties dict may have centroid bug (uses full cells including 2's/extras, but perhaps should weight main only? unknown).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places a 9-shape (likely main 9's with attached 2's) in rows 4-8 centered-leftish, an irregular 3/2 mix below it in row 7-8 overlapping slightly, and a wide 8-shape with trailing 2's in rows 9-13, but this seems too compact and left-biased compared to training expectations of more vertical spread starting row 4, centered, with distinct stacking (e.g., expected might separate 9's high, 3's mid, 8's low with balanced extras/attachments).
 * Missing potential top-touch handling: the 9's have 2's above/inline (row 6-7), suggesting top-touch, so extras should add 2's below, but generated lacks visible downward extension; 8's at bottom may be bottom-touch but not prioritized first.
 * 2's are scattered (e.g., row 5 col15, row12 col14), possibly from attachments, but don't form expected bridges or balances; overall, layout ignores ordering subtlety (e.g., if 8's are bottom-touch, they should place first/lowest, but here they're mid-low); unknown if grid size (26x26?) affects centering ((26-w)//2), leading to left shift.
 * Does not make sense as correct: Unlike expected training outputs' clean, separated shapes (e.g., Train 1's distinct 3/8/4/1/5 blocks), test generated has overlapping/jumbled 3/2/8 areas (rows 7-8), suggesting failed can_place shifts or wrong relative_comp normalization.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual assembly puzzle where the input grid contains disconnected colored components (non-red pixels representing puzzle pieces) and red pixels (acting as connectors or attachment points). The goal is to identify these components, determine valid attachment points via reds, and reassemble them into a coherent structure (e.g., a train-like vehicle) by translating and placing them relative to a central "yellow" (color 4) base piece, using rules for vertical stacking above, side attachments on left/right, and horizontal chaining to the right.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected groups of the same non-red color; reds (color 2) are not part of components but serve as exclusive attachment points— a red is "attached" to a component only if all its non-red neighbors belong to that single component (no sharing across components).
 * Yellow (color 4) is the mandatory base; if absent, output an empty grid. Place it first at its original position, then attach others relative to it.
 * Vertical attachments (above yellow or in chains): Require a "top bar" on the lower piece (a full contiguous row of pixels at its top, without gaps) and "bottom two reds" on the upper piece (exactly two reds at the bottom row, separated by a distance that the lower bar can "span" — bar length >= distance between reds +1). Chains are built by recursively stacking pieces that can attach this way, preferring longer chains or better spans (minimal overhang).
 * Side attachments (left/right of yellow's second row): Use chains with a single "side bottom red" at the bottom row (left side: red at column 0 of bottom; right side: red at max column of bottom). For left chain, attach via its right-side red to yellow's left edge (column min_c -1) at row min_r +1; for right chain, attach via left-side red to yellow's right edge (max_c +1). Sort chains by color ascending to assign lowest color to left, next to right.
 * Horizontal attachments (right of yellow): Chain remaining pieces sequentially, attaching via top bar to the previous piece's right edge (often at a "bottom" level like row +1 per step, or using right-side reds if present at top row for level continuation; if no right red at top, drop to next row). In examples, this often involves single-red or no-red attachments, and may include reds placed but not always used for spanning.
 * Subtleties: Reds are placed in output but don't connect visually— they indicate attachment validity. Attachments must align exactly (no rotation, only translation). Chains should be maximal/non-overlapping, built bottom-up. In examples, not all pieces attach (e.g., some remain unplaced if no valid connector). Yellow's second row is key for side/horizontal starts, even without reds there. Overlaps are forbidden (new_grid starts empty, placements overwrite 0 only). Grids are 22x22 in examples, but general. Bugs like unpacking None (e.g., missing top_bar or bottom_two_red) cause crashes— always check for None before unpacking.
 * Edge cases: Components with no valid bars/reds can't attach. Multiple chains possible, but select best (longest, closest span). Horizontal may zigzag rows (e.g., +1 row per piece if no level-holding red). Colors are unique per component in examples, but sort by color for ordering. Unattached pieces (e.g., isolated) stay unplaced.

    return attached
```
Correctly finds exclusive reds attached to one component; crucial for connectors, handles sharing prevention.

```python
def get_component_bbox(comp: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, c in comp]
    cs = [c for r, c in comp]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
Simple bounding box; useful for translation calculations.

```python
def get_top_bar(comp: Set[Tuple[int, int]], min_c: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    min_r, max_r, _, max_c = get_component_bbox(comp)
    top_row_cs = set(c - min_c for r, c in comp if r == min_r)
    if top_row_cs:
        min_top = min(top_row_cs)
        max_top = max(top_row_cs)
        length = max_top - min_top + 1
        if length == len(top_row_cs):  # No gaps
            return min_top, max_top, length
    return None
```
Detects gap-free top row for spanning; helpful but assumes relative to min_c—works for vertical attachments.

```python
def get_bottom_two_red(reds: Set[Tuple[int, int]], comp_min_r: int, comp_min_c: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    bottom_rel_r = -1  # Adjust to actual max_r +1 if needed
    max_r = max(r for r, c in reds)
    bottom_reds = [(r - comp_min_r, c - comp_min_c) for r, c in reds if r == max_r]
    if len(bottom_reds) == 2:
        rc1, rc2 = sorted(bottom_reds, key=lambda x: x[1])
        dist = rc2[1] - rc1[1]
        return max_r - comp_min_r, rc1[1], rc2[1], dist
    return None
```
Identifies exactly two bottom reds for vertical ports; key for stacking, but buggy (uses -1 rel_r, assumes max_r is bottom).

```python
def can_span(dist: int, bar_length: int) -> bool:
    return bar_length >= dist + 1
```
Simple span check; correct and essential for vertical validation.

```python
def translate_set(pos: Set[Tuple[int, int]], dr: int, dc: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {(r + dr, c + dc) for r, c in pos}

def place_pixels(grid: List[List[int]], pos: Set[Tuple[int, int]], color: int):
    for r, c in pos:
        if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]):
            grid[r][c] = color
```
Basic translation and placement; bounds-checked, useful but doesn't handle overlaps (assumes no conflicts).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt; component extraction (find_connected_components, get_attached_reds) works correctly in identifying pieces and exclusive reds, as seen in partial placements matching input positions before translation.
 * Vertical chain building (build_vertical_chains, can_attach_upper) conceptually grasps stacking via bars and two-red bottoms but fails in recursion (recurse function builds all subsets, not just valid chains; no filtering for disjoint/maximal). In train1, no upper chain attached (yellow top_bar detected but no matching chain), leading to missing 8 and 3 above. In train2, partial vertical (6 placed wrong).
 * Side attachments partially work: In train1, detected side reds but placement logic flips left/right (uses right red for left chain, but target_c = min_c -1 misaligns; 5 placed but at wrong row/col, and 3 not as side). In train2, no sides detected/placed.
 * Horizontal chaining fails: In train1, places 3 and 1 wrong (3 under yellow instead of right; 1 fragmented and row-dropped incorrectly, missing full bar at bottom). In train2, places 1 and 3 horizontally but misaligned (1 not full row, 3 shifted left). Update current_attach_row/col logic doesn't handle "drop +1 row per piece without top red" properly, and right_red_rel check assumes bottom but needs top-level for continuation.
 * get_side_bottom_red is broken/not helpful: Hardcodes bottom_rel_r = h-1 but filters for side cols only; returns None often if red not exactly at bottom (e.g., train1 right red for horizontal is at row+1, not bottom). Doesn't generalize to any row for horizontal.
 * get_bottom_two_red buggy: rel_r hardcoded -1, uses actual max_r from reds (assumes reds define bottom, but comp bbox needed); unpacking fails if None, causing test error.
 * build_vertical_chains recurse includes self-loops (i == current_bottom_idx skip insufficient) and doesn't enforce position disjointness, leading to overlapping/invalid chains.
 * Yellow handling good (placed correctly), but second_row assumes +1 without checking structure; in train1, horizontal starts at yellow_max_c but ignores if yellow has right red (train1 has none, but expected attaches without).
 * Overall, placements start from original positions then translate wrong (dr/dc calcs use rel ports but ignore full bbox shifts); no overlap checks. Train1 generated has yellow/reds partial, 8/3/1/5 misplaced or fragmented (e.g., 3 at wrong height, 1 not contiguous bar, 5 shifted right with extra 2). Train2 has 6/8/1/3/5 wrong (6 left of yellow instead of above/right mix, 8 not attached, 1/3 horizontal but row-misaligned, 5 missing). Differences unknown for some (e.g., why 3 in train1 at row12 col12-16 instead of expected row17 col10-14 bar).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error ("cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object"), likely from unpacking None in get_top_bar or get_bottom_two_red/get_side_bottom_red during chain building or placement (e.g., a component lacks required bar/reds, causing None unpack in for-loops like bottom_port = get_bottom_two_red(...); if bottom_port: _,_,_,dist = bottom_port).
 * This does not look correct— the program crashes instead of producing a valid grid, indicating unhandled cases (e.g., test may have components without top bars or single reds, breaking assumptions). Expected output unknown without test input grid, but error suggests missing None-checks (e.g., if not bottom_port: continue) and better error handling for attachments. To handle test, add guards around unpacking (e.g., if bottom_port and len(bottom_port)==4: ... ) and skip invalid chains/pieces.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction and rearrangement of colored connected components (blobs) from an input grid into a structured output grid, resembling a "train" or modular vehicle layout with vertical or horizontal configurations, connected by red (2) trim elements, and specific alignments for colors like green (3), maroon (8), blue (1), yellow (4), and pink (6). The output preserves the relative shapes of input blobs but repositions them with rules for adjacency, trims, and stacking, while leaving most of the grid as 0s and avoiding overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Configurations depend on color presence: vertical stacking (e.g., green on top, then maroon, red trims below) if no pink (6); horizontal layout (e.g., pink first, then side-by-side blue/yellow/green) if pink present—mismatching this leads to wrong starting positions and overlaps.
 * Red (2) acts as connectors/trims: vertical trims below blob bottoms (using leg positions from bottom row DCs), horizontal trims adjacent to sides (e.g., left of blue); but avoid over-adding reds in non-connection spots, as this fills empty areas incorrectly.
 * Extract and place blobs relatively: Use min_r/min_c offsets to normalize shapes, then place at fixed starts (e.g., green at r=4,c=8; blue at c=10; yellow at c=9); preserve exact sparsity/holes in blobs (e.g., don't fill greens or maroons solidly).
 * Alignments and abutments: Blue abuts yellow horizontally (as pivot), green abuts blue rightward; maroon often below or right-shifted; extras (e.g., orange=5) stacked rightward vertically; subtle overlaps allowed in some configs (e.g., maroon start_r = red_r +1).
 * Height calculations: Use max dr +1 for stacking next components below (e.g., red at h_green, maroon at red_r+1); approximate gaps (+1 or +3) for spacing, but avoid hardcoding if shapes vary.
 * Extra colors: Place remaining colors (beyond 1,2,3,4,8) stacked vertically on right (c=17), but only if present; don't invent or misplace like 7/9 in test.
 * Subtle omissions: Top 4 rows always 0s; no distortion of input shapes (e.g., green in ex1 is sparse with holes, not solid); connections only at specific points (e.g., blue-maroon bbox adjacents); handle empty positions gracefully (early return if no pos).
 * Across attempts: Fixed starts (e.g., current_y=4) work for top placement but fail if shapes taller; simplistic red additions (loop over r,c=[12,16,...]) pollute grid; reuse of rules (e.g., rule_cluster_blue_yellow calling others) causes duplication/misplacement; vertical vs horizontal mode helps but buggy (e.g., yellow below in horizontal mode overlaps).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_positions(g: List[List[int]], color: int, size: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(r, c) for r in range(size) for c in range(size) if g[r][c] == color]
```
(Extracts all positions of a color—essential for identifying blobs.)

```python
def extract_relative(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if not pos:
        return 0, 0, []
    min_r = min(r for r, c in pos)
    min_c = min(c for r, c in pos)
    rel = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in pos]
    return min_r, min_c, rel
```
(Normalizes blob to (0,0) origin—key for preserving shape when placing.)

```python
def place_component(output: List[List[int]], rel: List[Tuple[int, int]], color: int, start_r: int, start_c: int, size: int):
    for dr, dc in rel:
        if 0 <= start_r + dr < size and 0 <= start_c + dc < size:
            output[start_r + dr][start_c + dc] = color
```
(Places a normalized blob at a start position, bounds-checked—core for non-overlapping insertion.)

```python
def add_red_trims_vertical(output: List[List[int]], leg_positions: List[int], start_r: int, start_c: int, size: int):
    for dc in leg_positions:
        if 0 <= start_r < size and 0 <= start_c + dc < size:
            output[start_r][start_c + dc] = 2
```
(Adds vertical red trim below a blob's bottom legs—useful but limited to vertical; needs horizontal counterpart.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Mode detection (if 6 in colors) correctly branches to horizontal (pink-led) vs vertical (green-led), but execution fails: in ex1 (no pink, vertical), green/maroon/red stack roughly aligns but green is solid-filled (ignores input sparsity), extra reds at c=16/17 pollute right side, blue/yellow placed too low/right with wrong shapes (e.g., yellow at r=11-13,c=10-11 overlaps red), orange(5) misplaced low-right.
 * In ex2 (pink present, horizontal), pink places okay but with extra reds below/immediately, maroon shifts wrong (to c=12 but overlaps pink reds), blue/green/yellow cluster misaligned (e.g., blue at c=10 but with wrong rel shape, green at c=13 but sparse input not preserved), yellow below pink at +3 gap but overlaps, tons of extra reds from final loop fill lower grid uselessly.
 * What worked: Blob extraction/placement basics (shapes mostly preserved in size, colors correct); vertical trim logic identifies bottom legs accurately; extra color stacking attempts right-side vertical.
 * What didn't: Over-adds reds (e.g., horizontal simplistic in rule_horizontal_blue_maroon_red only at fixed [start_y][start_c-1], but misses full bbox; final loop adds irrelevant reds at fixed c=[9,10,12,13,16]); ignores input blob sparsity (e.g., ex1 green row4 solid 3s vs expected sparse; ex2 maroon row5-6 has 2s inside); wrong starts/gaps (e.g., ex1 maroon at r=7,c=8 but expected r=7,c=8 sparse; ex2 yellow not clustered properly); no horizontal trim function (reuses vertical wrongly); place_pink_horizontal buggy (red_r_m = max(...) but leg_dcs_m uses wrong bottom_dr).
 * rule_pivot_yellow_blue_green and rule_align_green_blue help chain placements but cause overlaps/duplication when called in wrong order/mode.
 * add_red_trims_vertical is helpful for vertical but broken for horizontal (needs dc/r swap); place_extra_color good for extras but starts at fixed c=17, stacks with +1 gap (may overlap if tall).
 * Overall, program understands component extraction but fails on precise positioning, sparsity, and targeted reds—leads to cluttered, mismatched outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows a messy vertical stack starting at r=4 with green(3) partially sparse but with extra 2s inside (e.g., row5 c=9-10=2, expected clean), maroon(8) at r=9-12 but fragmented/wrong rel (e.g., row10 c=8=8 but then 2s/0s), yellow(4)/blue(1) at r=14-16 mixed with 1s/2s but shapes distorted (e.g., row15 c=11=1 inside yellow?), extras like 7 (r=17 c=17-22 solid, possibly orange-like but wrong color/placement) and 9 (r=19-25 scattered low-right, wrong shape/position). Massive red pollution (2s at every connection and beyond, e.g., columns 16-17 filled vertically, row8-9 full 2-trim). Differs from expected pattern (based on trainings): Should have clean top-4 0s, sparse blobs, targeted reds only at bottoms/sides (e.g., no internal 2s, no invented 7/9 positions), right-side extras stacked without overlap, horizontal elements if pink (but test seems vertical-mode). Likely mode wrong or extraction failed for test input's colors/shapes; doesn't match training expectations of structured train without filler.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with colored components (connected groups of the same non-red color, excluding reds) and red cells (value 2) that act as attachment points. The goal is to extract these components, identify reds attached to exactly one component, place the yellow (color 4) component centrally in a new output grid, and then place other components by prioritizing alignments where their attached reds match positions of already-placed reds (for "snapping" attachments), falling back to heuristic placements (e.g., by centroid, size, or scanning positions) if no matches are found, while avoiding overlaps and staying within bounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected groups (up, down, left, right) of the same color; reds (2) are not part of components but can be "attached" if adjacent to exactly one component (diagonals not considered for attachment).
 * Yellow (4) is always placed first, shifted to the vertical center (row n//2 - minr) with no horizontal shift (dc=0), and its attached reds become the initial "placed_reds" set for snapping future components.
 * For other components, prioritize placements that maximize the number of attached reds that land on existing placed_reds positions (best_num_match), with ties broken by minimizing Manhattan distance (abs(dr) + abs(dc)); if no matches (best_num_match == 0), fall back to heuristic placement: sort components by average row centroid (top-to-bottom), place above yellow if centroid lower, below if higher, with horizontal scanning starting from yellow's left edge, adjusting for component height/width and red positions (e.g., if bottom reds align with component maxr and >=2 reds, shift right by yellow width).
 * Heuristic fallback scans horizontally first at a fixed dy, then increments dy and scans again if needed; this can fail if the initial dy is wrong (e.g., too high/low relative to yellow).
 * Output grid starts empty (0s); placements overwrite only if no conflict (can_place_shape checks for non-zero non-matching color); reds are placed as 2s but only if in bounds.
 * Subtle: Components with no attached reds are still placed via heuristics; sorting by centroid may not always respect left-right or attachment order; the program removes yellow after finding it, sorts remaining by centroid, but doesn't handle multiple yellows or missing yellow (returns empty if no yellow).
 * Easy to miss: Reds not attached to any component are ignored; placements must not overlap different colors; the fallback dy calculation for below-yellow assumes yellow's height but may misalign if component has protruding reds (e.g., bottom_reds_row check shifts right but adjusts dy down by component height minus yellow height, which can cause vertical overlap or gap).
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one provided): No rotation or flipping of components; assumes orthogonal placement only; n is grid size (square); empty rows/columns in input are preserved as 0 in output.
 * Potential edge cases: Components spanning full width (scanning fails); multiple components with same color (treated separately if disconnected); reds touching multiple components are unassigned; if heuristic scan exhausts bounds without placement, component is dropped (not placed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # 4-directional connectivity for components and attachments

    # Core placement logic; updates output in-place; filters out-of-bounds reds.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handles component extraction and red attachment (works for training 1).
 * Training 1 passed fully: yellow placed centrally, other components snapped or heuristically placed correctly, resulting in exact match.
 * Training 2 failed: Generated output misplaces components—e.g., 8-block placed where expected has 6-block (rows 5-6 leftish vs. expected rows 4-6 left), 6-block placed partially overlapping 1's and 3's area (row 7-9 right vs. expected row 4-6 left as 6's), 3-block scattered/misaligned (rows 11-15 mixed with 2's vs. expected rows 8-12 right as solid 3's), yellow (4) at rows 11-13 but with wrong horizontal shift and missing some 2's alignments; overall, snapping prioritized wrong matches (e.g., 8's reds didn't align to yellow's placed_reds properly), and fallback heuristics caused vertical/horizontal offsets (dy too low for below components, scanning started from wrong left=dc_y=0 leading to left-side crowding).
 * Fallback heuristic buggy: For components below yellow, dy = (n//2 + yellow_height) +1 often overshoots, and bottom_reds_row adjustment subtracts comp height minus yellow height but doesn't account for yellow's placed position (dr_y shift); this dropped or mis-scanned some placements, leaving gaps (e.g., row 14 empty in generated vs. expected has nothing but positions differ).
 * Sorting by average row centroid works for top-bottom order but ignores left-right priorities or red-based chaining (e.g., if comp A must attach to B before C).
 * Snapping loop iterates over each red in comp to each placed_red, but only picks best per comp (not per-red chaining); this misses multi-step attachments.
 * find_components excludes color 2 correctly but treats all other >0 as valid (even if isolated single cells); unhelpful if puzzle has invalid colors, but seems fine.
 * No unhelpful functions: All provided (find_components, find_attached_reds, can_place_shape, place_shape) are core and helpful; main program logic is the issue (snapping/heuristic).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on inferred rules: It places 9-block (likely a long horizontal with holes/reds) at rows 5-8 left-center, then 8-block (long horizontal with extensions) at rows 10-16 center-right attached via 2's, 4 (yellow?) at rows 13-16 center overlapping 8's area (but can_place_shape should block this unless same color—wait, 4 !=8, so overlap invalid, suggesting bug in validation or order), 1's scattered as attachments to 8's, 3-block at bottom-left rows 16-19 vertical, 7-block at row 16 right as horizontal. This crowds center-bottom, ignores potential top placements (e.g., empty rows 0-4 could fit smaller comps like 1's or unattached), and 2's are placed but don't chain properly (e.g., 9's 2's in row 7-9 don't snap to yellow's reds, which seem missing or unplaced centrally). Expected should start with yellow (4) at vertical center (row ~11-13 for n=26?), then snap/place others upward/downward without overlaps (e.g., 9's above if centroid low, 7's right-attached, 3's bottom without crowding 8's); generated has no central yellow visible (4's are low and partial), many empty top rows (suggests sorting/centroid failed to place top comps), and 2's in row 20 bottom not attached—likely heuristic scan exhausted bounds or wrong dy for bottom comps. Differences: Overlaps (4 on 8?), wrong vertical stacking (all piled mid-bottom vs. balanced top-bottom), missing chaining (e.g., 1's should snap to multiple placed 2's but appear loose).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual assembly puzzle where colored polyomino-like components (excluding empty space 0 and red attachments 2) must be extracted from an input grid, repositioned on a new blank grid with the yellow component (color 4) anchored vertically at the grid's middle row (n//2), and other components attached or positioned relative to it using red dots as docking ports, prioritizing multi-point alignments before fallback rules for singles or unattached pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected groups of the same non-zero, non-red color; isolated cells count as components even if size 1.
 * Red cells (2) adjacent to exactly one component are "attached" to that component and move with it; reds adjacent to multiple or none are ignored for attachment.
 * Yellow (4) is always placed first, shifted only vertically to center its top row at n//2, with no horizontal shift (dc_y=0); its attached reds are placed as 2s.
 * Attachment prioritizes greedy placement: for shapes with reds, test all possible shifts (dr, dc) relative to existing placed reds, favoring shifts that match >=2 reds (or >=1 if the shape has only 1 red); among ties, prefer minimal Manhattan distance; only attempt shapes with at least one red.
 * Unplaced shapes after greedy phase use fallbacks: no-red shapes align top-left to yellow's position; single-red shapes dock to nearest existing red; multi-red shapes (assumed "B-type" if exactly 2 reds on the bottom row) try to align their bottom-left red pair to the leftmost row with >=2 reds (using the rightmost red in that row for horizontal offset, plus yellow's width); otherwise, default to yellow-aligned positioning.
 * All placements must stay within grid bounds [0,n-1]; out-of-bounds parts are clipped (not placed).
 * Output is a new grid with placed components and their attached reds (as 2s); unattachable or default-placed items still go on the grid but may overlap or misalign if rules fail.
 * Subtlety: Component bounding boxes (minr/maxr/minc/maxc) are used for default positioning but not for attachment—attachment is purely red-to-red matching.
 * Subtlety: When placing, shape cells overwrite output (no overlap checks); reds are added as 2s only if in bounds, and placed reds accumulate for future attachments.
 * Easy to miss: Yellow's width (y_width) is used in B-type horizontal offset to "append" right of yellow; candidate merge rows are only those with >=2 reds already placed.
 * Easy to miss: Greedy loop only considers shapes with reds; no-red shapes are always deferred to fallback.
 * Consideration: Grid size n is odd/even agnostic but centering assumes integer n//2; test inputs may have n=22 or 26 (even), affecting exact centering.
 * Consideration: Colors like 1,3,6,7,8,9 represent distinct shapes; no rotation/reflection—preserve input orientation and relative positions.
 * Consideration: If no yellow, output empty grid; if components empty, also empty.
 * Across attempts: Red attachment detection must use 4 directions only (no diagonals); stack-based flood fill for components to handle irregular shapes.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully: All components correctly extracted, yellow centered, attachments via reds worked (multi/single matches), fallbacks unused or correct—output matched expected.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated output mostly matched expected (yellow at row 4-5-ish, most shapes like 1,3,4,8 placed correctly with reds), but the 6-shape (likely a vertical piece with reds) was misplaced— in generated, row 5 has 6 at col7, then 8s starting col9 (overlapping/merged visually), row 6 has 6 at col7 then 8 at col10; expected has separate 6s at col7-9 in rows 5-6, with 8s shifted right starting col13. Effect: 6 appears attached to 8-block instead of independent/docked separately; unknown why—possibly greedy attachment favored 6 to existing 8-reds over correct single/distance, or fallback miscomputed dr/dc for 6's reds. Reds in row7 (2s at col7,9,12,15) placed correctly in both.
 * Greedy attachment loop worked partially: Successfully placed some multi-red shapes (e.g., 8-block docked), but over-prioritized or miscalculated shifts for 6, leading to partial overlap/misposition.
 * Fallback for multi-red (B-type) seemed unused or incorrect for 6 (if it had 2 bottom reds, didn't align to row with 2 reds properly).
 * find_components and find_attached_reds helpful and correct (components match input in both trains).
 * place_shape helpful but in train2, when placing 6, it overwrote or shifted into 8's space without clip handling the intent.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided are relevant, though the B-type fallback logic (port_row detection, merge_row candidates) may be buggy for non-exact-2-reds-on-bottom cases like 6.
 * extract_objects not present but implied in components—essential for shape isolation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (n=26) partially makes sense but likely incorrect overall: Yellow (4) correctly centered vertically around rows 14-17 (n//2=13, but placed starting row12 with vertical shift); components like 9 (top-right, rows7-10), 8 (rows11-13, docked via reds), 1 (rows13-16 left), 7 (row18 bottom-left), 3 (row19) extracted/placed visibly. Reds accumulated and used for docking (e.g., 2s in row12 col6/10, row17 col5/10). However, it doesn't look fully correct—e.g., the large 8 in row10 cols9-16 seems shifted left into where reds are, potentially overlapping unplaced space; bottom 2s in row20 cols6/10 undocked; shape 9's reds in row8 col14/18 not aligning to any existing 2s perfectly (single-red fallback?); overall layout spreads left-heavy, but puzzle likely expects tighter right-append via yellow width in B-type or better greedy multi-matches (e.g., if input has B-shapes with 2 bottom reds, they should align to rows like 12 with 2+ reds, offsetting by yellow's width ~6-7 cols). Missing: Potential clipping of out-of-bounds (e.g., input 9 at cols14-18 shifted to 14-18 ok, but 8's extent might clip); no empty rows at top/bottom as in trains, but input has them—output preserves spacing poorly. Effect: Shapes present but positions misaligned (e.g., 8/9 too close, 7/3 undocked left instead of appended); differs from train2 error pattern (mis-dock) but similar (greedy/fallback bug). To handle test, update greedy to better prioritize non-overlapping shifts or refine B-type to check all multi-red configs beyond just bottom-2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (the only examples with before/after states to observe interactions), the following are the only obvious, consistent connections or interactions between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (both train input/output pairs) and do not rely on solving the puzzle or inferring high-level rules. No such consistent patterns were identifiable in the test inputs alone (lacking outputs), so they are excluded from interaction analysis. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated reds with no nearby colored shapes, or properties like hole count which is always 0 and unchanged) are omitted. Specific shape details (e.g., L-shape vs. U-shape) cannot be confirmed from bbox/pixels data alone, so no shape-specific interactions are included. Overall transformation rules (e.g., why positions change) are unknown and not explained here.

- **Red single pixels ↔ Colored shapes (all non-red colors: Blue/Light Blue, Green, Yellow, Maroon/Dark Red, Orange, Pink)**:  
  Red pixels (1 pixel each) are consistently positioned adjacent to or overlapping the bounding boxes of colored shapes in inputs and outputs. Their relative positions to the attached shape remain consistent during changes (e.g., a red below a shape in input stays below it in output after position shift). This suggests reds act as attached "tips" or "accents" that move with the shape, affecting its effective silhouette or extension. Examples:  
  - In Train 1: Green shape ([1,18,5,19]) has reds directly below at y=20; after shift to [8,4,12,5], reds shift to directly below at y=6. Similarly for Blue, Maroon, Orange.  
  - In Train 2: Pink shape ([16,3,18,5]) has adjacent reds at (16,6)/(18,6); after shift to [7,4,9,6], reds shift to (7,7)/(9,7). Similarly for Blue, Green, Maroon.  
  No other colors (e.g., no self-contained reds without a nearby colored shape) show this attachment consistently.

- **Position of colored shape → Position of attached red pixels**:  
  When a colored shape's bbox changes (translation observed in both trains), the positions of its attached red pixels change by the same delta (x/y offset), preserving adjacency. This interaction is consistent for all moving shapes but does not apply to static ones. Pixel count of reds remains 1 (unchanged). Examples as above; no exceptions across trains.

- **Yellow shape properties → Stationary behavior**:  
  The Yellow shape (bbox roughly [9-12,11-14], pixels 9) consistently does not change position, size, or attached reds between input and output in both trains. Its attached reds (e.g., right-side or below) also remain fixed relative to it and the grid. This implies no interaction causing movement for Yellow, unlike other colors which translate. No other shape shows this consistent stationarity.

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color effects like Green affecting Blue position, or bbox width/height changing based on pixels) are consistent across both train examples—many vary (e.g., different translation deltas, occasional extra reds not clearly attached). Specific shape transformations (e.g., rotation vs. pure translation) are unknown due to limited bbox detail. No consistent interactions involving holes (always 0) or pixels count changes (stable per color).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:39:38] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored regions (numbers 1-9 represent colors, 2 represents special "red" connector cells) where the task is to extract connected components (blobs of the same color, excluding isolated 2's), optionally attach touching 2's to components, and rearrange them into a new empty grid by placing them in a specific order (yellow/4 first, then others sorted by vertical centroid) while maximizing connections between components via adjacent 2's and minimizing disruption to the overall centroid, ensuring no overlaps except on compatible 2's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of the same color >0 and !=2; isolated cells or non-connected same-color cells are separate components.
 * 2's (reds) are not part of components unless they touch exactly one component (subtle: touching multiple or none means they are loose or shared; the code attaches only singles, but expected outputs show some 2's placed independently or shared).
 * Yellow (4) is placed first, shifted vertically to center its top row at the grid's middle row (n//2), with no horizontal shift (dc_y=0), and its attached reds move with it; if no yellow, output empty grid.
 * Remaining components sorted by their input grid's vertical centroid (average row of cells, ignoring reds for centroid but including for bounding box); place in this order.
 * Placement prioritizes positions that maximize "connections": count of adjacent (horizontal/vertical) links where a component's cells touch existing 2's, or its reds touch existing non-2 cells; if component touches top/bottom in input, use all 4 directions for scoring, else only horizontal (subtle: this simulates "edge" behavior but may over/under-score vertical connections).
 * Among max-connection positions (no overlap on cells except same color, reds only on empty), choose the one minimizing Euclidean distance from the component's shifted centroid to the current output grid's overall centroid (average of all placed cells); ties broken by topmost row, then leftmost column.
 * Bounding box for placement: use min/max rows/cols of cells + attached reds to compute height/width; relative positions preserved.
 * Fallback if no valid position: try placing starting at row 4 (arbitrary?), left or right of current centroid based on if component's centroid is below current; shift right/down if overlap, or default to below center (subtle: this is heuristic and fails often, ignoring full search).
 * Update output centroid after each placement (includes all non-0 cells, so grows with additions).
 * Subtle omissions: code ignores loose 2's (not attached); doesn't handle shared 2's between components; yellow placement assumes min_r shift only, but expected may need horizontal alignment; sorting ignores reds for centroid but includes for bbox (inconsistent); search loops over all possible starts but may miss due to invalid checks (e.g., allows same-color overlap but not others); touch_top/bottom includes reds but uses arbitrary default=999/-1 for empty lists (risky if no cells/reds).
 * Grid size n x n (up to 26), outputs as list of lists; all placements must fit within bounds.
 * Puzzle goal: recreate a "assembled" image where components connect logically via 2's to form a cohesive picture, matching expected layouts exactly (e.g., specific positions, not just any connected).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly extracts components and attaches single-touching reds, places yellow vertically centered (dr_y = n//2 - min_r, dc_y=0), sorts remaining by input vertical centroid (cells only), and searches for placements maximizing connection score (adjacencies via 2's/cells) then minimizing centroid distance.
 * What worked: Component identification and red attachment match expected logic (e.g., in train1, yellow's reds are moved with it); yellow placement shifts correctly vertically; sorting by row-centroid approximates vertical build order seen in expecteds (bottom-to-top or similar).
 * What didn't: Fallback placement is broken/heuristic (starts at row 4, shifts arbitrarily, ignores full bounds/search, places below center without checks, leading to overlaps or mispositions); connection scoring uses conditional directions (only horiz if not edge-touching, but expecteds show vertical connections needed); search allows same-color overlap but not others, but misses shared/loose 2's (e.g., train1 generated places 1's and 5's connected wrongly, 3's shifted left by ~2 cols vs expected col8 start; 8's incomplete/misaligned; train2 generated places 4's and 3's low but 6's/8's/1's jumbled, missing expected upper placements like 6's at row4 col7).
 * Train1 generated: Empty top rows ok, but 3's at cols10-14 (expected cols8-12, shifted right); yellow (4) at rows11-13 cols9-12 with reds, but expected more spread and reds at specific spots (e.g., row12 col12=0 not 2); 8's partial at row7 cols9-13 but expected full row7 cols8-12; 1's and 5's clustered low-right but expected 1's vertical at cols13-15 rows12-16, 5's horizontal at row13 cols17-21; loose 2's ignored (e.g., expected has isolated 2's at row7 col8, row10 col9); overall, connections weak (few 2-adjacencies).
 * Train2 generated: Yellow (4) at rows11-13 cols10-12 but expected rows11-13 cols10-12 ok-ish, but 3's at row13 cols14-17 (expected row8 cols12-15? Wait, expected has 3's lower); 1's scattered; 6's and 8's misplaced low (generated row9-11, expected row4-5 for 6's col7-9, row5-6 for 8's col12-15); reds attached but some overlaps (e.g., generated row11 col11-13=2's overlapping expected 4's); loose 2's not placed (expected has them connecting 1's/3's).
 * Centroid calc bug: get_centroid uses sum(c for r,c in cells) for row? No, code has sum(r for r,c) for row ok, but comp_cent_c = sum(c for r,c in cells)/len ok; but in search, shifted_cent uses comp_cent_r - min_all_r (includes reds in min_all_r but not in cent_r, inconsistent).
 * extract_components and attach_reds are essential/helpful for blob handling; get_centroid and update_current_centroid useful for ordering/placement; touch_top/bottom somewhat helpful but flawed (defaults cause false positives if empty reds).
 * Fallback placement loop is unhelpful/broken (while start_r + height <=n but increments start_c then resets, may infinite or skip valid spots; simple below-center ignores overlaps entirely).
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding (connection via 2's, centroid sorting/placement) but fails on positioning (heuristic fallback, incomplete 2 handling) leading to no training matches; unknown why 3's/8's shift left/right consistently (perhaps bbox min_c off by input offsets).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (26x26 grid) places components but does not look fully correct: yellow (4) at rows13-16 cols9-12 with some 1's integrated wrongly (e.g., row14 col4-5=1's but seem detached); 3's at rows9-12 cols2-6 but extended oddly with 2's; 8's scattered (row10 col10-17, row18 col9-11) but incomplete connections (few 2-adjacencies to others); 9's at row17 cols12-16 and row20 col14-16 but isolated; 7's at bottom row22 cols10-15; loose 2's placed sporadically (e.g., row9 col2=2, row20 col12=2) but not all connected; overall centroid seems low/mid but expecteds suggest more balanced/upper starts (e.g., train1/2 have placements from row4 up); missing tight clustering seen in train expecteds (e.g., 5's/1's should chain via 2's vertically/horizontally); overlaps none visible but positions seem arbitrary (e.g., 9's far right but no attachment to 8's); does not match puzzle's likely "build connected picture" rule, as regions float disconnected—likely incorrect due to same fallback/search flaws as training (e.g., no max-connection enforcement, ignoring shared 2's).

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 03:39:38] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
